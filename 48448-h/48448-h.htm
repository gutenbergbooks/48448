<p>The Hon. Henry Wilson, recently
re-elected senator in Congress from
Massachusetts, may not be distinguished
as an original thinker or as
a statesman of commanding ability,
but no man is a surer index to his
party or a more trustworthy exponent
of its sentiments and tendencies,
its aims and purposes. This
gives to his article in <cite>The Atlantic
Monthly</cite>, indicating the policy to be
pursued by the Republican party, a
weight it might not otherwise possess.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson is a strong political partisan,
but he is above all a fervent
Evangelical, and his aim, we presume,
is to bring his political party
to coincide with his Evangelical party,
and make each strengthen the
other. We of course, as a Catholic
organ, have nothing to say of questions
in issue between different political
parties so long as they do not involve
the rights and interests of our
religion, or leave untouched the fundamental
principles and genius of the
American system of government, although
we may have more or less to
say as American citizens; but when
either party is so ill-advised as to aim
a blow either at the freedom of our
religion or at our federative system
of government, we hold ourselves
free, and in duty bound, to warn our
fellow-citizens and our fellow-Catholics
of the impending danger, and
to do what we can to avert or arrest
the blow. We cannot, without
incurring grave censure, betray by our
silence the cause of our religion or of
our country, for fear that by speaking
we may cross the purposes of one
or another party, and seem to favor
the views and policy of another.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson's <cite>New Departure</cite> is
unquestionably revolutionary, and
therefore not lawful for any party
in this country to adopt. It is expressed
in two words, <span class="smcap">National
Unification</span> and <span class="smcap">National Education</span>&mdash;that
is, the consolidation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>all the powers of government in the
general government, and the social
and religious unification of the American
people by means of a system
of universal and uniform compulsory
education, adopted and enforced by
the authority of the united or consolidated
states, not by the states severally
each within its own jurisdiction
and for its own people. The first
is decidedly revolutionary and destructive
of the American system of
federative government, or the division
of powers between a general
government and particular state
governments; the second, in the
sense proposed, violates the rights
of parents and annihilates the religious
liberty secured by the constitution
and laws both of the several
states and of the United States.</p>

<p>The general government, in our
American political system, is not the
national government, or any more
national than the several state governments.
The national government
with us is divided between a general
government having charge of our relations
with other powers and internal
matters of a general nature and
common to all the states, and particular
state governments having
charge of matters local and particular
in their nature, and clothed with
all the powers of supreme national
governments not expressly delegated
to the general government. In the
draft of the federal constitution reported
by the committee to the convention
of 1787, the word <i>national</i>
was used, but the convention finally
struck it out, and inserted wherever
it occurred the word <i>general</i>, as more
appropriately designating the character
and powers of the government
they were creating. It takes under
our actual system both the state governments
and the general government
to make one complete national
government, invested with all the powers
of government. By making the
general government a supreme national
government, we make it the source
of all authority, subordinate the state
governments to it, make them hold
from it, and deprive them of all independent
or undivided rights. This
would completely subvert our system
of government, according to which
the states hold their powers immediately
from the political people, and
independently of any suzerain or overlord,
and the general government
from the states or the people organized
as states united in convention.
A more complete change of the government
or destruction of the federative
principle, which constitutes the
chief excellence and glory of our system,
it would be difficult to propose,
or even to conceive, than is set forth
in Mr. Wilson's programme.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson, however, is hardly
justified in calling the revolution he
proposes a "New Departure." It
has been the aim of a powerful party,
under one name or another, ever since
1824, if not from the origin of the
government itself. This party has
been steadily pursuing it, and with
increasing numbers and influence,
ever since the anti-slavery agitation seriously
commenced. At one time, and
probably at all times, it has been
moved chiefly by certain business
interests which it could not advance
according to its mind by state legislation,
and for which it desired federal
legislation and the whole power of
a national government, but which it
could not get because the constitution
and the antagonistic interests
created by slave labor were opposed
to it. It then turned philanthropist
and called in philanthropy to its aid&mdash;philanthropy
which makes light
of constitutions and mocks at state
lines, and claims the right to go
wherever it conceives the voice of
humanity calls it. Under the pretext<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of philanthropy, the party turned
abolitionist, and sought to bring under
the action of the general government
the question of slavery manifestly
reserved to the states severally,
and which it belonged to each to
settle for itself in its own way. A
civil war followed. The slaves were
emancipated, and slavery abolished,
professedly under the war-power of
the Union, as a military necessity,
which nobody regrets. But the party
did not stop here. Forgetful that
the extraordinary war-power ceases
with the war, and military necessity
can no longer be pleaded, it has, under
one pretext or another, such as
protecting and providing for the freed-men
and reconstructing the states
that seceded, continued to exercise it
ever since the war was over, and by
constitutional amendments of doubtful
validity, since ratified in part under
military pressure by states not yet reconstructed
or held to be duly organized
states in the Union, it has
sought to legitimate it, and to incorporate
it into the constitution as one
of the ordinary peace-powers of the
government.</p>

<p>The party has sometimes coincided,
and sometimes has not strictly coincided,
with one or another of the great
political parties that have divided the
country, but it has always struggled
for the consolidation of all the powers
of government in the general government.
Whether prompted by business
interests or by philanthropy, its
wishes and purposes have required
it to get rid of all co-ordinate and
independent bodies that might interfere
with, arrest, or limit the power
of Congress, or impose any limitation
on the action of the general government
not imposed by the arbitrary
will of the majority of the people, irrespective
of their state organization.</p>

<p>What the distinguished senator
urges we submit, therefore, is simply
the policy of consolidation or centralization
which his party has steadily
pursued from the first, and which
it has already in good part consummated.
It has abolished slavery, and
unified the labor system of the Union;
it has contracted a public debt,
whether needlessly or not, large
enough to secure to the consolidation
of the powers of a national government
in the general government the
support of capitalists, bankers, railroad
corporators, monopolists, speculators,
projectors, and the business
world generally. Under pretence of
philanthropy, and of carrying out
the abolition of slavery, and abolishing
all civil and political distinctions
of race or color, it has usurped for
the general government the power to
determine the question of suffrage
and eligibility, under the constitution
and by the genius of our government
reserved to the states severally,
and sends the military and swarms
of federal inspectors into the states
to control, or at least to look after,
the elections, in supreme contempt of
state authority. It has usurped for
the general government the power
of granting charters of incorporation
for private business purposes elsewhere
than in the District of Columbia,
and induced it to establish national
bureaus of agriculture and education,
as if it was the only and unlimited
government of the country,
which it indeed is fast becoming.</p>

<p>The work of consolidation or unification
is nearly completed, and there
remains little to do except to effect the
social and religious unification of the
various religions, sects, and races that
make up the vast and diversified
population of the country; and it is
clear from Mr. Wilson's programme
that his party contemplate moulding
the population of European and of
African origin, Indians and Asiatics,
Protestants and Catholics, Jews and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
pagans, into one homogeneous people,
after what may be called the New
England Evangelical type. Neither
his politics nor his philanthropy can
tolerate any diversity of ranks, conditions,
race, belief, or worship. A
complete unification must be effected,
and under the patronage and authority
of the general government.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson appears not to have
recognized any distinction between
unity and union. Union implies plurality
or diversity; unity excludes
both. Yet he cites, without the least
apparent misgiving, the fathers of
the republic&mdash;Washington, Adams,
Jefferson, Hamilton, Jay, and Madison&mdash;who
were strenuous for the union
of the several states, as authorities
in favor of their unity or consolidation
in one supreme national government.
There were points in
which these great men differed among
themselves&mdash;some of them wished to
give more, some of them less, power
to the general government&mdash;some of
them would give more, some of them
less, power to the executive, etc., but
they all agreed in their efforts to establish
the union of the states, and not
one of them but would have opposed
their unity or consolidation into a
single supreme government. Mr.
Wilson is equally out in trying, as
he does, to make it appear that the
strong popular sentiment of the American
people, in favor of union, is a
sentiment in favor of unity or unification.</p>

<p>But starting with the conception
of unity or consolidation, and resolving
republicanism into the absolute
supremacy of the will of the
people, irrespective of state organization,
Mr. Wilson can find no stopping-place
for his party short of the
removal of all constitutional or organic
limitations on the irresponsible
will of the majority for the time, which
he contends should in all things be
supreme and unopposed. His republicanism,
as he explains it, is therefore
incompatible with a well-ordered
state, and is either no government
at all, but universal anarchy, or
the unmitigated despotism of majorities&mdash;a
despotism more oppressive
and crushing to all true freedom and
manly independence, than any autocracy
that the world has ever seen.
The fathers of the republic never
understood republicanism in this
sense. They studied to restrict the
sphere of power, and to guard against
the supremacy of mere will, whether
of the monarch, the nobility, or the
people.</p>

<p>But having reached the conclusion
that true republicanism demands unification,
and the removal of all restrictions
on the popular will, Mr.
Wilson relies on the attachment of
the American people to the republican
idea to carry out and realize his
programme, however repugnant it
may be to what they really desire
and suppose they are supporting.
He knows the people well enough to
know that they do not usually discriminate
with much niceness, and that
they are easily caught and led away
by a few high-sounding phrases and
popular catchwords, uttered with due
gravity and assurance&mdash;perhaps he
does not discriminate very nicely, and
is himself deceived by the very phrases
and catchwords which deceive them.
It is not impossible. At any rate,
he persuades himself unification or
consolidation can be carried forward
and effected by appeals to the republican
instincts and tendencies of the
American people, and secured by aid
of the colored vote and woman suffrage,
soon to be adopted as an essential
element in the revolutionary
movement. The colored people, it
is expected, will vote as their preachers
direct, and their preachers will
direct as they are directed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Evangelicals. The women who will
vote, if woman suffrage is adopted,
are evangelicals, philanthropists, or
humanitarians, and are sure to follow
their instincts and vote for the unification
or centralization of power&mdash;the
more unlimited, the better.</p>

<p>But the chief reliance for the permanence
in power of the party of
consolidation is universal and uniform
compulsory education by the
general government, which will, if
adopted, complete and preserve the
work of unification. Education is
the American hobby&mdash;regarded, as
uneducated or poorly educated people
usually regard it, as a sort of panacea
for all the ills that flesh is heir
to. We ourselves, as Catholics, are
as decidedly as any other class of
American citizens in favor of universal
education, as thorough and
extensive as possible&mdash;if its quality
suits us. We do not, indeed, prize
so highly as some of our countrymen
appear to do the simple ability to
read, write, and cipher; nor do we
believe it possible to educate a whole
people so that every one, on attaining
his majority, will understand the
bearing of all political questions or
comprehend the complexities of
statesmanship, the effects at large of
all measures of general or special
legislation, the bearing on productive
industry and national wealth of this
or that financial policy, the respective
merits of free trade and protection,
or what in a given time or
given country will the best secure individual
freedom and the public good.
This is more than we ourselves can
understand, and we believe we are
better educated than the average
American. We do not believe that
the great bulk of the people of any
nation can ever be so educated as to
understand the essential political, financial,
and economical questions of
government for themselves, and they
will always have to follow blindly
their leaders, natural or artificial.
Consequently, the education of the
leaders is of far greater importance
than the education of those who are
to be led. All men have equal natural
rights, which every civil government
should recognize and protect,
but equality in other respects, whether
sought by levelling downward or
by levelling upward, is neither practicable
nor desirable. Some men are
born to be leaders, and the rest are
born to be led. Go where we will
in society, in the halls of legislation,
the army, the navy, the university, the
college, the district school, the family,
we find the few lead, the many follow.
It is the order of nature, and we
cannot alter it if we would. Nothing
can be worse than to try to educate
all to be leaders. The most pitiable
sight is a congressional body in which
there is no leader, an army without
a general, but all lead, all command&mdash;that
is, nobody leads or commands.
The best ordered and administered
state is that in which the few are well
educated and lead, and the many
are trained to obedience, are willing
to be directed, content to follow, and
do not aspire to be leaders. In the
early days of our republic, when the
few were better educated than now
and the many not so well, in the ordinary
sense of the term, there was
more dignity in the legislative, judicial,
and executive branches of the
government, more wisdom and justice
in legislation, and more honesty,
fidelity, and capacity in the administration.
In extending education and
endeavoring to train all to be leaders,
we have only extended presumption,
pretension, conceit, indocility, and
brought incapacity to the surface.</p>

<p>These, we grant, are unpopular
truths, but they, nevertheless, are
truths, which it is worse than idle to
deny. Everybody sees it, feels it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
but few have the courage to avow it
in face of an intolerant and tyrannical
public opinion. For ourselves, we
believe the peasantry in old Catholic
countries, two centuries ago, were
better educated, although for the
most part unable to read or write,
than are the great body of the American
people to-day. They had faith,
they had morality, they had a sense
of religion, they were instructed in
the great principles and essential
truths of the Gospel, were trained to
be wise unto salvation, and they had
the virtues without which wise, stable,
and efficient government is impracticable.
We hear it said, or rather
read in the journals, that the superiority
the Prussian troops have
shown to the French is due to their
superior education. We do not believe
a word of it. We have seen no
evidence that the French common
soldiers are not as well educated and
as intelligent as the Prussian. The
superiority is due to the fact that the
Prussian officers were better educated
in their profession, were less overweening
in their confidence of victory,
and maintained better and severer
discipline in their armies, than the
French officers. The Northern armies
in our recent civil war had no
advantage in the superior education
of the rank and file over the Southern
armies, where both were equally
well officered and commanded. The
<em>morale</em> of an army is no doubt the
great thing, but it does not depend
on the ability of the common soldier
to read, write, and cipher; it depends
somewhat on his previous habits and
pursuits&mdash;chiefly on the officers. Under
the first Napoleon, the Prussians
were not superior to the French,
though as well educated. Good officers,
with an able general at their
head, can make an efficient army out
of almost any materials.</p>

<p>It is not, therefore, for political or
military reasons that we demand universal
education, whether by the general
government or under the state governments.
We demand it, as far as
practicable, for other and far higher
reasons. We want it for a spiritual or
religious end. We want our children
to be educated as thoroughly as they
can be, but in relation to the great
purpose of their existence, so as to be
fitted to gain the end for which God
creates them. For the great mass of
the people, the education needed is
not secular education, which simply
sharpens the intellect and generates
pride and presumption, but moral
and religious education, which trains
up children in the way they should
go, which teaches them to be honest
and loyal, modest and unpretending,
docile and respectful to their superiors,
open and ingenuous, obedient
and submissive to rightful authority,
parental or conjugal, civil or ecclesiastical;
to know and keep the commandments
of God and the precepts
of the church; and to place the salvation
of the soul before all else in
life. This sort of education can be
given only by the church or under
her direction and control; and as
there is for us Catholics only one
church, there is and can be no proper
education for us not given by or under
the direction and control of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>But it is precisely education by the
Catholic Church that Mr. Wilson
and his party do not want, do not
believe in, and wish to prevent us
from having even for our own children.
It is therefore they demand a system
of universal and uniform compulsory
education by the authority and
under the direction of the general
government, which shall effect and
maintain the national unification proposed,
by compelling all the children
of the land to be trained in national
schools, under Evangelical control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and management. The end and aim
of the <cite>New Departure</cite>, aside from
certain business interests, is to suppress
Catholic education, gradually
extinguish Catholicity in the country,
and to form one homogeneous American
people after the New England
Evangelical type. Of this there can
be no reasonable doubt. The Evangelicals
and their humanitarian allies,
as all their organs show, are seriously
alarmed at the growth of Catholicity
in the United States. They supposed,
at first, that the church could
never take root in our Protestant
soil, that she could not breathe the atmosphere
of freedom and enlightenment,
or thrive in a land of newspapers
and free schools. They have
been disappointed, and now see that
they reckoned without their host,
and that, if they really mean to prevent
the American people from gradually
becoming Catholic, they must
change fundamentally the American
form of government, suppress the
freedom of religion hitherto enjoyed
by Catholics, and take the training
of all children and youth into their
own hands. If they leave education
to the wishes and judgment of parents,
Catholic parents will bring up
their children Catholics; if they leave
it to the states separately, Catholics
in several of them are already a powerful
minority, daily increasing in
strength and numbers, and will soon
be strong enough to force the state
legislatures to give them their proportion
of the public schools supported
at the public expense.</p>

<p>All this is clear enough. What, then,
is to be done? Mr. Wilson, who is
not remarkable for his reticence, tells
us, if not with perfect frankness,
yet frankly enough for all practical
purposes. It is to follow out the tendency
which has been so strengthened
of late, and absorb the states in the
Union, take away the independence
of the state governments, and assume
the control of education for the general
government, already rendered
practically the supreme national government;&mdash;then,
by appealing to the
popular sentiment in favor of education,
and saying nothing of its quality,
get Congress, which the Evangelicals,
through the party in power, already
control, to establish a system
of compulsory education in national
schools&mdash;and the work is done; for
these schools will necessarily fall into
Evangelical hands.</p>

<p>Such is what the distinguished
Evangelical senator from Massachusetts
calls a "New Departure," but
which is really only carrying out a
policy long since entered upon, and
already more than half accomplished.
While we are writing, Mr. Hoar,
a representative in Congress from
Massachusetts, has introduced into the
House of Representatives a bill establishing
a system of national education
under the authority of the general
government. Its fate is not
yet known, but no doubt will be, before
we go to press. The probabilities
are that it will pass both Houses,
and if it does, it will receive the signature
of the President as a matter
of course. The Evangelicals&mdash;under
which name we include Congregationalists,
Presbyterians, Dutch Reformed,
Baptists, and Methodists,
etc.&mdash;all the denominations united in
the Evangelical Alliance&mdash;constitute,
with their political and philanthropic
allies, the majority in Congress, and
the measure is advocated apparently
by the whole Evangelical press and
by the larger and more influential
republican journals of the country,
as any number of excerpts from them
now before us will satisfy any one who
has the curiosity to read them. We
did think of selecting and publishing
the more striking and authoritative
among them, but we have concluded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to hold them in reserve, to be produced
in case any one should be rash enough
to question our general statement.
There is a strong popular feeling in
many parts of the country in favor
of the measure, which is a pet measure
also of the Evangelical ministers generally,
who are sure to exert their
powerful influence in its support, and
we see no reason to doubt that the
bill will pass.</p>

<p>But while we see ample cause for
all citizens who are loyal to the system
of government which Providence
enabled our fathers to establish, and
who wish to preserve it and the liberties
it secures, to be vigilant and active,
we see none for alarm. The
bill, if it passes, will be manifestly
unconstitutional, even counting the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments
as valid parts of the constitution;
and there may be more difficulty
in carrying it into effect than its
framers anticipate. It is part and
parcel of a New England policy, and
New England is not omnipotent
throughout the Union, nor very ardently
loved; not all the members
of the several evangelical denominations
will, when they understand it,
favor the revolution in the government
Mr. Wilson would effect. There
are in those denominations many men
who belong not to the dominant party,
and who will follow their political
rather than their denominational affinities;
also, there are in them a large
number, we should hope, of honest
men, who are not accustomed to act
on the maxim, "the end justifies the
means," loyal men and patriotic, who
consider it no less disloyalty to seek
to revolutionize our government
against the states than against the
Union, and who will give their votes
and all their influence to preserve the
fundamental principles and genius of
our federative system of government,
as left us by our fathers, and resist,
if need be, to the death the disloyal
policy of unification and education
proposed by Mr. Wilson.</p>

<p>The Southern states are reconstructed
and back now in their place
in the Union, and will not be much
longer represented by Northern adventurers,
or men of little ability and
less character, but very soon by genuine
Southern men, who, while strictly
loyal to the Union, will speak the
genuine sentiments of the Southern
people. The attempt to New-Englandize
the Southern people has not
succeeded, and will not succeed.
When to the Southern people, who
will never acquiesce in the policy of
unification, we add the large number
of people in the Northern states
who from their political convictions
and affinities, as well as from their
conservative tendencies, will oppose
consolidation, we may feel pretty sure
that the policy Mr. Wilson presents
as that of the Republican party will
not be adopted, or if adopted will
not be permitted to stand. As not
wholly inexperienced in political matters,
and looking at the present state
of parties and temper of the nation,
we should say that Mr. Wilson, as a
party man, has committed a blunder,
and that, if he has fancied that his
<cite>New Departure</cite> is fitted to strengthen
his party as a political party, and to
give it a new lease of power, he has
miscalculated. Nothing in our judgment
would be more fatal to the continuance
of his party in power than
for it boldly and unequivocally to accept
Mr. Wilson's programme. There
is such a thing as reaction in human
affairs, and reactions are sometimes
very powerful.</p>

<p>The educational question ought
not to present any serious difficulty,
and would not if our Evangelicals
and humanitarians did not wish to
make education a means of preventing
the growth of the church and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
unmaking the children of Catholics,
as Catholics; or if they seriously and
in good faith would accept the religious
equality before the state which
the constitution and laws, both of
the Union and the several states,
as yet recognize and protect. No
matter what we claim for the Catholic
Church in the theological order&mdash;we
claim for her in the civil order
in this country only equality with
the sects, and for Catholics only
equal rights with citizens who are
not Catholics. We demand the freedom
of conscience and the liberty of
our church, which is our conscience,
enjoyed by Evangelicals. This much
the country in its constitution and
laws has promised us, and this much
it cannot deny us without breaking
its faith pledged before the world.</p>

<p>As American citizens, we object to
the assumption of the control of education,
or of any action in regard to
it, by the general government; for
it has no constitutional right to meddle
with it, and so far as civil government
has any authority in relation
to it, it is, under our system of government,
the authority of the states
severally, not of the states united.
We deny, of course, as Catholics, the
right of the civil government to educate,
for education is a function of the
spiritual society, as much so as
preaching and the administration of
the sacraments; but we do not deny
to the state the right to establish and
maintain public schools. The state,
if it chooses, may even endow religion,
or pay the ministers of religion
a salary for their support; but
its endowments of religion, when
made, are made to God, are sacred,
and under the sole control and management
of the spiritual authority,
and the state has no further function
in regard to them but to protect
the spirituality in the free and
full possession and enjoyment of
them. If it chooses to pay the ministers
of religion a salary, as has
been done in France and Spain,
though accepted by the Catholic
clergy only as a small indemnification
for the goods of the church seized
by revolutionary governments and
appropriated to secular uses, it acquires
thereby no rights over them
or liberty to supervise their discharge
of their spiritual functions. We do
not deny the same or an equal right
in regard to schools and school-teachers.
It may found and endow schools
and pay the teachers, but it cannot
dictate or interfere with the education
or discipline of the school. That
would imply a union of church and
state, or, rather, the subjection of the
spiritual order to the secular, which
the Catholic Church and the American
system of government both alike
repudiate.</p>

<p>It is said, however, that the state
needs education for its own protection,
and to promote the public good
or the good of the community, both
of which are legitimate ends of its
institution. What the state needs in
relation to its legitimate ends, or the
ends for which it is instituted, it has
the right to ordain and control. This
is the argument by which all public
education by the state is defended.
But it involves an assumption which
is not admissible. The state, having
no religious or spiritual function, can
give only secular education, and secular
education is not enough for the
state's own protection or its promotion
of the public good. Purely secular
education, or education divorced
from religion, endangers the safety
of the state and the peace and security
of the community, instead of protecting
and insuring them. It is not
in the power of the state to give the
education it needs for its own sake,
or for the sake of secular society.
The fact is, though statesmen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
especially politicians, are slow to
learn it, and still slower to acknowledge
it, the state, or secular society,
does not and cannot suffice for itself,
and is unable to discharge its
own proper functions without the co-operation
and aid of the spiritual society.
Purely secular education creates
no civic virtues, and instead of fitting
unfits the people for the prompt
and faithful discharge of their civic
duties, as we may see in Young America,
and indeed in the present active
and ruling generation of the American
people. Young America is impatient
of restraint, regards father and
mother as old-fogies, narrow-minded,
behind the age, and disdains filial
submission or obedience to them, has
no respect for dignities, acknowledges
no superior, mocks at law if he
can escape the police, is conceited,
proud, self-sufficient, indocile, heedless
of the rights and interests of
others&mdash;will be his own master, and
follow his own instincts, passions, or
headstrong will. Are these the characteristics
of a people fitted to maintain
a wise, well-ordered, stable, and
beneficent republican government?
Or can such a people be developed
from such youngerlings? Yet with
purely secular education, however
far you carry it, experience proves
that you can get nothing better.</p>

<p>The church herself, even if she
had full control of the education of
all the children in the land, with ample
funds at her command, could not
secure anything better, if, as the state,
she educated for a secular end alone.
The virtues needed for the protection
of the state and the advancement
of the public or common good, are
and can be secured only by educating
or training the children and
youth of a nation not for this life
as an end, but for the life to
come. Hence our Lord says, "Seek
first the kingdom of God and his
justice, and all these things shall be
added unto you." The church does
not educate for the secular order as
an end, but for God and heaven;
and it is precisely in educating for
God and heaven that she secures
those very virtues on which the welfare
and security of the secular order
depend, and without which civil society
tends inevitably to dissolution,
and is sustained, if sustained at all,
only by armed force, as we have seen
in more than one European nation
which has taken education into its
own hand, and subordinated it to
secular ends. The education needed
by secular society can be obtained
only from the spiritual society, which
educates not for this world, but for
the world to come. The virtues needed
to secure this life are obtained
only by seeking and promoting the
virtues which fit us for eternal life.</p>

<p>This follows necessarily from the
fact that man is created with a spiritual
nature and for an immortal destiny.
If he existed for this life only,
if he were, as some sciolists pretend,
merely a monkey or a gorilla developed,
or were like the beasts that
perish, this indeed would not and
could not follow, and the reconciliation
of the nature and destiny of
man with uniform human experience
would be impossible. We should be
obliged, in order to secure the peace
and good order of society, as some
unbelieving statesmen do not blush
to avow, to educate in view of a
falsehood, and take care to keep up
the delusion that man has a religious
nature and destiny, or look to what
is false and delusive for the virtues
which can alone save us from anarchy
and utter barbarism. Yet what
would serve the delusion or the falsehood,
if man differs not by nature from
the dog or the pig? But if man has
really a spiritual nature and an immortal
destiny, then it must necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
follow that his real good can in
no respect be obtained but in being
educated and trained to live for a
spiritual life, for an immortal destiny.
Should not man be educated according
to his spiritual nature and destiny,
not as a pig or a monkey? If so,
in his education should not the secular
be subordinated to the spiritual,
and the temporal to the eternal?
We know well, experience proves it,
that even the secular virtues are not
secured when sought as the end of
education and of life, but only in
educating and living for that which
is not secular, and in securing the
virtues which have the promise of
the life of the world to come.</p>

<p>All education, as all life, should be
religious, and all education divorced
from religion is an evil, not a good,
and is sure in the long run to be ruinous
to the secular order; but as a part
of religious education, and included
in it, secular education has its
place, and even its necessity. Man is
not all soul, nor all body, but the
union of soul and body; and therefore
his education should include in
their union, not separation&mdash;for the
separation of soul and body is the
death of the body&mdash;both spiritual
education and secular. It is not that
we oppose secular education when
given in the religious education, and
therefore referred to the ultimate
end of man, but when it is given alone
and for its own sake. We deny the
competency of the state to educate
even for its own order, its right to establish
purely secular schools, from which
all religion is excluded, as Mr. Webster
ably contended in his argument
in the Girard will case; but we do
not deny, we assert rather, its right to
establish public schools under the internal
control and management of
the spiritual society, and to exact
that a certain amount of secular instruction
be given along with the religious
education that society gives.
This last right it has in consideration
of the secular funds for the support
of the schools it furnishes, and as
a condition on which it furnishes
them.</p>

<p>Let the state say distinctly how
much secular education in the public
schools it exacts, or judges to be necessary
for its own ends, and so far
as the Catholic Church has anything
to do with the matter it can have it.
The church will not refuse to give it
in the schools under her control. She
will not hesitate to teach along with
her religion any amount of reading,
writing, arithmetic, history, geography,
music, and drawing, or the sciences
and the fine arts, the state exacts
and provides for; nor will she
refuse to allow it to send, if it chooses,
its own inspectors into her schools
to ascertain if she actually gives the
secular education required. Let it
say, then, what amount of secular
education it wants for all the children
of the land, and is willing to pay
for, and, so far as Catholics are concerned,
it can have it, and of as
good quality, to say the least, as it
can get in purely secular schools, and
along with it the religious education,
the most essential to it as well as to
the souls of all.</p>

<p>But the difficulty here, it is assumed,
is that the spiritual society
with us is divided into various denominations,
each with its distinctive
views of religion. That, no doubt,
is a damage, but can be easily overcome
by bearing in mind that the
several divisions have equal rights,
and by making the public schools
denominational, as they are in Prussia,
Austria, France, and to a certain
extent in England, where denominational
diversities obtain as well as
with us. Where the community is
divided between different religious
denominations, all standing on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
footing of perfect equality before
civil society, this is the only equitable
system of public schools that is practicable.
If the state does not adopt
it, it must&mdash;1, let the whole business
of education alone, and make no
public provision for it; 2, establish
purely secular, that is, godless schools,
from which all religion is excluded,
to which no religious people can be
expected to consent, and which would
ruin both public and private virtue,
and defeat the very purpose of all
education; or, 3, it must practically,
if not theoretically, recognize some
one of the several denominations as
the state religion, and remit the education
of childhood and youth to
its management and control, as is
virtually the case with our present
public schools, but which would be
manifestly unjust to all the others&mdash;to
non-evangelicals, if evangelicalism is
made the state religion, or to the
Evangelicals, if a non-evangelical
denomination be established as the
religion of the state. The only way
to be just to all is, as everybody can
see, to recognize in practice as well
as in profession the equal rights of
all denominations in the civil order&mdash;make
the public schools denominational,
and give to each denomination
that asks it for the sake of conscience
its fair and honest proportion,
to be as to their internal economy,
education, and discipline under its
sole control and management.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson proposes for our admiration
and imitation the Prussian system
of public schools, and though
we do not know that it is superior to
the Austrian or even the French system,
yet we think highly of it. But,
what the Evangelical senator does
not tell us, the Prussian system is
strictly the denominational system,
and each denomination is free and
expected to educate in its own schools
its own children, under the direction
of its pastors and teachers, in its own
religion. The Prussian system recognizes
the fact that different communions
do exist among the Prussian
people, and does not aim to suppress
them or at unification by state
authority. It meets the fact as it is,
without seeking to alter it. Give us
the Prussian system of denominational
schools, and we shall be satisfied,
even if education is made compulsory.
We, of course, protest against any law
compelling us to send our children to
schools in which our religion cannot
be freely taught, in which no religion
is taught, or in which is taught in any
shape or degree a religion which we
hold to be false or perilous to souls.
Such a law would violate the rights
of parents and the freedom of conscience;
but with denominational
schools compulsory education would
violate no one's conscience and no
parental right. Parents ought, if
able, to have their children educated,
and if they will not send their children
to schools provided for them by
the public, and in which their religion
is respected, and made the basis of
the education given, we can see no
valid reason why the law should not
compel them. The state has the
right, perhaps the duty, in aid of the
spiritual society and for its own safety
and the public good, to compel
parents to educate their children
when public schools of their own religion,
under the charge of their own
pastors, are provided for them at the
public expense. Let the public schools
be denominational, give us our proportion
of them, so that no violence
will be done to parental rights or to
the Catholic conscience, and we shall
be quite willing to have education
made compulsory, and even if such
schools are made national, though
we should object as American citizens
to them, we should as Catholics accept
them. We hold state authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
is the only constitutional authority under
our system to establish schools and
provide for them at the public expense;
but we could manage to get
along with national denominational
schools as well as others could. We
could educate in our share of the
public schools our own children in our
own way, and that is all we ask. We
do not ask to educate the children
of others, unless with the consent or
at the request of parents and guardians.</p>

<p>The Prussian system of denominational
schools could be introduced
and established in all the states without
the least difficulty, if it were not
for Evangelicals, their Unitarian offshoots,
and their humanitarian allies.
These are religious and philanthropic
busybodies, who fancy they are the Atlas
who upholds the world, and that
they are deputed to take charge of
everybody's affairs, and put them to
rights. But they forget that their neighbors
have rights as well as themselves,
and perhaps intentions as honest and
enlightened, and as much real wisdom
and practical sagacity. The
only obstacle to the introduction and
establishment of a just and equitable
system of public schools comes from
the intolerant zeal of these Evangelicals,
who seek to make the public
schools an instrument for securing the
national, social, and religious unification
they are resolved on effecting, and
for carrying out their purpose of suppressing
the church and extirpating
Catholicity from American soil.
They want to use them in training our
children up in the way of Evangelicalism,
and moulding the whole
American population into one homogeneous
people, modelled, as we have
said, after the New England Evangelical
type. Here is the difficulty,
and the whole difficulty. The denominational
system would defeat
their darling hope, their pet project,
and require them to live and let live.
They talk much about freedom of
conscience and religious liberty and
equal rights; but the only equal
rights they understand are all on their
side, and they cherish such a tender
regard for religious liberty, have so
profound a respect for it, that they
insist, like our Puritan forefathers, on
keeping it all to themselves, and not
to suffer it to be profaned or abused
by being extended to others.</p>

<p>Prussia, though a Protestant country,
does not dream of making the
public schools a machine either for
proselytism or unification. She is
contented to recognize Catholics as
an integral part of her population,
and to leave them to profess and
practise their own religion according
to the law of their church. Our
Evangelicals would do well to imitate
her example. We Catholics are
here, and here we intend to remain.
We have as much right to be here as
Evangelicals have. We are too many
to be massacred or exiled, and too
important and influential a portion
of the American people to be of
no account in the settlement of
public affairs. We have votes, and
they will count on whichever side
we cast them; and we cannot reasonably
be expected to cast them on the
side of any party that is seeking to
use its power as a political party to
suppress our church and our religion,
or even to destroy our federative
system of government, and to leave
all minorities at the mercy of the irresponsible
majority for the time,
with no other limit to its power than it
sees proper to impose on itself; for
we love liberty, and our church teaches
us to be loyal to the constitution
of our country.</p>

<p>The wisest course, since there are
different religious denominations in
the country, is to accept the situation,
to recognize the fact, acquiesce in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
and make the best of it. Any attempt
to unmake, by the direct or indirect
authority of the state, Catholics of
their faith or any denomination of its
belief, is sure to fail. Each denomination
is free to use Scripture and
reason, logic and tradition, all moral
and intellectual weapons, against
its rivals, and with that it should be
contented. Whatever may be the
rightful claims of the church in the
theological order, she is contented
with the civil protection of her
equal rights in the political order.
She asks&mdash;with the wealth, the fashion,
the public opinion, the press, nine-tenths
of the population of the
country, and the seductions of the
world against her&mdash;only "an open
field and fair play." If she does not
complain, her enemies ought to be
satisfied with the advantages they
have.</p>

<p>We have entered our protest
against a party programme which
threatens alike the genius of the
American government and the freedom
of religion, for so much was obviously
our duty, both as Catholics and
citizens. We are aware of the odds
against us, but we have confidence
in our countrymen that, though they
may be momentarily deceived or
misled, they will, when the real character
of the programme we have exposed
is once laid open to them, reject
it with scorn and indignation,
and hasten to do us justice.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF YORKE.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER I.<br />

GENEALOGIES.</h3>

<p>Under a thickly-branched tree in
the northern part of one of the southern
counties of Maine is a certain
gray rock, matted over with dim
green lichens that are spotted with
dead gold. From under this rock
springs a sparkling little stream. It
is no storied fountain, rich with legends
of splendor, poetry, and crime,
but a dear, bright little Yankee brook,
with the world all before it. That
world it immediately proceeds to investigate.
It creeps through thready
grasses and russet pine-needles; it
turns aside, with great respect, for a
stone no larger than a rabbit; and
when a glistening pitchy cone drops
into it, the infant river labors under
the burden. When the thirsty fawn
comes there to drink, nearly the
whole rivulet flows down its throat,
and the cone is stranded high and
dry; what there is left flows southward.
A sunbeam pierces the scented
gloom, creeps down a tree-trunk,
steals over a knoll of green-and-brown
tree-moss, which then looks
like a tiny forest on fire, over yellow
violets, which dissolve in its light,
over a bank of rich dark mould veined
with the golden powder of decayed
pine-trees, moist and soft, and
full of glistening white roots, where
the flowers push down their pearly
feet. Over the bank, into the water,
goes the sunbeam, and the two
frolic together, and the stream dives
under the gnarled roots, so that its playmate
would believe it lost but for
that gurgle of laughter down in the
cool, fresh dark. Then it leaps up,
and spreads itself out in a mirror,
and the elder-tree, leaning over to
look at the reflection of its fan-like
leaves and clusters of white flowers,
gets very erroneous ideas concerning
its own personal appearance; for the
palpitating rings that chase each
other over the surface of the water
make the brown stems crinkle, the
leaves come to pieces and unite
again, and the many flowers in each
round cluster melt all together, then
twinkle out individually, only to melt
again into that bloomy full moon.
Over this shimmer of flowers and
water big bees fly, buzzing terribly,
dragon-flies dart, or hang, purple-mailed,
glittering creatures, with gauzy
wings, and comical insects dance
there, throwing spots of sunshine instead
of shadow down to the leafy
bed. Then the brook flows awhile
in a green tranquil shadow, till, reaching
the interlaced roots of two immense
trees that hold a bank between
them, it makes a sudden, foamy
plunge the height of a stag's front.
She is a bride then, you may say&mdash;she
is Undine, looking through that
white veil, and thinking new thoughts.</p>

<p>Now the bear comes down to
drink and look at his ugly face in
the deepening wave, foxes switch
their long tails about the banks, deer
come, as light-footed as shadows,
drink, and fling up their short tails,
with a flit of white, and trot away
with a little sniff, and their heads
thrown back, hearing the howl or
the long stride of the wolf in pursuit.
Rabbits come there, and squirrels leap
and nibble in the branches above.
Besides, there are shoals of pretty,
slim fishes.</p>

<p>So through the mellow gloom and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sunny sparkle of the old forest, the
clear brook wanders, growing wiser,
and talking to itself about many
things.</p>

<p>Presently the wild creatures withdraw,
sunburnt children wade across
from bank to bank, grassy clearings
abound, there are farm-houses, and
cows with tinkling bells; and then
comes a bridge, and boats dance upon
the water, and the stream is a river!
Alas for the Indian name it brought
up out of the earth with it, and lisped
and gurgled and laughed to itself
all the way down&mdash;the name spiked
with <i>k</i>'s and choky-looking <i>gh</i>'s,
rough to the eye, but sweet in the
mouth, like a hazel-nut in the burr.
The white settlers have changed all
that.</p>

<p>Now, indeed, the young river puts
on state, and lets people see that it
is not to be waded through; and
when they build a dam across, it
flows grandly over, in a smooth,
wine-colored curve. Times are changed,
indeed, since the little gray birds
with speckled breasts looked with admiration
at its first cascade, since the
bear, setting down his great paw,
clumsily splashed the whole stream
up over his shaggy leg. There are
farms to keep up appearances before,
mill-wheels to turn, and ships to bear
up. Pine-cones, indeed! Besides,
a new and strange experience has
come to it, and its bosom pulses daily
with the swelling of the tides. And
here one village street, with white
houses, follows its course a mile or
so, and another street with white
houses comes down to its bank from
the west, crosses over, and goes up
eastward. This town, with its two
principal streets forming a cross near
the mouth of the river, a white cross
at the end of a silver chain&mdash;shall
we call it Seaton? It is a good
enough name. And the river shall
be Seaton River, and the bay into
which it flows shall be Seaton Bay.
But the ocean that makes the bay,
and drinks the river, shall be Atlantic
still.</p>

<p>We have spoken!</p>

<p>We follow the road that follows
the stream on its eastern bank, cross
West Street, get into a poor, dwindling
neighborhood, leave the houses
nearly all behind, go over two small,
ill-conditioned hills, and find at our
right a ship-yard with wharves, at
our left a dingy little cottage, shaped
like a travelling-trunk, and not much
larger than some. It stands with its
side toward the dusty road, a large,
low chimney rises from the roof, there
is a door with a window at each side
of it. One can see at a glance from
the outside how this house is divided.
It has but two rooms below, with a
tiny square entry between, and a low
attic above. Each room has three
windows, one on each of the three
outer walls.</p>

<p>The kitchen looked toward the village
through its north window. Opposite
that was a large fireplace with
an ill-tempered, crackling fire of
spruce-wood, throwing out sparks
and splinters. It was April weather,
and not very warm yet. In the
chimney-corner sat Mr. Rowan, sulkily
smoking his pipe, his eyes fixed
on the chimney-back. He was a
large, slouching man, with an intelligent
face brutalized by intemperance.
Drunkard was written all over him,
in the scorched black hair, not yet
turning gray, in the dry lips, bloated
features, and inflamed eyes. He sat
in his shirt-sleeves, waiting impatiently
while his wife put a patch in his
one coat. Mrs. Rowan, a poor, faded,
little frightened woman, whom her
female acquaintances called "slack,"
sat near the south window, wrinkling
her brows anxiously over the said
patch, which was smaller than the
hole it was destined to fill. The afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
sunshine spread a golden
carpet close to her feet. In the light
of it one could see the splinters in
the much-scoured floor, and a few
fraggles in the hem of Mrs. Rowan's
calico gown.</p>

<p>At the eastern window sat Edith
Yorke, eleven years of age, with a
large book on her knees. Over this
book, some illustrated work on natural
history, she had been bending for
an hour, her loose mop of tawny
hair falling each side of the page.
So cloistered, her profile was invisible;
but, standing in front of her,
one could see an oval face with regular
features full of calm earnestness.
Bright, arched lips, and a spirited
curve in the nostrils, saved this face
from the cold look which regular
features often give. The large, drooping
eyelids promised large eyes, the
forehead was wide and not high, the
brows long, slightly arched, and pale-brown
in color, and the whole face,
neck, hands, and wrists were tanned
to a light quadroon tint. But where
the coarse sleeve had slipped up was
visible an arm of dazzling whiteness.
Outside the window, and but two
rods distant, hung a crumbling clay
bank, higher than the house, with a
group of frightened alder-bushes looking
over the top, and holding on
with all their roots. Some day, in
spite of their grip&mdash;the sooner, perhaps,
because of its stress&mdash;the last
frail hold was to be loosed, and the
bushes were to come sliding down
the bank, faster and faster, to pitch
headlong into the mire at the bottom,
with a weak crackling of all their
poor doomed branches.</p>

<p>Presently the child looked up, with
lights coming and going in her agate-colored
eyes. "How wonderful frogs
are!" she exclaimed involuntarily.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<p>She glanced at her two companions,
scarcely conscious of them, her
mind full of something else. "But
everything is wonderful, when you
come to think of it," she pursued
dreamily.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowan took the pipe from
his mouth, turned his forbidding face,
and glowered at the girl. "You're
a wonderful fool!" he growled; then
resumed his pipe, feeling better, apparently,
for that expression of opinion.
His wife glanced up, furtive
and frightened, but said nothing.</p>

<p>Edith looked at the man unmoved,
saw him an instant, then, still looking,
saw him not. After a while she
became aware, roused herself, and
bent again over the book. Then
there was silence, broken only by
the snapping of the fire, the snip of
Mrs. Rowan's scissors, and the lame,
one-sided ticking of an old-fashioned
clock on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>After a while, as the child read, a
new thought struck up. "That's
just like! Don't you think"&mdash;addressing
the company&mdash;"Major
Cleaveland said yesterday that I had
lightning-bugs in my eyes!"</p>

<p>Without removing his pipe, Mr.
Rowan darted an angry look at his
wife, whose face became still more
frightened. "Dear me!" she said
feebly, "that child is an idjut!"</p>

<p>This time the long, fading gaze
dwelt on the woman before it went
back to the book again. But the
child was too closely ensphered in
her own life to be much, if at all,
hurt. Besides, she was none of
theirs, nor of their kind. Her soul
was no dying spark struggling through
ashes, but a fire, "alive, and alive
like to be," as children say when
they wave the fire-brand, winding
live ribbons in the air; and no drop
of their blood flowed in her veins.</p>

<p>The clock limped over ten minutes
more, and the patch was got into its
place, after a fashion, botched somewhat,
with the knots on the outside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Mr. Rowan took the coat, grumbled
at it, put it on, and went out, glancing
back at the child as he opened
the door. She was looking after him
with an expression which he interpreted
to mean aversion and contempt.
Perhaps he mistook. May
be she was wondering at him, what
sort of strange being he was. Edith
Yorke was very curious regarding
the world she had got into. It seemed
to her a queer place, and that
she had at present not much concern
in it.</p>

<p>Her husband out of the way, Mrs.
Rowan took her knitting-work, and
stood a moment at the north window,
gazing up toward the town,
with a far-away look of blunted expectancy,
as if she had got in the
habit of looking for help which never
came. Then she drew a long sigh,
that also a habit, and, resuming her
chair, began to knit and to rock herself,
letting her mind, what there was
left of it, swing to and fro, unmeaningly
and miserably, to the sound of
the clock as it ticked. "O dear!
O dear!"&mdash;that was what the ticking
always said to this poor soul. As
she sat, the afternoon sun, sinking
lower, crept about her feet, climbed
to her lap, got hold of her knitting,
and ran in little bright flashes along
the needles, and snapped off in
sparks at the ends, so that she seemed
to be knitting sunshine.</p>

<p>This woman was what remained
at forty of a pretty, flaxen-haired girl
of eighteen, who had captivated handsome
Dick Rowan, for he had been
handsome. A faded rag of a woman
she was, without hope or spirit,
all the color and life washed out of
her in a bitter rain of tears. The
pink cheeks had faded, and only the
ghost remained of that dimple that
had once seemed to give meaning
to her smiles. The curly hair was
dry and thin, and had an air of chronic
untidiness. The blue-gray eyes
were dim and heavy, the teeth were
nearly all gone. The pretty, chirping
ways that had been captivating
when youth covered their silliness&mdash;oh!
where had they gone? She was
a weak, broken-hearted, shiftless little
woman, and her husband hated her.
He felt wronged and cheated by her.
He was more disappointed than Ixion,
for in this cloud there had never
even been a goddess. If she had
sometimes turned upon him, when he
acted like a brute, and scorned him
for it, he would have liked her better;
but she shrank, and cowered,
and trembled, made him feel himself
ten times the brute she dared not
call him, yet gave him nothing to
resent. "Gentle, is she?" he cried
out once in a rage. "She is not! She
is weak and slavish. A person cannot
be gentle who cannot be something
else."</p>

<p>So the poor woman suffered, and
got neither pity nor credit from the
one who caused her suffering. It
was hard; and yet, she was nobler in
her misery than she would have been
in happiness. For sorrow gave her
now and then a touch of dignity;
and when, stung with a sudden perception
of her own nothingness, she
flung her desperate hands upward,
and called upon God to deliver her,
a certain tragical power and beauty
seemed to wrap her round. Mrs.
Rowan happy would have been a
trivial woman, meaning no great
harm, because meaning no great anything;
but the fiery furnace of pain
had scorched her up, and what remained
was pure.</p>

<p>When the two were alone, Edith
dropped her book, and looked across
the room at her companion. Mrs.
Rowan, busy with her own sad
thoughts, took no notice of her, and
presently the child glanced past her,
and out the window. The view was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not bad. First came the dusty road,
then the ship-yard, then the river
sparkling, but rather the worse for
sawdust and lath-edgings that came
down from the lumber-mills above
the village. But here all that was
sordid came to an end. The meanness
and misery on the hitherward
bank were like witches, who cannot
cross running water. From the opposite
bank rose a long, grassy hill,
unmarred by road or fence. In summer-time
you could see from far away
the pinkness of the wild-roses that
had seen fit to bind with a blooming
cestus the dented waist of this hill.
Behind them was a green spray of locust
and laburnum trees, then dense
round tops of maples, and elms in
graceful groups, half-hiding the roofs
and gables of Major Cleaveland's
house&mdash;the great house of the village,
as its owner was the great man. Behind
that was a narrow rim of pines
and spruces, making the profile of an
enchanted city against the horizon,
and above that a vast hollow of unobstructed
sky. In that space the
sunsets used to build their jasper
walls, and calm airs stretch long lines
of vapor across, till the whole west was
a stringed instrument whereon a full
symphony of colors played good-night
to the sun. There the west
wind blew up bubbles of wry cloud,
and the new moon put forth her
gleaming sickle to gather in the sheaf
of days, a never-failing harvest,
through storm and sunshine, hoar-frost
and dew. There the pearly piles
of cumuli used to slumber on summer
afternoons, lightnings growing in their
bosoms to flash forth at evening; and
there, when a long storm ended with
the day, rose the solid arch of cerulean
blue. When it had reached a
certain height, Edith Yorke would
run into the south room, and look
out to see the rainbow suspend its
miraculous arch over the retreating
storm. This little girl, to whom
everything was so wonderful when
she came to think of it, was a dear
lover of beauty.</p>

<p>"O dear! O dear!" ticked the
clock; and the barred sunshine turned
slowly on the floor, as if the ugly
little house were the hub of a huge,
leisurely wheel of gold.</p>

<p>Edith dropped her book, and went
to Mrs. Rowan's side, taking a stool
with her, and sitting down in the
midst of the sunshine.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I shall forget my story,
Mrs. Jane, unless I say it over
again," she said. "And, you know,
mamma told me never to forget."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan roused herself, glad
of anything which could take her
mind from her own troubles. "Well,
tell it all over to me now," she said.
"I haven't heard it this long time."</p>

<p>"Will you be sure to correct me if
I am wrong?" the child asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will. But don't begin till
I have taken up the heel of this stocking."</p>

<p>The stitches were counted and
evened, half of them taken off on to a
thread, and the other half, with the
seam-stitch in the middle, knit backward
once. Then Edith began to
repeat the story confided to her by
her dead mother.</p>

<p>"My grandpapa and grandmamma
were Polish exiles. They had to
leave Poland when Aunt Marie was
only a year old, and before mamma
was born. They couldn't take their
property with them, but only jewels,
and plate, and pictures. They went
to Brussels, and there my mamma was
born, and the queen was her godmother,
and sent the christening-robe.
Mamma kept the robe till she grew
up; but when she was in America, and
was poor, and wanted to go to a party,
she cut it up to make the waist
and sleeves of a dress. Poverty is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
no disgrace, mamma said, but it is a
great inconvenience. By-and-by,
they left Brussels, and went to England.
Grandpapa wanted some way
to get money to live on, for they had
sold nearly all their pictures and
things. They stayed in England not
very long. Countess Poniatowski called
on grandmamma, and she had on a
black velvet bonnet with red roses in
it; so I suppose it was winter. Then
one day grandpapa took mamma out
to walk in a park; so I suppose that
was summer. There were some gentlemen
in the park that they talked
to, and one of them, a gentleman with
a hook nose, who was sitting down
on a bench, took mamma on his knees,
and started to kiss her. But mamma
slapped his face. She said he had no
right to kiss people who didn't want
him to, not even if he were a king.
His name was the Duke of Wellington.
Then they all came to America,
and people here were very polite
to them, because they were Polish
exiles, and of noble birth. But they
couldn't eat nor drink nor wear
politeness, mamma said, and so
they grew poorer and poorer every
day, and didn't know what they
would do. Once they travelled with
Henry Clay two weeks, and had
quite a nice time, and they went to
Ashland and stayed all night. When
they went away the next day, Mr.
Clay gave mamma and Aunt Marie the
little mugs they had had to drink out of.
But they didn't care much about 'em,
and they broke 'em pretty soon. Mamma
said she didn't know then that Mr.
Clay was a great man. She thought
that just a mister couldn't be great.
She had always seen lords and counts,
and grandpapa was a colonel in the
army&mdash;Colonel Lubomirski his name
was. But she said that in this country
a man might be great, even if he
wasn't anything but a mister, and
that my papa was as great as a
prince. Well, then they came to
Boston, and Aunt Marie died, and
they buried her, and mamma was almost
nine years old. People used to
pet and notice her, and everybody
talked about her hair. It was thick
and black, and it curled down to her
waist. One day Doctor Somebody,
I can never recollect his name, took
her out walking on the Common,
and they went into Mr. John Quincy
Adams's house. And Mr. Adams
took one of mamma's curls, and held
it out, and said it was long enough
and large enough to hang the Czar
with. And she said that they might
have it all if they'd hang him with
it. And then poor grandpapa had
to go to Washington, and teach dancing
and fencing, because that was all
he could do. And pretty soon grandmamma
broke her heart and died.
And then after a little while grandpapa
died. And, after that, mamma
had to go out sewing to support
herself, and she went to Boston, and
sewed in Mr. Yorke's family. And
Mr. Yorke's youngest brother fell in
love with her, and she fell in love
with him, and they married each
other in spite of everybody. So the
family were awfully angry. My papa
had been engaged ever since he was
a little boy to Miss Alice Mills, and
they had put off getting married because
she was rich, and he hadn't
anything, and was looking round to
see how he should get a fortune.
And the Millses all turned against him,
and the Yorkes all turned against
him, and he and mamma went off, and
wandered about, and came down to
Maine; and papa died. Then mamma
had to sew again to support herself,
and we were awfully poor. I
remember that we lived in the same
house with you; but it was a better
house than this, and was up in
the village. Then mamma's heart
broke, and she died too. But I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
mean to break my heart, Mrs. Jane.
It's a poor thing to do."</p>

<p>"Yes!" sighed the listener; "it's
a poor thing to do."</p>

<p>"Well," resumed the child, "then
you kept me. It was four years ago
when my mamma died, but I remember
it all. She made me promise
not to forget who my mother was,
and promise, with both my hands
held up, that I would be a Catholic,
if I had to die for it. So I held up
both my hands, and promised, and
she looked at me, and then shut her
eyes. It that all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear!" Mrs. Rowan had
dropped her knitting as the story
went on, and was gazing dreamily
out the window, recalling to mind
her brief acquaintance with the fair
young exile.</p>

<p>"Dick and I grew to be great
friends," Edith continued rather timidly.
"He used to take care of me,
and fight for me. Poor Dick! He
was mad nearly all the time, because
his father drank rum, and because
people twitted him, and looked down
upon him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan took up her work
again, and knit tears in with the
yarn.</p>

<p>"And Dick gave his father an awful
talking-to, one day," Edith went
on, still more timidly. "That was
two years ago. He stood up and
poured out words. His eyes were
so flashing that they dazzled, and his
cheeks were red, and he clinched his
hands. He looked most splendid.
When I go back to Poland, he shall
be a general in the army. He will
look just as he did then, if the Czar
should come near us. Well, after
that day he went off to sea, and he
has not been back since."</p>

<p>Tears were running down the mother's
cheeks as she thought of her
son, the only child left her of three.</p>

<p>Edith leaned and clasped both
her hands around Mrs. Rowan's arm,
and laid her cheek to them. "But
he is coming back rich, he said he
would; and what Dick said he'd do
he always did. He is going to take
us away from here, and get a pretty
house, and come and live with us."</p>

<p>A hysterical, half-laughing sob
broke through the listener's quiet
weeping. "He always did keep his
word, Edith!" she cried. "Dick was
a gallant lad. And I trust that the
Lord will bring him back to me."</p>

<p>"Oh! he'll come back," said Edith
confidently, and with a slight air of
haughtiness. "He'll come back himself."</p>

<p>All the Christianity the child had
seen had been such as to make the
name of the Lord excite in her heart a
feeling of antagonism. It is hard to believe
that God means love when man
means hate; and this child and her
protectors had seen but little of the
sunny side of humanity. Christians
held aloof from the drunkard and
his family, or approached them only
to exhort or denounce. That they
had any kinship with that miserable
man, that in his circumstances they
might have been what he was, never
seemed to occur to them as possible.
Dick fought with the boys who mocked
his father, therefore he was a bad
boy. Mrs. Rowan flamed up, and
defended her husband, when the Rev.
Dr. Martin denounced him, therefore
she was almost as bad as he. So
shallow are most judgments, arraigning
effects without weighing causes.</p>

<p>Nor did Edith fare better at their
hands. She was to them a sort of
vagabond. Who believed the story
of her mother's romantic misfortunes?
She was some foreign adventuress,
most likely. Mr. Charles Yorke, whom
they respected, had married a native
of Seaton, and had two or three
times honored that town with a short
visit. They knew that he had cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
off his own brother for marrying this
child's mother. Therefore she had
no claim on their respect.</p>

<p>Moreover, some of the ladies for
whom young Mrs. Yorke had done
sewing had not the pleasantest of recollections
connected with her. A
poor person has no right to be proud
and high-spirited, and the widowed
exile was a very fiery woman. She
would not sit at table with their servants,
she would not be delighted
when they patronized her, and she
would not be grateful for the scanty
wages they gave her. She had even
dared to break out upon Mrs. Cleaveland
when that lady had sweetly requested
her to enter her house by
the side door, when she came to sew.
"In Poland a person like you would
scarcely have been allowed to tie
my mother's shoes!" she cried. The
lady answered suavely, "But we are
not in Poland, madam;" but she
never forgave the insolence&mdash;still
less because her husband laughed at
it, and rather liked Mrs. Yorke's
spirit.</p>

<p>These were the ladies whom Edith
had heard talk of religion; so she
lifted her head, dropped her eyelids,
and said defiantly, "Dick will come
home himself!"</p>

<p>"Not unless the Lord lets him
come," said the mother. "Oh! no
good will come to us except by him.
'<i>Unless the Lord build the house, they
labor in vain that build it: unless the
Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain
that keepeth it.</i>'"</p>

<p>"I don't think you have much to
thank him for," remarked the child
quietly.</p>

<p>"I will thank him!" the woman
cried out in a passion. "I will trust
him! He is all the hope I have!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, you may!" Edith said
soothingly. "Don't let's talk about
it any more. Give me the scissors,
and I'll cut the fraggles off the hem
of your gown. Suppose Dick should
come home all of a sudden, and find
us looking so! I hope he will let
us know, don't you? so that we can
put our best clothes on."</p>

<p>The best clothes in question were a
black bombazine gown and shawl,
and an old-fashioned crape bonnet
and veil, all sewed up and hidden
away under Edith's bed in the little
dark attic, lest Mr. Rowan, in one
of his drunken frenzies, should destroy
them. These articles were the
mourning which Mrs. Rowan had
worn seven years before, when her
last daughter died. With them was
another bag, belonging to Edith,
equally precious to its owner, but
from other reasons. There was a
scarlet merino cape, lined with silk
of the same color, both a little faded,
and a faded crape scarf that had
once been gorgeous with red and
gold. In the innermost fold of this
scarf, wrapped in tissue-paper, and
tucked inside an old kid glove of remarkable
smallness, were two locks
of hair&mdash;one a short, thick wave of
yellow-brown, the other a long, serpentine
tress of ebony blackness.</p>

<p>While they talked, the door of the
room opened, and Mr. Rowan looked
in. "Aren't we going to have any
supper to-night?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Edith fixed a look on him that
made him shrink out, and bang the
door behind him. His wife started
up, glanced at the clock, and went
about her work.</p>

<p>"Let me help you, Mrs. Jane,"
the child said.</p>

<p>"No, dear. There isn't much to
do, and I'd rather do it." Mrs.
Rowan's voice had a sepulchral sound,
her head being deep in the fireplace,
where she was putting one hook into
another on the crane, to let the tea-kettle
down. She emerged with a
smooch of soot on her hair and forehead,
and began flying round bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a table into the middle of the
floor, putting up the leaves, spreading
the cloth, taking down the dishes,
all with trembling haste. "If you
want to knit a few times across the
heel of that stocking, you may. But
be careful not to knit too tightly, as
you almost always do. You can begin
to narrow when it's two of your
forefingers long."</p>

<p>Edith took the knitting, and went
to her favorite chair in the back window.
The room had grown smoky
in consequence of Mrs. Rowan's piling
of soft wood on to the fire, and
hurrying about past the fireplace, so
she pushed up the window, and fastened
it with a wooden button fixed
there for the purpose. Then she began
to knit and think, and, forgetting
Mrs. Rowan's directions, pulled the
yarn so tightly over her fingers that
she worked a hard, stiff strip across
the heel, into which the looser knitting
puckered. The child was too
much absorbed to be aware of her
mistake, and it did not matter; for
that stocking was never to be finished.</p>

<p>While she dreamed there, a deeper
shadow than that of the clay bank
fell over her. She looked up with a
start, and saw Mr. Rowan standing
outside the window. He had placed
himself so as to avoid being seen by
any one in the room, and was just
turning his eyes away from her when
she caught sight of him.</p>

<p>"Lean out here!" he said. "I want
to speak to you."</p>

<p>She leaned out and waited.</p>

<p>"What makes you stare at me the
way you sometimes do?" he asked
angrily, but in a low voice, that his
wife might not hear. "Why don't
you say right out what you think?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what I do think,"
replied Edith, dropping her eyes.</p>

<p>"You think that I am a wretch!"
he exclaimed. "You think I am a
drunkard! You think I abuse my
wife!"</p>

<p>She neither answered nor looked up.</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then went
on fiercely. "If there is anything I
hate, it is to have people look at me
that way, and say nothing. If you
scold a man, it looks as if you thought
there was something in him that
could tell black from white; and if
you are impudent, you put yourself
a little in the wrong, and that helps
him. He isn't so much ashamed of
himself. But when you just look,
and say nothing, you shut him out.
It is as much as to tell him that
words would be thrown away on
him."</p>

<p>"But," Edith objected, much at a
loss, "if I answered you back, or
said what I thought, there would be
a quarrel right off."</p>

<p>"Did I fight when Dick gave me
such a hauling-over before he went
away?" the man questioned in a
rough tone that did not hide how
his voice broke, and his blood-shot
eyes filled up with tears. "Didn't I
hang my head, and take it like a
dog? He said I had acted like a
brute, but he didn't say I was one,
and he didn't say but I could be a
man yet, if I should try. Wasn't I
sober for three months after he went
away? Yes; and I would have kept
sober right on if I had had some one
to thorn and threaten me. But she
gave up, and did nothing but whimper,
and it maddened me. When I
ordered her to mix my rum for me,
she did it. I should have liked her
better if she had thrown it, tumbler
and all, into my face."</p>

<p>"You'd better not find fault with
her," said Edith. "She's a great
deal better than you are."</p>

<p>The child had a gentle, sincere
way of saying audacious things sometimes
that made one wonder if she
knew how audacious they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The man stared at her a moment;
then, looking away, answered without
any appearance of anger, "I suppose
she is; but I don't think much
of that kind of goodness when there's
a hard job to be done. You can't
lift rocks with straws. I'm sorry for
her; but, for all that, she aggravates
me, poor thing!"</p>

<p>He leaned back against the house,
with his hands in his pockets, and
stared at the clay bank before him.
Edith looked at him, but said nothing.
Presently he turned so suddenly
that she started. "Girl," he said,
"never do you ridicule a man who has
been drinking, no matter what he
does! You may hate him, or be
afraid of him, but never laugh at
him! You might as well look down
into hell and laugh! Do you know
what it is to be in the power of rum?
It is to have serpents twining round
you, and binding you hand and foot.
I've gone through the streets up there
with devils on my back, pushing me
down; wild beasts tearing my vitals;
reptiles crawling round me; the earth
rising up and quaking under my feet,
and a horror in my soul that no words
can describe, and the men and women
and children have laughed at me.
Perhaps they were such shallow fools
that they didn't know; but I tell you,
and you know now. Don't you ever
dare to laugh at a drunkard!"</p>

<p>"I never will!" Edith cried out,
in an agony of terror and pity. "O
you poor man! I didn't know it was
so awful. O you poor man!"</p>

<p>Mr. Rowan had stopped, gasping
for breath, and, with his patched
sleeve, wiped off the perspiration that
was streaming down his face. Edith
tore off her little calico apron with
such haste as to break the strings.
"Here, take this!" she said, reaching
it out to him.</p>

<p>He took it with a shaking hand,
and wiped his face again; wiped his
eyes again and again, breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you be saved?" she
asked, in a whisper. "Isn't there
any way for you to get out of it?"</p>

<p>"No!" he said, and gave her back
her apron. "No; and I wish that I
were dead!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that!" the child entreated.
"It is wicked; and perhaps
you will die if you say it."</p>

<p>The drunkard raised his trembling
hands, and looked upward. "I wish
to God that I were dead!" he repeated.</p>

<p>Edith shrank back into the room.
She was too much terrified to listen
to any more. But after a moment he
called her name, and she leaned out
again. His face was calmer, and his
voice more quiet. "Don't tell her
what I have been talking about," he
said, nodding toward the room. "I
would sooner tear my tongue out by
the roots than say anything to her."</p>

<p>"I won't tell," Edith promised.</p>

<p>"Supper's ready," Mrs. Rowan
announced, coming towards the window.
She had heard her husband's
voice in conversation with Edith, and
wondered greatly what was going
on.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowan turned away, with a
look of irritation, at sound of her
timid voice, walked round the house,
and came sulkily in to his supper.</p>

<p>Their meals had always been comfortless
and silent; but now Edith
tried to talk, at first with Mrs. Rowan;
but when she saw that the
woman's tremulous replies, as if she
did not dare to speak in her husband's
presence, were bringing an
uglier frown to this face, and that he
was changing from sullen to savage,
she addressed her remarks and questions
to him. Mr. Rowan was a
surveyor, and a good one, when he
was sober, and he was a man of some
general information and reading.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
When he could be got to talk, one
was surprised to find in him the ruins
of a gentleman. Now his answers
were surly enough, but they were intelligent,
and the child, no longer
looking at him from the outside,
questioned him fearlessly, and kept
up a sort of conversation till they rose
from table.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Rowan's custom to go
out immediately after supper, and not
come home till late in the evening,
when he would stagger in, sometimes
stupid, sometimes furious with liquor.
But to-night he lingered about when
he had left the table, lighted his pipe,
kicked the fire, wound up the clock,
and cursed it for stopping, and finally,
as if ashamed of the proposal even
while making it, said to Edith,
"Come, get the checker-board, and
see if you can beat me."</p>

<p>She was quick-witted enough, or
sensitive enough, not to show any
surprise, but quietly brought out the
board, and arranged the chairs and
stand. It was a square of board,
rough at the edges, planed on one
side, and marked off in checks with
red chalk. The men were bits of
tanned leather, one side white, the
other side black. She placed them,
smiled, and said, "Now, I'm ready!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan's cheeks began to redden
up with excitement as she went
about clearing the table, and washing
the dishes, but she said nothing. She
had even tact enough to go away
into the bedroom, when her work
was done, and leave the two to play
out their game unwatched. There she
sat in the falling dusk, her hands clasped
on her knees, listening to every sound,
expecting every moment to hear her
husband go out. The three curtains
in the room were rolled up to the
very tops of the windows, and, in their
places, three pictures seemed to hang
on the smoky walls, and illumine the
place. One was a high clay bank,
its raw front ruddy with evening
light, its top crowned with a bush
burning like that of Horeb. The
second was a hill covered with spruce-trees,
nothing else, from the little
cone, not a foot high, to the towering
spire that pierced the sky. Some
faint rose-reflections yet warmed their
sombre shadows, and each sharp top
was silvered with the coming moonlight.
The third window showed a
deserted ship-yard, with the skeleton
of a bark standing on the stocks. The
shining river beyond seemed to flow
through its ribs, and all about it the
ground was covered with bright yellow
chips and shavings. Above it, in
the tender green of the southwestern
sky, a cloud-bark freighted with crimson
light sailed off southward, losing
its treasure as it went. These strong,
rich lights, meeting and crossing in
the room, showed clearly the woman's
nervous face full of suspense, the very
attitude, too, showing suspense, as
she only half-sat on the side of the
bed, ready to start up at a sound.
After a while she got up softly, and
went to the fireplace to listen.
All was still in the other room,
but she heard distinctly the crackling
of the fire. What had come over
him? What did it mean?</p>

<p>Presently there was a slight movement,
and Edith's voice spoke out
brightly: "Oh! I've got another
king. Now I have a chance!"</p>

<p>The listener trembled with doubt
and fear. Her husband was actually
sitting at home, and playing checkers
with Edith, instead of going out to
get drunk! He could not mean to
go, or he would have gone at once.
She longed to go and assure herself,
to sit down in the room with him,
but could scarcely find courage to do
so. She held her breath as she went
toward the door, and her hand faltered
on the latch. But at last she summoned
resolution, and went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>The lamp was lighted, the checker-board
placed on the table beside it,
and the two were talking over the
slackening game. Edith had a good
head for a child of her age, but her
opponent was an excellent player,
and she could not interest him long.
She was trying every lure to keep
him, though, and made a new tack
as Mrs. Rowan came in, relating an
experience of her own, instead of
questioning him concerning his. "I
want to tell you something I saw last
night in my chamber," she said.</p>

<p>Edith's chamber was the little dark
attic, which was reached by a steep
stairway at one side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>"I was in bed, wide awake, and it
was pitch dark. You know you put
the cover over the skylight when it
rained, the other day, and it has not
been taken off. Well, instead of
shutting my eyes, I kept them wide
open, and looked straight into the
dark. I've heard that you can see
spirits so, and so I thought I might see
my mamma. Pretty soon there was
a great hole in the dark, like a whirlpool,
and after a minute there was a
little light down at the bottom of it.
I kept on looking, just as if I were
looking down into a deep well, and
then there came colors in clouds,
sailing about, just like clouds in the
sky. Some were red, others pink,
others blue, and all colors. Sometimes
there would be a pattern of
colors, just like figures in a carpet,
only they were blocks, not flowers.
I didn't dream it. I saw it as plainly
as I see the fire this minute. What
do you suppose it was, Mr. Rowan?"</p>

<p>He had listened with interest, and
did not appear to find anything surprising
in the recital.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about optics,"
he answered; "but I suppose
there is a scientific reason for this,
whether it is known or not. I've seen
those colors&mdash;that is, I did when I
was a child; and De Quincey, in his
<cite>Opium Confessions</cite>, tells the same
story. I don't believe that grown
people are likely to see them, for the
reason that they shut their eyes, and
their minds are more occupied. You
have to stare a good while into the
dark, and wait what comes, and not
think much of anything."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Edith. "But what do
you guess it is?"</p>

<p>Mr. Rowan leaned back in his
chair, with his hands clasped behind
his head, and considered the matter
a moment, some finer intelligence
than often showed there kindling behind
his bloated face.</p>

<p>"I should guess it might be this,"
he said. "Though the place appears
at first to be dark, there are really
some particles of light there. And
since there are too few of them to
keep up a connection in their perfect
state, they divide into their colors,
and make the clouds you saw. I don't
know why particles of light should
not separate, when they have a great
deal to do, and not much to do it
with. Air does."</p>

<p>"But what made them move?"
Edith asked. "They were never
still."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they were alive."</p>

<p>She stared, with scintillating eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowan gave a short, silent
laugh. He knew that the child was
only questioning in order to keep him.
"No reason why not," he said. "According
to Sir Humphry Davy, and
some other folks, I believe, heat isn't
caloric, but repulsive motion. It isn't
matter, but it moves, goes where nothing
else can, passes through stone
and iron, and can't be stopped, and
can't be seen. Now, a something
that is not matter, and yet is powerful
enough to overcome matter, must be
spirit. Heat is the soul of light; and
if heat is spirit, light is alive. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voilà
tout!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>He had forgotten himself a moment
in the pleasure of puzzling his
questioner; but catching his wife
looking at him with an expression of
astonishment, he came back to the
present. The smile died out of his
face, and the frown came back.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to play <i>solitaire</i>?"
Edith struck in desperately.</p>

<p>He made a slight motion of dissent,
but it was not decided; so she
brought out the pack of soiled cards,
and laid them before him. There
was a moment of hesitation, during
which the heart of the wife throbbed
tumultuously, and the nerves of the
child tingled with an excitement that
seemed to snap in sparks from her
eyes. Then he took the cards,
shuffled them, and began to play.
Mrs. Rowan opened a book, and,
holding it upside down, so as to hide
her face, cried quietly behind the
page. Her husband saw that she
was crying, cast a savage glance at
her, and seemed about to fling the
cards down; but Edith made some
remark on the game, leaned toward
him, and laid her head lightly on
his arm. It was the first time in all
their acquaintance that she had voluntarily
touched him. At the same
time she reached her foot, and pushed
Mrs. Rowan's under the table.
Mrs. Rowan dropped her book, turned
her face away quickly, and said,
with an effort of self-control rare for
her: "Why, it's nine o'clock! I'll
go to bed, I think; I'm tired."</p>

<p>Nobody answering, or objecting,
she went away, and left her husband
still over his cards.</p>

<p>"Isn't it about your bedtime?"
he said presently to Edith.</p>

<p>She got up slowly, unwilling to
go, yet not daring to stay. Oh! if
she were but wise enough to know
the best thing that could be said&mdash;something
which would strengthen
his resolution, and keep him in. It
was not yet too late for him to go out;
for, when every safe and pitiful door
is closed, and slumber seals all merciful
eyes, the beacon of the grog-shop
shines on through the night,
and tells that the way to perdition
still is open, and the eyes of the rum-seller
yet on the watch.</p>

<p>"How glad I shall be when Dick
comes home!" she said. "Then I
hope we can all go away from here,
and wipe out, and begin over."</p>

<p>She could not have said better,
but, if she had known, she could have
done better. What he needed was
not an appeal to his sentiments, but
physical help. Words make but little
impression on a man while the torments
of a burning, infernal thirst are
gnawing at his vitals. The drunkard's
body, already singed by the
near flames of the bottomless pit,
needed attending to at once; his soul
was crushed and helpless under the
ruins of it. If an older, wiser head
and hand had been there, started up
the failing fire, and made some strong,
bitter draught for him to drink, it
might have done good. But the child
did not know, and the sole help she
could give was an appeal to his
heart.</p>

<p>It is as true of the finest and loftiest
natures, as of the perverted, that
they cannot always conquer the evil
one by spiritual means alone. Only
spirits can do that. And often the
tempter must laugh to see the physical
needs, which were made to play
about our feet like children, unnoticed
when the soul speaks, starved till
they become demons whose clamorous
voices drown the spirit's fainting
cries.</p>

<p>But this man's demon was indulgence,
and not denial. He was not
hovering on the brink of ruin, he was
at the bottom, and striving to rise,
and he could not endure that any
eye should look upon his struggles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"D&mdash; you! will you go to bed?"
he cried out fiercely.</p>

<p>Edith started back, and, without
another word, climbed the narrow
stair to her attic. Before closing the
trap-door, she looked down once,
and saw Mr. Rowan tearing and twisting
the cards he had been playing
with.</p>

<p>He stayed there the whole night,
fighting desperately with such weapons
as he had&mdash;a will broken at the
hilt, the memory of his son, and the
thought of that dear little girl's tender
but ineffectual pity. As for God, he
no longer named him, save in imprecation.
The faith of his orphaned
childhood had gone long ago. The
glare of the world had scorched it up
before it had fairly taken root. That
there might be help and comfort in
the church of his fathers never entered
his mind. "Drink! drink!" that
was his sole thought. "If I only
had some opium!" he muttered, "or
a cup of strong black coffee! I wonder
if I could get either of 'em anywhere?"</p>

<p>The day was faintly dawning when
he staggered to the window, tore
down the paper curtain, and looked
out for some sign of life. At the wharf
opposite lay a vessel that had come up
the evening before, and he knew by
the smoke that the cook was getting
breakfast there.</p>

<p>"I'll go over and see if I can get
some coffee or opium," he muttered,
and pulled his hat on as he went out
the door.</p>

<p>"I'll ask for nothing but coffee or
opium," he protested to himself, as
he shut the door softly after him.</p>

<p>Alas! alas!</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.<br />

WIPING OUT, AND BEGINNING ANEW.</h3>

<p>The next morning was a gloomy
one for the two who had nursed that
trembling hope overnight, but they
did not say much about it. Mrs.
Rowan's face showed the lassitude of
long endurance. Edith's disappointment
was poignant. She was no
longer a looker-on merely, but an
actor. The man had confided in her,
had tacitly asked her sympathy, and
his failure gave her a pang. She
cast about in her thoughts what she
should do, having a mind to put her
own young shoulder to the wheel.
Should she go in search of him, and
give him one of those scoldings which
he had acknowledged his need of?
Should she lead him home, and protect
him from abuse?</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better go up to the
post-office?" she asked, after breakfast.
"I haven't been there this
good while, and there might be a letter
from Dick."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan hesitated: "Well,
yes." She disliked being left alone,
and she had no expectation of a letter.
But it seemed like slighting her
son to make any other reply to such
a request. Besides, the village boys
might be hooting her husband
through the streets, and, if they were,
she would like to know it. So Edith
prepared herself, and went out.</p>

<p>The ship-yard was full of business
at this hour, and two men were at
work close to the road, shaving a
piece of timber. Edith looked at
them, and hesitated. "I've a good
mind to," she thought. She had
never gone into the ship-yard when
the men were there, and had never
asked any one a question concerning
Mr. Rowan. But now all was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
changed, and she felt responsible.
"Have you seen Mr. Rowan anywhere,
this morning?" she asked,
going up to the man nearest her.</p>

<p>He drew the shave slowly to him,
slipped off a long curl of amber-colored
wood from the blade, then
looked up to see who spoke. "Mr.
Rowan!" he repeated, as if he had
never heard the name before. "Oh!
Dick, you mean. No, I haven't seen
him, this morning. He may be lying
round behind the timbers somewhere."</p>

<p>The child's eyes sparkled. Child
though she was, she knew that the
drunkard was more worthy of the
title of gentleman than this man was,
for he was rude and harsh only when
he suffered.</p>

<p>"Little girl," the other called out
as she turned away, "your father is
over there on board of the <i>Annie
Laurie</i>. I saw him lying there half
an hour ago, and I guess he hasn't
stirred since."</p>

<p>"He isn't my father!" she flashed
out.</p>

<p>The two burst into a rude laugh,
which effectually checked the thanks
she would have given for their information.
She turned hastily away,
and went up the road to the village.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan finished her work,
and sat down in the west window to
watch. She was too anxious and discouraged
to knit, even, and so did
not discover the tight little strip of
work around the stocking-heel. It
was employment enough to look out
for Edith; not that she expected a
letter, but because she wanted company.
She was conscious of some
strength in the child, on which she
leaned at times. As for Dick, she
had little hope of good news from
him, if any. She had no part in
Edith's rose-colored expectations.
Dick in peril from storm, foe, or sin;
Dick dying untended in foreign lands;
Dick sinking down in cold, salt seas&mdash;these
were the mother's fancies.</p>

<p>After half an hour, a small figure
appeared over the hills between the
house and the village. Mrs. Rowan
watched it absently, and with a slight
sense of relief. But soon she noticed
that the child was running. It was
not like Edith to run. She was
noticeably quiet, and even dignified
in her manners. Could she have
seen or heard anything of Mr. Rowan
at the village? The heart of the
wife began to flutter feebly. Was he
lying in the street? or engaged in a
drunken quarrel? She leaned back
in her chair, feeling sick, and tried to
gather strength for whatever might
come to her.</p>

<p>Edith was near the house, now
running a few steps, then walking, to
gather breath, and she held her arm
above her head, and swung it, and in
her hand was a letter!</p>

<p>Away went all thought of her husband.
In two minutes Mrs. Rowan
had the letter in her hand, had torn
it open, and she and Edith were both
bending over it, and reading it together.
It had been lying in the
post-office a week. It came from
New York, and in a week from the
date of it Dick would be at home!
He was on board the ship <i>Halcyon</i>,
Captain Cary, and they were to come
down to Seaton, and load with lumber
as soon as their East Indian freight
should be disposed of. He had met
Captain Cary in Calcutta, Dick
wrote, and, having done him a service
there, had been taken on board
his ship, and now was second mate.
Next voyage he would sail as first
mate. The captain was his friend,
would do anything for him, and owned
half the ship, Major Cleaveland
owning the other half; so Dick's fortune
was made. But, he added,
they must get out of that town. He
had a month to spare, and should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
take them all away. Let them be
ready to start on short notice.</p>

<p>Having read this joyful letter
through once, they began at the
first word and read it all through
again, dwelling here and there with
exclamations of delight, stopped every
minute by a large tear that splashed
down from Mrs. Rowan's eyes, or a
yellow avalanche of Edith's troublesome
hair tumbling down as she bent
eagerly over the letter. How many
times they read that letter would be
hard to say; still harder to say how
many times they might have read it,
had there been no interruption.</p>

<p>A crowd of men were approaching
their door&mdash;close upon them, and
darkening the light before they looked
up. "Had Dick come, and were
the neighbors welcoming him?" was
the first thought.</p>

<p>In her haste, Edith had left the
outer door ajar, and now heavy feet
came tramping in without any leave
being asked; the inner door was
pushed open, and&mdash;not Dick, but
Dick's father was brought in and
laid on the floor. This was not the
first time he had been brought home,
but never before had he come with
such a retinue and in such silence,
and never before had these men taken
off their hats to Mrs. Rowan.</p>

<p>"We've sent for the doctor, ma'am,"
one of them said; "but I guess it's
no use."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have ordered him off,
if I hadn't thought he was steady
enough to go," said another, who
looked very pale. "The captain
was expected on board every minute,
and it would be as much as my life
is worth if he found a man drunk
there."</p>

<p>"He slipped on a plank, and fell,"
some one explained.</p>

<p>Their talk was, to the bewildered
woman, like sounds heard in a dream.
So were Edith's passionate words as
she ordered the men away. The one
who had refused the dead man any
better title than "Dick" was just
coming in at the door, staring right
and left, not too pitiful even then to
be curious regarding the place he was
in. "Go out!" she said, pushing the
door in his face.</p>

<p>Some way, still in a dream, they
were got rid of, all but two. Then
the doctor came, and looked, and
nodded his decision&mdash;"All over!"</p>

<p>A dream! a dream!</p>

<p>The bedroom was set in order,
the silent sleeper laid out there, every
stranger sent out of the house and
locked out, and then Mrs. Rowan
woke up. It was a terrible awakening.</p>

<p>Madame Swetchine comments upon
the fact that the thought of death is
more terrible in an arid existence than
in the extremes of joy and sorrow. It
is true not only of those who die, but
of the survivors. We go out more
willingly on a difficult journey when
we have been warmed and fed; we
send our loved ones out with less
pain when they have been thus fortified.
It is the same, in a greater degree,
when the journey is that one
from which the traveller never returns.
It adds a terrible pang to bereavement
when we think that our lost
one has never been happy; how much
more terrible if he has never been
honored!</p>

<p>Of her husband's future Mrs.
Rowan refused to think or to hear,
though she must have trembled
in the shadow of it. It might be that
which made her so wild. She would
allow no one to come near or speak
to her save Edith. Those who came
with offers of help and sympathy she
ordered away. "Go!" she cried. "I
want nothing of you! I and mine
have been a byword to you for years.
Your help comes too late!"</p>

<p>She locked them out and pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the curtains close, and, though people
continued to come to the door through
the whole day, no one gained admittance
or saw a sign of life about the
house. Inside sat the widow and the
child, scarcely aware of the passage
of time. They only knew that it was
still day by the rays of sunlight that
came in through holes in the paper
curtains, and pointed across the rooms
like long fingers. When there was a
knock at the door, they started, lifted
their faces, and listened nervously till
the knocking ceased, as if afraid that
some one might force an entrance.
One would have fancied, from their
expression, that savages or wild beasts
were seeking to enter. They never
once looked out, nor knew who came.</p>

<p>Still less were they aware of Major
Cleaveland standing in his cupola,
spy-glass in hand, looking down the
bay to see if that cloud of canvas
coming up over the horizon was the
good ship <i>Halcyon</i> coming home after
her first voyage. Down-stairs he
came again, three stairs at a jump, as
joyful as a boy, in spite of his forty
years, gave directions for the best
dinner that the town would afford,
ordered his carriage, and drove off
down the river-road.</p>

<p>The <i>Halcyon</i> was the largest vessel
that had ever been built at Seaton,
and as its launching had been an
event in the town, so its first arrival
was an incident to take note of.
When Major Cleaveland drove down
to the wharf where Mr. Rowan had
that morning lost his life, more than
a hundred persons were assembled
there waiting for the ship, and others
were coming. He stepped over to
the Rowans' door, and knocked
twice, once with his knuckles, and
again with his whip-handle, but received
no answer. "I would force
the door, but that Dick is coming,"
he said. "It is a shame to let the
poor soul shut herself up alone."</p>

<p>Soon, while the crowd watched,
around the near curve of the river,
where a wooded point pushed out,
appeared the tip, then the whole of
a bowsprit garlanded with green
wreaths, then the leaning lady in her
gilded robes, with a bird just escaping
from her hand, then the ship rode
gracefully into sight on the incoming
tide.</p>

<p>A ringing shout welcomed her, and
a shout from all hands on board answered
back.</p>

<p>Foremost of the little group on the
deck stood a man of gigantic stature.
His hair was coarse and black, he
wore an enormous black beard, and
his face, though scarcely middle-aged,
was rough and scarred by the
weather. Everybody knew Captain
Cary, a sailor worthy of the old days
of the Vikings, broad-shouldered, as
strong as a lion, with a laugh that
made the glasses ring when he sat at
table. He was a plain, simple man,
but grand in his simplicity. By his
side stood a youth of twenty, who
looked slight in comparison, though
he was really manly and well grown.
He had sea-blue eyes, quick, long-lashed,
and as bright as diamonds;
his face was finely moulded, ruddy,
and spirited; his hair, that glistened
in the sunlight, was chestnut-brown.
A gallant lad he was, the very ideal
sailor-boy. But his expression was
defiant, rather than placid, and he
did not join in the hurrahs. The welcoming
applause was not for him, he
well knew. They were no friends of
his who crowded the wharf. He had
some bitter recollections of slight or
injury connected with nearly every
one of them. But he was no longer
in their power, and that gave him
freedom and ease in meeting them.
The time had gone by when he could
look upon these country folks as final
judges in any matter whatever, or as
of any great consequence to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
He had seen the world, had won
friends, had proved that he could do
something, that he was somebody.
He was not ashamed of himself by
any means, was young Dick Rowan.
Still, it was no pleasure to him to see
them, for it brought back the memory
of sufferings which had not yet lost
their sting.</p>

<p>All this shouting and rejoicing was
as the idle wind to the mourners
across the way. Their fears of intrusion
set at rest, since no one had
attempted to force an entrance to the
house, they no longer took notice
even of the knocking at the door.
Both had fallen into a sort of stupor,
induced by the exhaustion of long
weeping, the silence and semi-darkness
of their rooms, and the removal
of what had been the daily tormenting
fear of their lives. There was no
longer any need to tremble when a
step approached, lest some one should
come in frenzied with drink, and terrify
them with his ravings and violence.
Mrs. Rowan sat by her husband's
side, leaning back in her
chair, with closed eyes and clasped
hands, only half-alive. Edith lay on
the kitchen-floor, where she had
thrown herself in a passion of weeping,
her arms above her head, her
face hidden, and her long hair veiling
her. The weeping was over, and
she lay silent and motionless. Neither
that shouting over on the wharf, nor
Major Cleaveland's loud knocking
with his whip-handle, had made the
slightest impression on her.</p>

<p>But at sunset came one who would
not be denied. He tried the lock,
and, finding it fastened, knocked
gently. There was no answer. He
knocked loudly, and still there was
no reply. Then he set his knee
against the rickety panel, took the
knob in a strong grasp, and wrenched
the door open. Stepping quickly
into the little entry, he looked to right
and left, saw the girl lying, face down,
on the floor, and the woman sitting
beside her dead, both as still as the
dead.</p>

<p>Something like a dream came into
the half-swoon, half-sleep in which
Edith Yorke lay. She heard a slight
cry, then a stifled sob, and words
hurriedly spoken in a low voice.
Then there was a step that paused
near her. She put her hair back with
one hand, and turned her face listlessly.
The curtain had been raised
to let in the light, and there stood
a young man looking down at her.
His face was pale with the sudden
shock of grief and distress, but a faint
indication of a smile shone through
as she looked up at him.</p>

<p>Her first glance was a blank one,
her second flashed with delight. She
sprang up as if electrified. "O
Dick! O Dick! How glad I am!"</p>

<p>The world moved rightly at last!
Order was coming out of chaos; for
Dick had come home!</p>

<p>He shook hands with her rather
awkwardly, somewhat embarrassed
by the warmth of her welcome.
"We're to go right off," he said.
"Captain Cary will help us."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dick!" she replied, and
asked no questions. He knew what
was right. With him had come all
help, and strength, and hope.</p>

<p>The next morning, long before
dawn, they started. A boat was ready
at the wharf, and Captain Cary
and Dick carried out the dead in a
rude coffin that had been privately
made on board the <i>Halcyon</i>. "They
shall not stare at our poor funeral,
captain," Dick had said; "and I will
not ask them for a coffin or a grave."</p>

<p>"All right!" his friend had answered
heartily. "I'm your man.
Whatever you want to do, I'll help
you about."</p>

<p>So the watch on the <i>Halcyon</i> was
conveniently deaf and blind, the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was ready in the dark of morning,
the coffin carried out to it, and Mrs.
Rowan and Edith helped in after.
When they were in their places, and
the captain seated, oars in hand,
Dick went back to the house, and
stayed there a little while. No
questions were asked of him when
he came away, bringing nothing with
him, and he offered no explanation,
only took the oars, and silently guided
their boat out into the channel.
The banks on either side were a solid
blackness, and the sky was opaque
and low, so that their forms were
scarcely visible to each other as they
sat there, Mrs. Rowan in the bows
near her son, Edith beside Captain
Cary, who loomed above her like a
mountain of help.</p>

<p>Presently, as they floated around
the point that stood between the village
and the bay, a faint blush of
light warmed the darkness through,
and grew till the low-hung clouds
sucked it up like a sponge and showed
a crimson drapery over their heads.
It was too early for morning light,
too fierce, and, moreover, it came
from the wrong direction. The east
was before them; this sanguinary
aurora followed in their wake. It
shone angrily through the strip of
woods, and sent a long, swift beam
quivering over the water. This fiery
messenger shot like an arrow into
the boat, and reddened Mrs. Rowan's
hands, clasped on the edge of the
coffin. By the light of it, Dick
saw all their faces turned toward
him.</p>

<p>"The house was mine!" he said
defiantly.</p>

<p>The captain nodded approval, and
Edith leaned forward to whisper,
"Yes, Dick!" But Mrs. Rowan
said not a word, only sat looking
steadily backward, the light in her
face.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it!" sighed Edith to
herself. She had been thinking since
they left the house how people would
come and wander through it, and
peer at everything, and know just
how wretchedly they had lived. Now
they could not, for it would all be
burnt up. She sat and fancied the
fire catching here and there in their
poor little rooms, how the clock would
tick till the last minute, even when
its face was scorched and its glass
shivered, and then fall with a sudden
crash; how the flames would catch at
the bed on which the dead man had
lain, the mean paper curtains, the
chair she had sat in, Mrs. Rowan's
little rocking-chair, at the table where
they had sat through so many dreary
meals. The checker-board would
go, and the cards with which Mr.
Rowan had played the night before,
and the knitting-work with the puckered
heel, and her apron that the
drunkard had wiped his ghastly face
with. The shelves in the little closet
would heat, and blacken, and redden,
and flame, and down would come
their miserable store of dishes, rattling
into the yawning cellar. Fire
would gnaw at the ceiling, bite its
way into the attic, burn up her books,
creep to the bed where she had lain
and seen rainbow colors in the
dark, spread a sheet of flame over
the whole, rise, and burst through
the roof. She saw it all. She even
fancied that each long-used article
of their scanty plenishing, worn away
by human touch, constantly in the
sight of human eyes, would perish with
some human feeling, and send out a
sharp cry after them. The crackling
of flames was to her the cries of
burning wood. But she was glad of
it, for they were going to wipe out
and begin anew. There seemed to
her something very grand and exceedingly
proper in it all.</p>

<p>When their boat glided from the
river into the bay, others besides themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
became aware of the conflagration,
and the village bells rang
out a tardy alarm. Dick laughed
bitterly at the sound, but said nothing.</p>

<p>"They were sorry for you, Dick,"
the captain said. "I heard a good
many speak of it. They would have
been glad to do your family any kindness.
I don't blame you for coming
off; but you mustn't think there was
no kind feeling for you among the
folks there."</p>

<p>"Kindness may come too late, captain,"
the young man answered. "I
would have thanked them for it years
ago, when I had nowhere to turn to,
and hadn't a friend in the world; now
I don't thank them, and I don't want
their kindness. Even if I would take
it at last, neither they nor you have
any right to expect that I will run
to take the hand that has struck
me so many blows the first time it is
held out. I don't trust 'em. I want
proofs of good-will when I've had
proofs of ill-will."</p>

<p>"Dick is right, captain," his mother
interposed in a weary tone.
"You can't judge of such things if
you haven't felt them. It's easier to
hurt a sore heart than a sound one."</p>

<p>Within an hour they reached one
of those desolate little sandy islands
with which the bay was studded; and
now the faint spring dawn was breaking,
and the heavy masses of cloud lifting
and contracting, pale reaches of
sky visible between. By the cold glimmer
they scooped out a grave, and
placed the coffin in it. The water
washed the shore, and a chilly, sighing
wind came up from the east.</p>

<p>As the first shovelful of earth fell
on the coffin, Mrs. Rowan caught
back the captain's arm. "Don't cover
him out of sight without some
word spoken over him!" she implored.
"He was once young, and ambitious,
and kind, like you. He would
have been a man if he hadn't had
bad luck, and then got into bad company.
He was more wretched than
we were. O sir! don't cover him
out of sight as if he were a dog."</p>

<p>The sailor looked both pained and
embarrassed. "I'm not much used
to praying, ma'am," he said. "I'm a
Methodist, but I'm not a church-member.
If there was a Bible here, I
would read a chapter; but&mdash;there
isn't."</p>

<p>Dick walked off a little way, turned
his back, and stood looking at the
water. Mrs. Rowan, kneeling on the
sand-heap beside the grave, wept
loudly. "His father was a Catholic,"
she cried. "I don't think much
of Catholics; but, if poor Dick had
stood by his religion, he could have
had a priest to say some word over
him. I wouldn't have minded having
a priest here. He'd be better than
nobody."</p>

<p>Captain Cary was a strict Methodist,
and he felt that it would never
answer to have the absence of a Catholic
priest regretted. Something
must be done. "I could sing a
hymn, ma'am," he said hesitatingly;
and, as no one objected, he straightened
himself, dropped his spade,
and sang, to the tune of the "Dead
March in Saul,"</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Unveil thy bosom, faithful tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Take this new treasure to thy trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give these sacred relics room<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To slumber in the silent dust,"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>singing the hymn through.</p>

<p>In a confined place the sailor's
voice would have been too powerful,
and, perhaps, would have sounded
rough; but in open air, with no wall
nearer than the distant hills, no ceiling
but the sky, and with the complex
low harmony of the ocean bearing
it up and running through all its
pauses, it was magnificent. He sang
slowly and solemnly, his arms folded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
his face devoutly raised, and the
clouds seemed to part before his
voice.</p>

<p>When the hymn was ended, he
remained a moment without motion
or change of face, then stooped for
his shovel, and began to fill in the
grave.</p>

<p>While listening to him, Edith Yorke
had stood in a solemn trance, looking
far off seaward; but at sound of
the dropping gravel, her quiet broke
up, like ice in spring. She threw
her arm, and her loose hair with it,
up over her head, and sobbed behind
that veil. But her tears were not for
Mr. Rowan. Her soul had taken a
wider range, and, without herself being
aware of it, she was mourning for
all the dead that ever had died or
ever should die.</p>

<p>The first sunbeam that glanced
across the water showed a feather of
smoke from a steamer that came up
through the Narrows into the bay,
and the row-boat, a lessening speck,
making for the wharf. Twice a
week, passengers and freight were
taken and left at this wharf, three
miles below the town.</p>

<h2>SAUNTERING.</h2>


<p class="center">Saunterer (from <cite>Sainte Terre</cite>), a pilgrim to holy lands or places.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thoreau.</span></p>

<p>"They who never go to the Holy
Land in their walks are indeed mere
idlers and vagabonds; but they who
do go there are saunterers in the good
sense, such as I mean," says Thoreau.
I found the Holy Land in Paris, the
city of fashion and gaiety, and where
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le suprême bonheur</i> is said to be amusement.
Every church is a station of
the divine Passion, and to every votary
therein could I say:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"I behold in thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An image of him who died on the tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou also hast had thy crown of thorns."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Before these churches, consecrated
to some sweet mystery of the Gospel
or bearing the hallowed names of
those who had put on the sacred
stole of Christ's sufferings, I always
stopped. I was like Duke Richard,
in the <i>Roman du Rau</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Whene'er an open church he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He entered in with fervent means<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To offer up his orisons;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the doors were closed each one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knelt upon the threshold stone."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And one might well kneel upon the
threshold stone of these ancient
churches, feeding mind and soul
with sacred legends of the past embodying
holy truths which are depicted
on the outer walls, as at the
north door of Notre Dame de Paris,
the arch of which contains in many
compartments representations of a
diabolic pact and of a deliverance
effected by our potent Lady, which is
related in a metrical romance composed
by Ruteboef, in the time of
St. Louis. Saladin, a magician, wears
a cap of pyramidal form. And what
a mine of legendary and biblical lore
all over these venerable walls! Sermons
in stones come down to us
from the stonen saints in their niches
and the bas-reliefs which speak louder
than human tongues. The first stone
of this edifice was laid by Charlemagne,
and the last by Philip Augustus.
How much this fact alone tells!
And there is the Porte Rouge, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
exquisite specimen of the Gothic
style of the fifteenth century, the
expiatory monument of Jean-sans-Peur
after the assassination of the
Duke of Orleans. In the arch are
the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy,
in the attitude of supplication, one
on each side of our Saviour and the
Blessed Virgin. It is an eternal
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libera me de sanguinibus, Deus</i>.</p>

<p>And then the Portail du Milieu,
with the last judgment in the ogive,
the angels sounding the last trump,
the dead issuing forth from their
graves, the separation of the righteous
from the wicked, the great Judge
with the emblems of the crucifixion,
the Virgin and the loved apostle
John, and, finally, a glimpse of the
joys of heaven and the horrors of
hell. Yes, one could linger here for
days before this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Biblia pauperum</i>,
were there no more powerful attractions
within. And this is not the
only church the very exterior of
which is full of instruction.</p>

<p>In the porch of St. Germain de
l'Auxerrois is the statue of a maiden
holding in one hand a breviary and
in the other a lighted taper. By her
is a demon with a pair of bellows,
vainly trying to blow out the light&mdash;symbol
of faith and prayer. This is
the statue of one who deserves to be
ranked in history with Joan of Arc
on account of her heroism, for twice
she saved Paris by her courage and
her prayers. Would that she might
once more have intervened to save
the capital of fair France from the invader!
St. Genevieve is placed thus
at the entrance of the church of St.
Germain to remind us of his connection
with her history.</p>

<p>When St. Germain, Bishop of Auxerre,
and St. Lupus, the learned
Bishop of Troyes and the intimate
friend of Sidonius Apollinaris, were
on their way to Britain to combat the
heresy of Pelagianism, they passed
through the village now called Nanterre,
about two leagues from Paris.
All the inhabitants of the place
poured forth to meet them and obtain
their benediction. St. Germain
noticed in the crowd a little girl with
a face as radiant as an angel's. His
prophetic instinct told him she was
destined to be a chosen vessel of
God's grace, and, when she expressed
a wish to be the spouse of Christ, he
led her with him to the church, holding
his apostolic hands upon her head
during the chanting of the vesper service.
He afterward suspended a
bronze medal, on which was a cross,
from her neck, in remembrance of
her consecration to God, bidding her
henceforth give up all ornaments of
silver and gold. "Let them who
live for this world have these," said
he. "Do thou, who art become the
spouse of Christ, desire only spiritual
adorning." Dr. Newman says it was
a custom, even among the early
Christians, to wear on the neck some
token of the mysteries of their religion.
Long after, in memory of this
event, the Canons of St. Genevieve,
at Paris, distributed upon her festival
a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pain bénit</i> on which was an impression
of this coin.</p>

<p>Eighteen years after, St. Germain
again passed through Nanterre, once
more on his way to Britain. He
had not forgotten Genevieve. At
the age of fifteen, she had received
the virgin's veil from the hands of
the Bishop of Paris. Her parents
dying, she went to Paris to reside
with her godmother. Here she
suffered that persecution so often the
lot of those who live godly lives.
Those who outstrip their fellows even
on the path of piety are objects of
envy, and they who leave the beaten
track of everyday religion are derided.
St. Genevieve was visited at
Paris by the holy Bishop of Auxerre,
who saluted her with respect as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
temple in which the divine Presence
was manifest. Her life was one of
prayer and penance. She used to
water her couch with her tears, and
when the adversary of our souls extinguished
the taper that lighted her
vigils she rekindled it with her prayers.
When Attila, king of the Huns,
threatened Paris, she besought the
inhabitants not to leave their homes,
declaring that Heaven would intervene
to save them. The barbarians,
in effect, were dispersed by a storm,
and betook themselves toward Orleans.
In the church of St. Germain
there is a chapel dedicated to St.
Genevieve, with a painting representing
her haranguing the inhabitants of
Paris.</p>

<p>When Childeric besieged Paris,
and sickness and famine were carrying
off the inhabitants, St. Genevieve
laid aside her religious dress,
took command of the boats that went
up the Seine for succor, and brought
back a supply of provisions. And
when the city had to surrender, the
conquerer treated her with marked
respect, and Clovis loved to grant
her petitions. The remains of paganism
were rooted out of Paris through
her influence over him and Clotilda,
and the first church built on the spot
that now bears her name, but then
dedicated under the invocation of Sts.
Peter and Paul. In that church was
the shepherdess of Nanterre buried
beside Clovis and Clotilda. St. Eloi
wrought a magnificent shrine for her
remains, but it was destroyed at the
Revolution, and the contents publicly
burned. A portion of her relics is
now enshrined at the Pantheon. I
found lights burning there, and flowers
and wreaths, and votive offerings,
and the sweet-smelling incense of
prayer rising from a group of people
praying around. But the magnificence
of the Pantheon is miserably
depressing, as Faber says. How
much more I delighted in the interesting
church of St. Etienne du Mont,
where is the curious old tomb of St.
Genevieve! There too were lights
and ex-votos, and an old woman sat
near the tomb to dispense tapers to
those who wished to leave a little
gleam of love and prayer behind
them. Once what lights and jewels
blazed around such shrines, and what
crowds of devout pilgrims! Now,
a few dim tapers, a few prayerful
hearts, light up the place.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Now it is much if here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One dreamer, by thy genial glare,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The steep of Faith's triumphant prime."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Now the world seems to begrudge
the temple of the Most High the silver
and the gold that belong to him.
And jewels are not to be thought of.
Such wealth must be kept in circulation,
that is, on Prince Esterhazy's
coat, I suppose, and by ladies of
fashion. The world nowadays is
like Julian the Apostate, who was displeased
at the magnificence of the
chalices used in the Christian
churches. For me, I love these
offerings from time to eternity, as
Madame de Staël says. Let all that
is most precious be poured out at the
feet of the Saviour, and let no one
murmur if such offerings are crystallized.
I took pleasure in looking at
some splendid vessels of the sanctuary
at Notre Dame, and thought:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">But till that be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll rest contented with it as it is."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In my saunterings I frequently
lingered before the tower of St.
Jacques de la Boucherie, the highest
in Paris, and the most perfect specimen
of Gothic architecture. The remainder
of the church was demolished
at the Revolution. The tower was
saved by the artifice of an architect,
who besought the crowd to imitate the
enlightened English revolutionists,
who destroyed their churches, but
preserved the towers to be converted
into shot-houses! In this church
crowds used to assemble to hear Bourdaloue
thunder, as Madame de Sévigné
expresses it. I fancy I can
hear that uncompromising preacher
ringing out like a trump in the presence
of the Great Monarch, "Thou
art the man!" This exclamation should
have appealed to the heart of the
people, and saved the church he loved
from profanation.</p>

<p>This church was built by the alms
of pious people. Nicholas Flamel
built the portal in 1388, which he covered
with devout images and devices,
which were regarded, even by the
antiquaries of the last century, as
symbols of alchemy. This Flamel
was a benefactor to many churches
and hospitals of Paris, which he took
pleasure in adorning with carvings
in which he made all things tributary,
as it were, to the worship of God.
At first a simple scrivener, he became
painter, architect, chemist, philosopher,
and poet. He certainly had the
fancy of a poet, and wrote in durable
materials. He left by his will nineteen
chalices of silver gilt to as many
churches.</p>

<p>These churches and religious houses
are all connected with the history
of the city. Paris owed its extension
on the north side of the Seine to the
school in the Abbey of St. Germain
de l'Auxerrois, which was famous at
an early age. There were four great
abbeys around Paris in the time of
the third dynasty&mdash;St. Lawrence, St.
Genevieve, St. Germain de l'Auxerrois,
and St. Germain des Près. These
were surrounded by their dependencies,
forming villages which gradually
extended till they united to enclose
the city, then chiefly confined to the
island. The poor loved to live near
these abbeys. St. Germain des
Près, besides providing for the poor
in general, used privately to support
several destitute families who were
ashamed of their poverty. The old
abbots of this monastery were both
lords spiritual and temporal in the
suburbs on that side of the city.
This abbey was a monument of repentance.
Digby says when it was rebuilt
in the year 1000 the great tower
and the portals were left as before.
The statues of eight kings stood at
the entrance, four on the right hand
and four on the left. One of them
held a scroll on which was written the
tragical name of Clodomir. And
another, with no beatific circle around
his head, held an open tablet on
which were the first and last letters
of the name Clotaire. These were
the statues of the murderer and his
victim.</p>

<p>The square tower of the monastery,
built in the time of Charlemagne,
contributed greatly to the defence
of the house against the Normans.
A stout old monk, Abbon, conducted
the defence, and proved himself on
this occasion a valiant defender of
the walls of Zion. Perhaps it was
his skilful hand that wrote an Homeric
poem on the siege of Paris by
the Normans in the year 885. If
not by him, it was by a monk of a
similar name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pré aux Clercs, now the Faubourg
St. Germain, took its name from
being a place of recreation for the
students of this abbey. One of the
scholars, Sylvester de Sacy, so learned
in the Semitic languages, ascribed
the bent of his mind to the aid and encouragement
given him by one of
the monks who took his constitutional
in the abbey gardens at the same
time as the boy, then only twelve
years old.</p>

<p>The library belonging to this abbey
was celebrated in the middle ages,
and there were monks of literary
eminence in the house. Dacherius
was the librarian when he composed
his <i>Spicilegium</i>. Usuard compiled a
martyrology. They had a printing
press set up immediately after the
invention of printing, which gives one
a favorable idea of their mental activity.
Most of these old monastic
libraries were accessible to all; that
of the Abbey of St. Victor was open
to the public three days in the week;
and there were public libraries attached
to some of the parish churches.
In the time of Charles V., rightly
named the Wise, he ordered the
Royal Library of Paris to be illuminated
with thirty portable lamps, and
that a silver one should be suspended
in the centre for the benefit of those
students who prolonged their researches
into the night. The numerous
collections of books in Paris
made that city very attractive to
certain minds even in the middle
ages. Richard de Bury, Bishop of
Durham, in England, who established
the first public library in that
country, used to resort to Paris for
fresh supplies. "O blessed God of
gods in Sion!" he exclaims, "what a
flood of pleasure rejoices our heart
whenever we are at liberty to visit
Paris, that paradise of the world,
where the days always seem too
short and too few through the immensity
of our love! There are
libraries more redolent of delight than
all the shops of aromatics; there are
the flowering meadows of all volumes
that can be found anywhere. There,
indeed, untying our purse-strings, and
opening our treasures, we disperse
money with a joyful heart (evidently
the truth, for he paid the Abbot of
St. Albans fifty pounds weight of
silver for thirty or forty volumes), and
ransom with dirt books that are beyond
all price. But lo! how good
and pleasant a thing it is to gather
together in one place the arms of
clerical warfare, that there may be
a supply of them for us to use in the
wars against heretics, should they
ever rise up against us!"</p>

<p>What would this book-loving prelate
have done had he foreseen that
the church would one day be accused
of being a foe to progress and to the
diffusion of knowledge! This bishop,
who lived in the thirteenth century,
was the Chancellor and High Treasurer
of England, and celebrated for
his love and encouragement of literature.
He had libraries in all his
palaces, and the apartment he commonly
occupied was so crammed
with books that he was almost inaccessible.
He was said to breathe
books, so fond was he of being among
them. None but a genuine lover of
books would give such amusing directions
for their preservation. "Not
only do we serve God," says he, "by
preparing new books, but also by preserving
and treating with great care
those we have already. Truly, after
the vestments and vessels dedicated
to our Lord's body, sacred books deserve
to be treated with most reverence
by clerks. In opening and
shutting books, they should avoid all
abruptness, not too hastily loosing the
clasps, nor failing to shut them when
they have finished reading, for it is
far more important to preserve a book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
than a shoe." He then goes on to
speak of soiling books; of marking
passages with the finger-nails, "like
those of a giant;" of swelling the
junctures of the binding with straws
or flowers; and of eating over them,
leaving the fragments in the book, as
if the reader had no bag for alms.
Waxing warm over the idea, he
wishes such persons might have to
sit over leather with a shoemaker!
And then there are impudent youths,
who presume to fill up the broad
margins with their unchastened pens,
noting down whatever frivolous thing
occurs to their imagination! And
"there are some thieves, too, who
cut out leaves or letters, which kind
of sacrilege ought to be prohibited
under the penalty of anathema." The
bishop had evidently had some sad
experience with his cherished tomes.
His testimony respecting the appreciation
of books by the monks of his
time is valuable. Remember the age,
reader&mdash;that period of deepest darkness
just before the dawn! "The
monks who are so venerable," says
he in his <i>Philobiblion</i>, "are accustomed
to be solicitous in regard to
books, and to be delighted in their
company, as with all riches, and
thence it is that we find in most
monasteries such splendid treasures
of erudition, giving a delectable light
to the path of laics. Oh! that devout
labor of their hands in writing books;
how preferable to all georgic care!
All things else fail with time. Saturn
ceases not to devour his offspring, for
oblivion covereth the glory of the
world. But God hath provided a
remedy for us in books, without which
all that was ever great would have
been without memory. Without
shame we may lay bare to books the
poverty of human ignorance. They
are the masters who instruct us without
rods, without anger, and without
<em>money</em>. (The bishop had evidently
forgotten those fifty pounds of silver,
and many more besides!) O books!
alone liberal and making liberal, who
give to all, and seek to emancipate
all who serve you. You are the
tree of life and the river of Paradise,
with which the human intelligence is
irrigated and made fruitful."</p>

<p>But I did not always linger at the
doors of churches, studying the walls
and pondering on their history. The
true Catholic knows that these magnificent
churches are only vast shrines
enclosing the great Object of his adoration
and love. M. Olier, when
travelling, never saw the spire of a
church in the distance without calling
upon all with him to repeat the
Tantum Ergo. He used to say:
"When I see a place where my
Master reposes, I have a feeling of
unutterable joy." This feeling comes
over every one at the first glimpse
of that undying lamp before the tabernacle,
"that small flame which
rises and falls like a dying pulse,
flickering up and down, emblematic
of our lives, which even now thus
wastes and wanes."</p>

<p>The very first act on stepping into
a church completely changes the
current of one's thoughts. The holy
water, the sign of the cross, dispel
the remembrance of material things
and recall devout thoughts of the
Passion.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bénitiers</i> at St. Sulpice are two
immense shells, given to Francis the
First by the Republic of Venice; but
for all that, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eau bénite</i> seemed
just as holy, and I made the sign of
the cross just as devoutly.</p>

<p>For devotion, I prefer the largest
churches, because the seclusion is
more perfect, as at Notre Dame.
Behind some pillar or in the depths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of some dim chapel, one can find
perfect solitude where he can be
alone with God. Alone with God!
that in itself is prayer. The world-weary
soul finds it good simply to sit
or kneel with clasped hands in the
divine Presence.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"My spirit I love to compose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In humble trust my eyelids close<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With reverential resignation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wish conceived, no thought expressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only a sense of supplication."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Joubert says the best prayers are
those that have nothing distinct, and
which thus partake of simple adoration;
and Hawthorne asks: "Could
I bring my heart in unison with those
praying in yonder church with a fervor
of supplication but no distinct
request, would not that be the safest
kind of prayer?" Surely every devout
soul feels that "prayer is not
necessarily petition," and what is technically
known as the prayer of contemplation
is the very inspiration of
such churches. In this temple of
silence, man seems to be brought
back to his primeval relations with
his Creator.</p>

<p>What mute eloquence in these
walls! What an appeal to the imagination
in the calmness! Earthly voices
die away on the threshold, and peace,
dovelike, broods over the very entrance.
A daily visit to such a temple
gives life a certain elevation. The
very poor who come here to pray
must acquire a certain dignity of
character. How many generations
have worshipped beneath these arches!
The saints have passed over
the very pavement I tread. I recall
St. Louis, who, out of respect to our
Lord, had laid off his shoes and divested
himself of his royal robes,
bearing solemnly into this church
the holy Crown of Thorns. And great
sinners, too, are in this long procession
of the past. There is Count
Raymond of Toulouse, barefoot, and
clad only in the white tunic of a penitent,
coming to receive absolution
from the papal legate before the
grand altar.</p>

<p>When one recalls the popes, cardinals,
and other dignitaries of the
church, the kings and queens and
knights of the olden time who have
been here, one almost shrinks from
entering such a throng of the mighty
ones of the earth. It seems as if he
were elbowing the Great Monarch or
the gallant Henry of Navarre.</p>

<p>On the galleries around the nave
were formerly suspended the flags
and standards taken in war, and it
was in allusion to this custom that
the Prince of Conti, after the victories
of Fleurus, Steinkerque, and La Marsaille,
made an opening in the crowd
around the door of the church for the
Marechal de Luxembourg, whom he
held by the hand, by crying: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Place,
place, messieurs, au tapissier de Notre
Dame!</span>"&mdash;"Room, room, gentlemen,
for the upholsterer of Notre Dame!"</p>

<p>It is charming to see the birds
flying about in the arches of this
church, as if nature had taken its
venerable walls to her bosom. It
made me think of the old hermits of
the middle ages, living with the sea-birds
in their ocean caves. Like St.
Francis, the canons of Notre Dame
say the divine office with their "little
sisters, the birds;" and the bird is the
symbol of the soul rising heavenward
on the wings of prayer. We, like the
birds, build our nests here for a few
days. Blessed are we if they are
built within the influences of the sanctuary
which temper the storms and
severities of life. It is only in the
clefts of the rocks that wall in the
mystic garden of the church that
there is safety for the dovelike soul.</p>

<p>In the transept is the altar of Our
Lady, starry with lamps. Above her
statue is one of her titles, appealing
to every heart&mdash;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Consolatrix afflictorum!</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
To this church M. Olier came,
in all his troubles, to the altar of
Mary. There is also a fine statue
of her over the grand altar, formerly
at the Carmes. No church is complete
without an altar of the Blessed
Virgin. Wherever there is a cross,
Mary must be at its foot, as at Calvary,
directing our eyes, our thoughts,
our hearts, to him who hangs thereon.</p>

<p>In traversing Paris, one passes
many private residences of interest
which have a certain consecration&mdash;the
consecration of wit and genius.
I cannot say I ever went so far as
Horace Walpole, who never passed
the Hôtel de Carnavalet, the residence
of Madame de Sévigné, without
saying his Ave before it, much as
I admire her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</i>, and though she
was the granddaughter of St. Jane
de Chantal, the foundress of the Nuns
of the Visitation. Walpole thought
the house had a foreign-looking
air, and said it looked like an ex-voto
raised in her honor by some of
her foreign votaries. It was once an
elegant residence, with its sculptured
gateway and Ionic pilasters, and its
court adorned with statues. In the
day of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">spirituelle</i> letter-writer, it
was the resort of the learned and the
refined; now, O tempora! it is a
boarding-school, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> of
Madame de Sévigné (the temple of
"Notre Dame de Livry," to quote
Walpole again, if it be not profanity)
is converted into a dormitory. Truly,
as Bishop de Bury says, "all things
pass away with time," but the wit
and genius she embodied in her
charming letters are eternal.</p>

<p>In one of the upper stories of a
house in the Rue St. Honoré lived
Joubert, the Coleridge of France.
His keeping-room was flooded with
the light he loved, and from it, as he
said, he saw a great deal of sky and
very little earth. There he passed
his days among the books he had
collected. He rigorously excluded
from his library all the books he disapproved
of; unwilling, as he said, to
admit an unworthy friend to his constant
companionship. To this room
he attracted a brilliant circle of conspicuous
authors and statesmen by
his conversational talents, and there
he wrote his immortal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pensées</i>. He
said he left Paris unwillingly, because
then he had to part from his friends;
and he left the country unwillingly,
because he had to part from himself.
Writing from that sunny room, he
says: "In many things, I am like the
butterfly; like him, I love the light;
like him, I there consume my life;
like him, I need, in order to spread
my wings, that there be fair weather
around me in society, and that my
mind feel itself surrounded and as if
penetrated by the mild temperature of
indulgence." But he wrote graver
and more profound things there.
One of his friends said of him that
he seemed to be a soul that by accident
had met with a body, and was
trying to make the best of it. And
he, ever indulgent to the faults of
others, said of his friends, "When
they are blind of one eye, I look at
them in profile."</p>

<p>The Abbaye aux Bois is interesting
from its association with Madame
Récamier and her circle. Her rooms
were in the third story and paved
with tiles, and they overlooked the
pleasant garden of the monastery,
and, when lit up with wit and genius,
they needed no other attraction.
Among her visitors there were Sir
Humphry Davy, Maria Edgeworth,
Humboldt, Lamartine, Delphine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Gay, Chateaubriand, etc. They
must have been like the gods, speaking
from peak to peak all around
Olympus. Lamartine read his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Méditations</i>
there before they were given
to the public. Chateaubriand thus
speaks of the room: "The windows
overlooked the garden of the abbey,
under the verdant shade of which the
nuns paced up and down, and the
pupils played. The top of an acacia
was on a level with the eye, sharp
spires pierced the sky, and in the distance
rose the hills of Sèvres. The
rays of the setting sun threw a golden
light over the landscape and came in
through the open windows. Some
birds were settling themselves for the
night on the top of the window-blinds.
Here I found silence and
solitude, far above the tumult and
turmoil of a great city."</p>

<p>To the church of the abbey, a plain,
unpretending structure, Eugénie de
Guérin went every day to Mass during
her first visit to Paris. There, too,
were the bans of her brother Maurice
published, and there he was
married.</p>

<p>The house of Madame Swetchine,
in the Rue St. Dominique, must be
regarded with veneration. There
was no austerity about the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i> of
this remarkable woman. It was
adorned with pictures, bronzes, and
flowers, and in the evening it was
illuminated with a profusion of lamps
and candles, giving it a festive air.
And then the great lights of the
church, always diffusing their radiance
and aroma in that favored room,
Lacordaire, De Ravignan, Dupanloup,
De la Bouillerie, etc. To have
found one's self among them must
have seemed like being among the
prophets on Mount Carmel. They all
loved to officiate and preach in her
beautiful private chapel, which was
adorned with a multitude of precious
stones from the Russian mines,
gleaming around the ineffable presence
of the Divinity. Mary, too,
was there. On the base of her silver
statue was her monogram in diamonds,
which Madame Swetchine
had worn as maid of honor to the
Empress Mary of Russia.</p>

<p>These circles, and many others I
could recall, are now broken up for
ever. We have all heard and read so
much of those who composed them
that they seem like personal friends.
We linger around the places to which
they imparted a certain sacredness,
and follow them in thought to the
world of mystery and eternal reunion,
thanking God that the great gulf
from the finite to the infinite has
been bridged over by the Incarnation.</p>

<p>One morning, I went to the church
of the Carmelites. A tablet on the
wall points out the spot where the heart
of Monseigneur Affre was deposited&mdash;the
heart of him who gave his life
for his flock. Around it were suspended
some wreaths. On one, of
immortelles, was painted, in black letters,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A mon Père</i>, the offering of one
of his spiritual children. Wishing to
have some objects of devotion blessed,
I went into the sacristy (I remembered
Eugénie de Guérin speaks
of going into that sacristy), where I
found one of the monks prostrate in
prayer, making his thanksgiving after
Mass. Enveloped in his habit,
his bald head covered by a cowl, he
looked like a ghost from the dark
ages. Not venturing to approach
the ghostly father, I made known
my errand to a good-natured-looking
lay brother, who conveyed it to that
part of the cowl where the right ear
of the monk might reasonably be
supposed to be, which brought back
the holy man to earth, causing me
some compunction of conscience.
The brother spread out my articles,
brought the ritual and the stole, and
the father, throwing back his cowl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
murmured over them the prayers of
holy church, and then disappeared
into the monastery. Presently I
heard the voices of the monks saying
the office, which they do, like
nuns, in choir and behind a curtained
grate, so they are not seen from
the church.</p>

<p>This monastery may be compared
to the Roman amphitheatre where
the early Christians were thrown to
the wild beasts. Here indeed was
fought the good fight, and the victors
rose to heaven with palms in
their hands. I know of nothing
more sublime and thrilling in the
annals of the church than the massacre
of about two hundred priests
that took place here on the second
of September, 1792. I cannot refrain
from giving a condensed account
of it by one of the writers of
the day: "For some weeks there
had been assembled and heaped together
two hundred priests, who had
refused to take the schismatic oath,
or had nobly recanted it. During
the first day of their incarceration,
these loyal priests had been inhumanly
imprisoned in the church.
The guards in their midst watched
to prevent their having the consolation
of even speaking to each other.
Their only nourishment was bread
and water. The stone floor was their
bed. It was only later that a few
were permitted to have straw beds.
These priests, whom martyrdom was
to render immortal, had at their head
three prelates whose virtues recall
the primitive days of the church.
Their chief was the Archbishop of
Arles, Monseigneur du Lau. He had
been deputed to the states-general;
his piety equalled his knowledge;
and his humility even surpassed his
merit. The day after the memorable
10th of August he had been sent to
the Carmelite monastery (then converted
into a prison) with sixty-two
other priests. Notwithstanding his
age (he was over eighty) and his infirmities,
he refused all indulgences
that were not also extended to his
brother-captives. For several days
a wooden arm-chair was his bed as
well as his pontifical throne. Thence
his persuasive words instilled into
those around him the sentiments of
ineffable charity that filled his own
heart, and when his exhausted voice
could no longer make itself heard,
his very appearance expressed a sublime
resignation.</p>

<p>"Two other bishops, brothers, bearing
the name of De la Rochefoucauld,
one the Bishop of Beauvais,
and the other of Saintes, also encouraged
their companions in misfortune
by their words and by their example.
The Bishop of Saintes had
not been arrested, but, wishing to join
his brother, he made himself a prisoner.
There were members of
every rank in the ecclesiastical hierarchy:
M. Hébert, the confessor
of the king who wrote to him
at the beginning of August, 'I expect
nothing more from man, bring
me therefore the consolations of heaven;'
the general of the Benedictines,
the Abbé de Lubusac, several
of the curés of Paris, Mr. Gros, called
the modern Vincent of Paul, and
priests brought from various places,
holy victims whom the God of Calvary
had chosen to associate with his
sufferings, and judged worthy of the
most glorious of all deaths&mdash;that of
martyrdom.</p>

<p>"For more than two days, the
wretches who hovered around their
enclosure had filled the air with cries
of blood, and predicting that the sacrifice
was about to take place. One
said to the Archbishop of Arles: 'My
lord, on the morrow your grace is to
be killed.' These derisive insults recalled
to the holy captives the judgment-hall
of their divine Master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and like him they bore them in silence,
forgiving and praying for their
enemies.</p>

<p>"On the second of September they
could no longer doubt that their last
hour had arrived. The hurried movements
of the troops, the cries in the
neighboring streets, and the alarm-guns
they heard made them somewhat
aware of the sinister events that
were passing without. At the dawn
of day they had gathered together
in the church. They made their
confessions to each other, they blessed
one another, and partook of the
Holy Eucharist. They were singing
the Benediction together at about
five in the evening when the ominous
cries came nearer. Then two
holy hymns succeeded the prayers
for the dying. All at once the jailers
entered, and began calling the roll,
which already had been done three
times that day. The prisoners were
then ordered into the garden, which
they found occupied by guards armed
with pikes and wearing the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnet
rouge</i>. The murderers filled the
courts, the halls, and the church,
making the venerable arches re-echo
to the noise of their weapons and
their blasphemies. The priests, one
hundred and eighty-five in number,
were divided into two groups. About
thirty, among whom were the bishops,
rushed toward a little oratory
at the extremity of the garden, where
they threw themselves upon their
knees, recommending themselves to
God. They embraced each other for
the last time, and began saying the
vespers for the dead, when suddenly
the gates were flung open, and the
assassins rushed in from various directions.</p>

<p>"The sight of these holy priests
upon their knees arrested their fury
for an instant. The first who fell
under their blows was Father Gerault,
who was reciting his breviary regardless
of their cries. That breviary,
pierced with a ball and stained with
blood, was discovered on the spot at
the restoration of the Carmelites, and
it is preserved as a precious relic.
Then the Archbishop of Arles was
demanded. While they were seeking
him through the alleys, he was
exhorting his companions to offer to
God the sacrifice of their lives.
Hearing his name called, he knelt
down, and asked the most aged of
the priests to give him absolution;
then, rising, he advanced to meet the
assassins. With his arms crossed
upon his breast and his eyes raised
toward heaven, he uttered in a calm
voice the same words his divine Master
addressed to his enemies: "I am
he whom you seek." The first stroke
of the sword was upon his forehead,
but the venerable man remained
standing; a second made the blood
flow in torrents, but still he did not
fall; the fifth laid him on the ground,
when a pike was driven through his
heart. Then he was trampled under
the feet of the assassins, who exclaimed,
'Vive la nation!'</p>

<p>"The general massacre then ensued.
While the unfortunate priests, with
the instinct of self-preservation, were
flying at random through the garden,
some screening themselves behind
the hedges and others climbing the
trees, the murderers fired at them,
and, when one of them fell, they
would rush upon his body, prolong
his agony, and exult over his sufferings.
About forty perished in this
manner. Some of the younger
priests succeeded in scaling the walls
and hiding themselves; but, remembering
they were flying from martyrdom
and that their escape might excite
greater fury against their companions,
they retraced their steps
and received their reward! The
Bishop of Beauvais and his brother
were in the garden oratory with thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
priests. A grating separated
them from the murderers, who fired
upon them, killing the greater number.
The Bishop of Beauvais was
not touched, but his brother had a
leg broken by a ball.</p>

<p>"For an instant this horrid butchery
was suspended. One of the leaders
ordered all the priests into the church,
whither they were driven&mdash;even the
wounded and dying&mdash;at the sword's
point. There they gathered around
the altar, offering anew to their Saviour
the sacrifice of their lives, whilst
their executioners, calling them out
two by two, finished their butchery
more promptly and completely. To
each one life was offered on condition
of taking the revolutionary oath. They
all refused, and not one escaped.
Whilst these assassins added blasphemous
shouts to their murderous
strokes, whilst they demolished the
crosses and the tabernacles, the holy
phalanx of priests, which death was
every moment lessening, kept praying
for their murderers and their
country. The two bishops were
among the last executed. When
it came to the turn of the Bishop
of Beauvais, he left the altar upon
which he had been leaning, and calmly
advanced to meet his death. His
brother, whose wound prevented his
walking, asked for assistance, and
was carried out to his execution. It
was eight in the evening when the
last execution took place. Over four
hundred priests were massacred in
different parts of Paris at this period,
besides many isolated murders."</p>

<p>The constancy of these martyrs
has made many do more than exclaim
with Horace Walpole: "Almost
thou persuadest me to be a
Catholic!" He says, in a letter
dated October 14, 1792: "For the
French priests, I own I honor them.
They preferred beggary to perjury,
and have died or fled to preserve the
integrity of their consciences. It certainly
was not the French clergy but
the philosophers that have trained up
their countrymen to be the most
bloody men upon earth."</p>

<p>In 1854, this monastery, where flowed
the blood of martyrs and which had
echoed with their dying groans, resounded
with the strains of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">O Salutaris
Hostia!</i> on the festival of Corpus
Christi, and priests bore the divine
Host through the alleys of the
garden where, sixty years before, had
rushed those who were swift to shed
blood. An altar had been erected
under the yew-tree where the Archbishop
of Arles fell. Children scattered
flowers over the place once
covered with blood. Well might the
pale-lipped clergy tearfully chant in
such a spot:</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">The white-robed army of martyrs praise thee!</span>"</p>

<p>Every age has its martyrs. They
are the glory of the church, and their
blood is its seed. The church must
ever suffer with its divine spouse.
Sometimes its head&mdash;the Vicar of
Christ-is crowned with thorns;
sometimes its heart bleeds from a
thrust in the very house of its
friends; and, again, its feet and
hands are nailed in the extremities
of the earth.</p>

<p>And every follower of Christ crucified
has his martyrdom&mdash;a martyrdom
of the soul, if not of the body.
The sacred stigmata are imprinted
on every soul, that embraces the
cross, and no one can look upon him
who hangs thereon, with the eyes of
faith, without catching something of
his resemblance. Suffering is now,
as when he was on earth, the glorious
penalty of those who approach the
nearest to his Divine Person.</p>

<h2>SOR JUANA INES DE LA CRUZ.</h2>


<p>So little is known of Spanish
American literature that any fresh
report from its pages seems to have
the nature of a revelation. Our
acquaintance with Heredia, Placido,
Milanes, Mendive, Carpio, Pesado,
Galvan, Calderon, is slight or naught;
yet these poets are most interesting
on account of the countries, peoples,
and causes for which they speak eloquently,
even if we deny that they
add greatly to the genuine substance
of our literary possession. Less
question, however, can be entertained
of the importance of some older
names whose fame made for itself a
refuge in the Spanish churches and
cloisters of the New World long before
revolutionists took to shooting
the Muses on the wing. In the
seventeenth century lived and wrought
Cabrera, Siguenza, and Sor or Sister
Juana Ines. They belonged to a
country which claimed for awhile as
its scholars, though not as its natives,
Doctor Valbuena, author of the very
well-known epical fantasy called <cite>The
Bernardo</cite>, and Mateo Alaman, who
wrote the famous story of <cite>Guzman de
Alfarache</cite>. Juan Ruiz de Alarcon,
one of the most remarkable dramatic
poets of a great dramatic age, was a
native of that same country, Mexico.
Siguenza, as mathematician, historian,
antiquary, and poet, has been well esteemed
by Humboldt and the scholars
of his own race. It is much to
say that the land which produced an
artist as great as Cabrera also gave
birth to a scholar and poet as renowned
in her day and as appreciable
in ours as Sor Juana Ines de la
Cruz. Among all these celebrities,
who would have been eminent in
any time among any people, this
Mexican nun of the seventeenth century
holds a place of her own.
Looking back upon the past with all
our modern light, we cannot but regard
her as one of the most admirable
characters of the New World.</p>

<p>Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz was
born at San Miguel de Nepantla,
twelve leagues from the city of
Mexico, in the year 1651, and died
at the age of forty-four. When but
three years old, she was able to read,
write, and "cipher," and at eight
she wrote a prologue for the feast of
the Holy Sacrament. Once she cut
her hair, and would not allow it to
grow till she had acquired the learning
she proposed to herself, seeing
no reason why a head should be
covered with hair that was denuded
of knowledge, its best ornament.
After twenty lessons, it was said, she
knew Latin, and so great was her desire
to learn that she importuned her
parents to send her to the University
of Mexico in boy's clothes. When
seventeen years of age, and a cherished
inmate of the Viceroy Mancera's
family, she amazed a large company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the professors and scholars of the
capital by tests of her various erudition
and abilities. Notwithstanding
her beauty and fortune, her rank and
accomplishments, and the life of a
gallant and brilliant court, she determined
at that early age to retire to a
cloister, and in a few years became
known as Sor Juana of San Geronimo,
a convent of the city of Mexico.
After this appeared her poems, <cite>The
Crisis</cite> and <cite>The Dream</cite>, in the latter
of which she writes much of mythology,
physics, medicine, and history,
according to the scholastic manner of
her time. With these and her subsequent
poetic writings, such as her
sonnets, loas, romances, and autos,
she had rare fame, and won from
some of her admirers the enthusiastic
titles of "The Phœnix of Mexico,"
"Tenth Muse," and "Poetess of America."
The writer has an old volume
before him bearing literally this title-page:
"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Fama, y Obras Posthumas
del Fenix de Mexico, y Dezima Musa,
Poetisa de la America, Sor Juana
Ines de la Cruz, Religiosa Professa
en el Convento de San Geronimo, de
la Imperial Ciudad de Mexico. Recogidas
y dadas a luz por el Doctor
Don Juan Ignacio de Castorena
y Ursua, Capellan de Honor de su
Magestad, y Prebendado de la Santa
Iglesia Metropolitana de Mexico. En
Barcelona: Por Rafael Figuero.
Año de <span class="smcap">MDCCI</span>. Con todas las
licencias necessarias</span>." Thus it appears
we owe to the Prebendary Castorena
the edition of the posthumous
works of Sor Juana given to the light
in 1701, six years after her death.</p>

<p>But, whether as the sister or the
mother of a convent, Juana Ines de
la Cruz was more than a mistress of
vain learning or unprofitable science.
Her daily assiduous exercise was
charity, which at last so controlled
her life and thoughts that she gave
all her musical and mathematical instruments,
all the rich presents which
her talents had attracted from illustrious
people, and all her books, excepting
those she left to her sisters,
to be sold for the benefit of the poor.
Though she had evidently prized
science as the handmaid of religion,
the time came when her verses upon
the vanity of learning reflected a
mind more and more withdrawn from
the affairs of this world to the contemplation
of the next. When an
epidemic visited the Convent of San
Geronimo, and but two out of every
ten invalids were saved, the good,
brave soul of Madre Juana shone
transcendently. Spite of warnings
and petitions, and though all the city
prayed for her life, Madre Juana
perished at her vigil of charity&mdash;the
good angel as well as muse of
Mexico.</p>

<p>Of the enthusiasm created by her
genius, we have abundant and curious
proofs. Don Alonzo Muxica,
"perpetual Recorder of the City of Salamanca,"
wrote a sonnet upon her
having learned to read at the age of
three, when "what for all is but the
break of morn in her was as the middle
of the day." Excelentissimo Sir
Felix Fernandez de Cordova Cordona
y Aragon, Duke of Seffa, of
Væna and Soma, Count of Cabra,
Palomas, and Olivitas, and Grand
Admiral and Captain-General of Naples,
speaks of her in a lofty poetic
encomium as for the third time applauded
by two admiring worlds of
readers, and praises her persuasive
voice as that of a sweet siren of
thought. Don Garcia Ribadeneyra,
with the grandiose wit of his day, says
in a decima that this extraordinary
woman surpassed the sun, for her
glorious genius rose where the sun
set, that is to say, in the West; and
Don Pedro Alfonso Moreno argues
piously that St. John the Baptist's
three crowns of Virgin, Martyr, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Doctor were in measure those of
Madre Juana, who was from early
years chaste, poor in spirit, and obedient,
according to the vow of religious
women. Don Luis Verdejo
declares that she transferred the lyceums
of the Muses to Mexico, and
that the light of her genius is poured
upon two worlds. Padre Cabrera,
chaplain of the Most Excellent Duke
of Arcos, asserts that the Eternal
Knowledge enlightened Juana in all
learning. "Only her fame can define
her," writes one of her own sex;
and when the Poetess of the Cloister
wrote with her own blood a protestation
of faith, it was said of this "Swan
of erudite plume" that she wrote like
the martyr to whose ink of blood the
earth was as paper. Her gift of
books to be sold in order to relieve
the poor inspired Señora Catalina de
Fernandez de Cordova, nun in the
Convent of the Holy Ghost in Alcara,
to say thus thoughtfully:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Without her books did Juana grow more wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for their loss she studied deep content.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, then, that in this human school of ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He only is wise who knows to love his God."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>At thought of her death, Don
Luis Muñoz Venegas, of Granada,
wonders that the sun shines, that
ships sail, that earth is fair, that all
things do not grieve her loss, whose
happy soul in its beatitudes enjoys
the riches of which death has robbed
the world&mdash;sweetness, purity, felicity.
Fray Juan de Rueda, professor of
theology in the college of San Pablo;
Licentiate Villalobos of San Ildefonso,
and Señor Guerra, fellow of the
same college; Advocate Pimienta, of
the Royal Audience, and Bachelor
Olivas, a presbyter; Syndic Torres,
Catedratico or Professor Aviles, Cavalier
Ulloa, have all something to say
in Spanish or Latin on the death of
our poetess. Doctor Aviles imagines
the death of Sor Juana to be like that
of the rose, which, having acquired in
a brief age all its perfection, needed
not to live longer. Don Diego Martinez
suggests beautifully that the profit
which other excellent minds will
derive from the posthumous writings
of the poetess will be like the clearness
which the stars gain by the death
of the sun. Mingled with these honest
tributes of admiration is much extravagance
of comparison; but they
prove at least that Sor Juana was regarded
by the learned of her day as
a woman of astonishing powers.</p>

<p>Amid all her studies and labors,
we read that Sister Juana was constant
in her religious devotions, and
faithful to the least rules of her order.
But her conscientious spirit, moved
by a letter of Bishop Fernandez of
Puebla, determined her at length to
renounce the exercise of her talents
for the strictest and purest ascetism.
Hence, one of her Mexican critics is
led to say that we have only the
echoes of her songs, only the shades
of her images, inasmuch as her sex
and state, and the reigning scholasticism,
were not convenient for the
true expression of her thoughts. The
noble, ascetic literature of Spain, respecting
which it is with reason boasted
that the world contains nothing
of the kind more valuable, discredits
in good part this supposition. Moreover,
the recognition of Sor Juana's
work and genius was, as we have seen,
not inconsiderable. The world is still
in its infancy as regards religious ideality,
and, spite of the highest evidences,
often refuses to believe that
thoughts fed from the divine source
can fulfil the true poem of life, be it
written or acted. What the thoughts
of Sor Juana were like in her ordinary
religious life we understand partly
from a number of daily exercises
and meditations which have come
down to us. Here are specimens of
these compositions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">EXERCISE.</p>

<p>On this day, at seeing the light come
forth, bless its Author who made it so
beautiful a creation, and praise him with
a submissive heart; not only because he
created it for our good, but because he
made it a vassal to his mother and our
mediatrix. Go to Mass with all possible
devotion, and those who can, let them fast
and give thanks to God. Thou shalt sing
the canticle <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Benedicite omnia opera Domini
Domino</i> and the verse <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Benedicite lux</i>. Understand
that not only the just ought to
praise God, who are themselves as light,
but the sinners who are as darkness.
Consider yourselves such, every one of
you, and mourn for having added to the
original transgression, darkness upon
darkness, sins upon sins. Resolve to
correct thyself; and that Mary's purest
light may reach you, recite a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salve</i>, and
nine times the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnificat</i>, face to the
ground, and fly from all sin this day, even
the shadow thereof. Abstain from all impatience,
murmurings, repinings, and suffer
with meekness those evils which are a
repugnance to our nature. If it be a day
of discipline of the community, that is
enough, but if not, it shall be especially
made so. Those who do not know
how to read Latin shall recite nine
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salves</i> mouth to the ground, and shall
fast if they are able, and if not, they
shall make an act of contrition, so that
the Lord may give them light for his timely
service, even as he gave them material
light by which to live.</p>


<p class="center">MEDITATION.</p>

<p>If we look at the properties of the firmament,
what more assimilates to the
miraculous constancy of Mary, whom
neither those steeped in original sin could
make fall, nor the combats of temptation
make stumble! But still, amid the torrents
and tempests of human miseries,
between the troubles of her life, and the
painful passion and death of her most
holy Son and our most beloved Saviour;
amid the waves of incredulity in the
doubts of his disciples; among the hidden
rocks of the perfidy of Judas, and the
uncertainty of so many timid souls&mdash;ever
was her constancy preserved. Not only
was she firm, but beautiful as the firmament,
which (according to the mathematicians)
hath this other excellence, that
it is bordered by innumerable stars, but
has only seven planets which are fixed
and never move. Thus, holiest Mary
was not only most pure in her conception,
transparent and translucent, but afterwards
the Lord adorned her with innumerable
virtues which she acquired,
even as the stars which border that most
beautiful firmament; and she not only
had them all, but had them fixed, all immovable,
all in order and admirable
concert: but if in the other children of
Adam we see some virtues, they are errant&mdash;to-day
we have them, to-morrow
they are gone&mdash;to-day is light, to-morrow
darkness. We will rejoice in her prerogative,
and say unto her:</p>


<p class="center">OFFERING.</p>

<p>Honored Lady, and crown of our human
being, divine firmament where the
stars of virtue are fixed, give their benign
influence to us, thy devoted ones, that by
thy favor we may cure ourselves and acquire
them; and that light which thou
dost partake of the Sun of Righteousness,
communicate it to our souls, and fix in
them thy virtues, the love of thy precious
Son, and thy sweetest and tenderest devotion,
and of thy happy husband, our
patron and advocate, St. Joseph.</p></blockquote>

<p>These compositions doubtless give
us a better idea of the interior thought
of Mexican monasticism than some
yellow-covered speculations. In that
life grew the finest genius, the greatest
woman, perhaps the most remarkable
character in all respects
that Mexico ever produced. Considering
the time and place in which
she wrote, the New World has scarcely
produced her superior among women
of genius. Up to the nineteenth
century America had, doubtless, no,
literary product comparable to the
poems of Sor Juana Ines. What Cabrera,
was to the art, Sor Juana seems
to have been to the literature of her
country; and both these workers of
genius gave their powers to the service
of religion. It is here worthy
of remark that not only were the
greatest painter and poet of Mexico
studious servants of the church, but
that its most celebrated scientist was
the Jesuit Siguenza y Gongora, author
of a funeral eulogy of Sor Juana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Ines, whom he knew and appreciated,
for he, too, was a poet. Without
social helps, without emulation, such
as is ordinarily understood, such
proofs of her high intelligence as we
possess have come to light. Perplexed
as it was with the mannered
erudition of the schools, her poetry
nevertheless reveals noble sensibility
and thought in superior forms. Thus
she sings in her verses entitled "Sentiments
of Absence:"</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Hear me with eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that so distant are thine ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of absence my laments;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In echoes from my pen the groans;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as can reach thee not my voice so rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear thou me deaf, since dumbly I complain."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This is like a voice of the Elizabethan
age; but what <em>woman</em> even
of that day has left us so rare a record
of poetry and piety combined
as the nun of San Geronimo, she
who lived in 1670 in far-off, outlandish
Mexico? What chapter of literature
would seem too good to entertain
this Tenth Muse, to whom we
owe such sonnets as these:</p>

<p>These rude translations give but a
poor idea of the poet's expression,
but they allow the height and quality
of her intellect to be understood. In
one of her most thoughtful poems,
the <cite>Romance on the Vanity of Science</cite>,
she argues against self-seeking knowledge,
and the perils to which genius
exposes itself by too much seeking
its own devices. This poem is so representative
and remarkable that we
must give it entire quotation:</p>

<p>We may dispute, in some respects,
the drift of Sister Juana's philosophy;
but we cannot question the poetic
wisdom of many of her reflections.
How true it is that in a multitude of
reasons one finds no reason at all;
that the rank overgrowth of knowledge
does not bear the best fruit;
that genius, allied with base substance,
grows brighter, by a kind of
self-consuming; that wisdom can
sometimes find refuge in ignorance!
No one, be his fame what it may,
has stated a grand and touching
truth with better force than appears
in Sor Juana's grave misgiving with
regard to the genius "which seeks a
throne in fire, and finds a sepulchre
in tears." Is not this the history, at
once sublime and pathetic, of so
many failures of the restless intellect?
Sor Juana knew how to preach from
such a text, for she was a rare scholar,
and mistress of verse, and religious
woman. The variety of her literary
employments was considerable, in
comparison with the bulk of Mexican
verse and prose, notwithstanding the
old-fashioned manners of her cloistered
muse. She wrote, in addition
to sonnets and romances, the dramatic
religious pieces called loas
and autos, among which we find
dialogues and acts entitled "The
Sceptre of St. Joseph," "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">San Hermengildo</span>,"
and "The Divine Narciso."
Her poetic moods were not,
it appears, limited to hymns and to
blank-verse; indeed, she had the
qualities of a ripe poet&mdash;humor,
fancy, imagination, able thought,
and, if anything else should be added,
doubtless the reader will find it in
the ideality of a sonnet so superb as
the one in praise of Our Lady. Of
her religious tenderness we have a
fine example in the following lines
from "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Divino Narciso</span>," which
have been compared by a Mexican
critic to the best mystical songs of
St. John of the Cross and other
Spanish ascetics. They convey the
appeal which the Shepherd of Souls
makes to a soul which has strayed
from the flock:</p>

<p>Our last quotation from Sister
Juana's poems will be one of those
tributes which, in verse or prose, she
so often paid to the Blessed Virgin.
It is a song taken from her villancicos,
or rhymes for festivals. The
literary manners of her time seem to
have obscured the native excellence
of her thought, but the buoyant style
of the following lines meets with
little objection from her modern Mexican
critic:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To her who in triumph, the beautiful queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descends from the airs of the region serene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her who illumines its vaguest confine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With auroras of gold, and of pearl and carmine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her whom a myriad of voices confessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady of angels, the queen of the blest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose tresses celestial are lightly outborne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And goldenly float in the glory of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waving and rising would seek to o'erwhelm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the gulfs of the Tibar an ivory realm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whose graces the sunlight may learn how to shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stars of the night take a brilliance divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sing thee rejoicing while praises ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O sinless, O stainless! live, live without end.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The scarcity of the poems of Sor
Juana Ines de la Cruz, even in her
native land, is cause for wonder, but
not if we first remark that still greater
marvel&mdash;the long-continued discomposure
of Mexican society. It is one
hundred and seventy years since the
parchment-bound book, from which
we have drawn a number of facts in
the life of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Poetisa</i>, was published.
Our impression of the rarity and age
of her printed works, as derived from
acquaintance with educated Mexicans
in their own country, tempts us
to doubt whether they have been
issued in any complete shape during
the present century. For a good
portion of the extracts we have presented
we are indebted to an intelligent
and scholarly review prepared
in Mexico, two years ago, by Don
Francisco Prinentel, the author of a
number of books on the races and
languages of Mexico. Outside of
the monastic or rich private libraries
of that country, it is doubtless a task
of much difficulty to find the poems
of Sor Juana. For this reason we
are disposed to excuse the able American
historian of Spanish literature for
omitting everything in relation to her
except the mere mention of her name
as a lyrical writer. It is hoped, however,
that this notice of her life and
works, probably the first which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
appeared in the United States, will
supply the omission of what should
be a chief fact in any American notice
of Spanish literature. The claim
which we make for Sor Juana Ines
de la Cruz, as regards the literature
of the New World, is not short of the
very highest.</p>

<h2>DION AND THE SIBYLS.<br />

<small>A CLASSIC, CHRISTIAN NOVEL.</small></h2>

<p class="center">BY MILES GERALD KEON, COLONIAL SECRETARY, BERMUDA, AUTHOR OF
"HARDING THE MONEY-SPINNER," ETC.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>

<p>At the golden gate of the Temple
courtyard, a Roman legionary
soldier (detailed as body-servant to
the General Paulus) met him. The
soldier was leading a small, wiry Tauric
(or really Tartar) horse. Paulus,
twisting a lock of the animal's mane
in his left hand, and taking up with
the little finger thereof the loop of
the bridle, sprang into the ephippia.
The soldier smiled, as the still handsome
and youthful-looking legatus
settled himself on the back of his
steed.</p>

<p>"Why are you smiling, my man?"
quoth Paulus good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"It was like the spring I saw you
take years ago at Formiæ, when I
was a boy, upon the back of the
horse Sejanus, which no man, my
general, ever rode save you," replied
the soldier.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Paulus, smiling sadly;
"were you there? I fear I am not
so agile now. We are all passing
away."</p>

<p>"Just as agile still, my general,"
returned the legionary, in a cordial
tone; "but about twice as strong."</p>

<p>"Away! begone!" cried Paulus,
laughing; "I am growing old." And
shaking the reins, he waved a salute
to Longinus, turned his pony round,
and rode away again into the valley
westward, while the centurion entered
the city by the golden gate, and
repaired under the walls of the Temple
to Fort Antonio, where he was
detailed as officer of Pilate's guard
that night.</p>

<p>Paulus, meanwhile, rode slowly on
his way, between the Kedron Brook
and the walls of Jerusalem, till he
came to the Pool of Siloam. There,
he turned south, galloped to a fort
which was near, turned back again
to his right, or northward, followed
the valley of Hinnom at a walking
pace, looking up at the white and
dazzling buildings on Mount Zion.</p>

<p>As he slowly passed them, he speculated
which could have been David's
palace. He saw Herod's plainly
enough. On his right he noticed
the aqueduct from Solomon's Pool,
and followed its course as far as the
Tower of Hippicus northward. There
he entered the city by the Gate of
Gennath, and followed the valley of
the Cheesemongers (or Tyropæon
hollow) until he came to Ophal.</p>

<p>In the middle of a very narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
street in this low and crowded quarter,
where the Romans afterward under
Titus were repulsed, he met a file
of people, some mounted, some on
foot, led by a richly-dressed, haughty-looking,
burly man, riding a
mule.</p>

<p>So narrow was the street that either
Paulus would have had to go back
as far as the Tower of Marianne, or
the richly-dressed and haughty-looking
man about one-quarter of the
distance, to the bridge between the
street of the Cheesemongers and the
court of the Gentiles. Paulus, always
full of courtesy, amenity, and
sweetness, was in the very act of
turning his small Tauric horse, when
the burly man in rich dress, who led
the opposing file, called out, "Back!
low people! Back, and let Caiaphas
go by!"</p>

<p>"And who is Caiaphas?" demanded
Paulus, instantly facing round
again and barring the way.</p>

<p>"The high-priest of Jerusalem,"
was the answer, thundered forth in
rude and minatory tones.</p>

<p>"I respect," said Paulus, "and
even revere that holy appellation;
but he who uses it at this moment,
for some present purpose, has flung
against me, who am a Roman general,
the mandate of <i>Back, low people</i>.
Where are the low people? I do
not believe that I am a low person.
Where, then, are the low people?"</p>

<p>"Come on," cried the imperious
voice of Caiaphas.</p>

<p>He himself, being the file leader,
began then to move forward, till he
came immediately in front of the traveller
who had so courteously spoken
to him.</p>

<p>"If you want," said Paulus, "to
pass me at once, I must get into the
ditch, or throw you into it; which do
you prefer?"</p>

<p>"I prefer," quoth Caiaphas, "that
you should throw me into the ditch,
if you either dare or can."</p>

<p>"Sir," says Paulus, "I am sorry
for the sentiment you express, or at
least imply. But I will stand up
against your challenge of throwing
you into the ditch, because I both
could do it, and dare do it, as a Roman
soldier, only that there is <span class="smcap">One</span>
among you who has come to settle
all our disputes, and who has a divine
right to do so. For his sake I
would rather be thrown into that
drain by you&mdash;soldier, officer, general,
and Roman as I am&mdash;than throw you
into it."</p>

<p>"Let me pass," cried Caiaphas,
purple with rage.</p>

<p>Paulus, whose behavior at Lake
Benacus against the Germans, and
previously at Formiæ, and afterward
in the terrible Calpurnian House on
the Viminal Hill, the reader remembers,
made no answer, but, riding
back to the Tower of Marianne,
allowed the high-priest and his followers
there to pass him; which they
did with every token of scorn and
act of contumely that the brief and
sudden circumstances allowed. Caiaphas
thus passed on to his country-house
at the southwest-by-south of
Jerusalem, where he usually spent the
night.</p>

<p>Paulus then put his pony into a
gallop, and soon reached the bridge
across the Tyropæon into the courtyard
of the Temple, commonly called
the courtyard of the Gentiles. Such
was the nervous excitement caused by
his recent act of purely voluntary, gratuitous,
and deliberate self-humiliation,
that he laughed aloud as he rode
through the Temple yard, coasting
the western "cloisters," and so reaching
Fort Antonio.</p>

<p>There his servant, the Roman legionary,
who had before met him at
the golden gate, and whose name
was Marcus, was awaiting him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV.</h3>

<p>That night the palace of Herod
the tetrarch resounded with music,
and all the persons of rank or distinction
in Jerusalem were among the
guests. The entertainment would
have been remembered for years on
account of its brilliancy; it was destined
to be remembered for all ages,
even till the day of doom, on account
of its catastrophe, chronicled
in the books of God, and graven in
the horror of men.</p>

<p>Paulus, unusually grave, because
experiencing unwonted sensations,
and anxious calmly to analyze them,
was assailed for the first time in his
life by a feeling of nervous irritability,
which originated (though he knew it
not) in his having suppressed the natural
desire to chastise the insolence
of Caiaphas that morning. He sat
abstracted and silent, not far from
the semi-royal chair of Herod the
tetrarch. His magnificent dress, well-earned
military fame, and manly and
grave beauty (never seen to greater
advantage than at that period of
life, though the gloss of youth was
past) had drawn toward him during
the evening an unusual amount of
attention, of which he was unconscious,
and to which he would have
been indifferent.</p>

<p>The "beauty of the evening," as
she was called (for in those days
they used terms like those which we
moderns use, to express our infatuation
for the gleams of prettiness
which are quenched almost as soon
as they are seen), had repeatedly endeavored
to attract his attention.
She was royal; she was an unrivalled
dancer. Herod, who began to feel
dull, begged her to favor the company
with a dance, <i>sola</i>. Thereupon
the daughter of Herodias looked at
Paulus, to whom her previous blandishments
had been addressed in vain
(he was well known to be unmarried),
and heaved a fiery sigh. The mere
noise of it ought to have awakened
his notice, and yet failed to accomplish
even that small result. Had it
succeeded, he was exactly the person
to have regarded this woman with a
feeling akin to that which, some two-and-twenty
years before, she herself
(or was it Herodias? they age fast in
the East) had waked in the bosom
of his sister under the veranda in
the bower of Crispus's inn, leading
out of the fine old Latian garden
near the banks of the Liris.</p>

<p>She proceeded to execute her <i>ballet</i>,
her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pas seul</i>, her dance of immortal
shame and fatal infamy. Cries
of delight arose. The creature grew
frantic. The court of Herod fell into
two parties. One party proclaimed
the performance a perfection of
elegance and spirit. The other party
said not a word, but glances of
painful feeling passed among them.
The clamorous eulogists formed the
large majority. In the silent minority
was numbered Paulus, who never
in his life had felt such grave disgust
or such settled indignation. He
thought of his pure and innocent Esther&mdash;alas,
<em>not</em> his! He thought
that, had it been his sister Agatha
who thus outraged every rudimentary
principle of the tacit social compact,
he could almost find it in his
heart to relieve the earth of her.</p>

<p>Thus pondering, his glance fell
upon Herod the tetrarch. The tetrarch
seemed to have become delirious.
He was laughing, and crying,
and slobbering, and clapping his
hands, and rolling his head, and
rocking his body on the great state
cushion under the canopy, where he
"sat at table." While Paulus was
contemplating him in wonder and
shame, the wretched dancer came to
an end of her bounds. Indecency,
scientifically accidental, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the one simple principle of the exhibition.
Herod called the practised
female before him, and, in the hearing
of several, bade her demand from
him any reward she pleased, and declared
upon oath that he would grant
her demand. Paulus heard the answer.
After consulting apart with
her mother, she reapproached the tetrarch,
and, with a flushed face, said
that she desired the head of a prisoner
upon a dish.</p>

<p>"What prisoner?"</p>

<p>"John," said she.</p>

<p>Paulus gazed at the miserable tetrarch,
"the quarter of a king," not
from the height of his rank as a Roman
general, but from the still greater
height which God had given him
as one of the first, one of the earliest
of European gentlemen. He knew
not then who John was. But that
any fellow-creature in prison, not
otherwise to be put to death, should
have his head hewn off and placed
upon a dish, because a woman had
tossed her limbs to and fro in a style
which pleased a tetrarch while it
disgraced human society, appeared
to Paulus to be less than reasonable.
What he had said, the tetrarch had
said upon oath.</p>

<p>A little confusion, a slight murmuring
and whispering ensued, but
the courtly music soon recommenced.
Paulus could not afterward tell how
long it was before the most awful
scene he had ever witnessed occurred.</p>

<p>A menial entered, bearing, on a
large dish, a freshly-severed human
head, bleeding at the neck.</p>

<p>"It was not a jest, then," said Paulus,
in a low voice to his next neighbor,
a very old man, whose face he
remembered, but whose name he had
all the evening been trying in vain
to recall&mdash;"it was not a base jest, dictated
by the hideous taste of worse
than barbarians!"</p>

<p>"Truly," replied the aged man,
"these Jews are worse than any barbarians
I ever saw, and I have seen
most of them."</p>

<p>Paulus recognized at these words
the geographer Strabo, formerly his
companion at the court of Augustus.</p>

<p>At a sign from Herod, the menial
carrying the dish now approached
the daughter of Herodias, and presented
to her the bleeding and sacred
head. She, in turn, took the dish
and offered it to Herodias, who herself
bore it out of the room with a
kind of snorting laugh.</p>

<p>Paulus rose slowly and deliberately
from his place near the tetrarch,
at whom he steadily looked.</p>

<p>"This, then," said he, "is the entertainment
to which you have invited
a Roman legatus. You are vexed,
people say, that Pilate, the Roman
governor of this city, could not honor
your birthday by his presence in
your palace. Pilate's local authority
is of course greater than mine, for I
have none at all; but his real, permanent
rank, and your own real,
permanent importance, are contemptible
by the side of those which a Roman
soldier of such a family as the
Æmilian has gained on the field of
battle; and it was a high honor to
yourself to succeed in bringing me
hither. And now, while disgracing
your own house, you have insulted
your guests. What is the name
of the man you have murdered because
a woman dances like a goat?
What is his name?"</p>

<p>The tetrarch, astonished and over-awed,
replied with a bewildered look:</p>

<p>"What authority to rebuke me, because
I took my brother's wife, had
John?"</p>

<p>"John who?" asked Paulus, who
from the outset had been struck by
the name.</p>

<p>"He who was styled John the Baptist,"
said the tetrarch.</p>

<p>The words of another John rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
in Paulus's memory; and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What! John the Baptist? John
the Baptist, yea, and more than a
prophet&mdash;John the Angel of God!
Is this he whom you have slain?"</p>

<p>"What had he to say to my marriage?"
answered Herod, through
whose purple face a livid under-color
was penetrating to the surface.</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Paulus, "the
holy books of your own nation forbade
such a marriage, and John could
not hear of it without rebuking you.
I, although a Gentile, honor those
books. Out upon you, impious assassin!
I ask not, where was your
mercy, or where your justice; but
where has been your sense of common
decency, this evening? I shall
never cease to lament that I once
stood under your roof. My presence
was meant as an honor to you; but it
has proved a disgrace to myself."</p>

<p>Taking his scarlet cloak, he flung
it over his shoulders, and left the
hall amid profound silence&mdash;a silence
which continued after he had quitted
the courtyard, and begun to descend
from Mount Zion to the labyrinth of
streets branching downward to the
Tyropæon Valley. In one of these,
under a bright moonlight, he met
again that same beautiful youth whom
he had seen in the morning when he
was descending the Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>"Stay!" cried Paulus, suddenly
stopping in his own rapid walk. "Said
you not, this morning, that he who
was called 'John the Baptist' was
more than a prophet? Herod has
this moment slain him, to please a
vile woman. The tyrant has sent
the holy prophet out of life."</p>

<p>"Nay; into life," replied the other
John; "but, brave and noble Roman&mdash;for
I see you are both&mdash;the Master,
who knows all things, and rejoices
that John has begun to live, grieves
as well."</p>

<p>"Why grieves?" inquired Paulus,
musing.</p>

<p>"Because," replied the other John,
"the Master is verily man, no less
than <em>He is Who is</em>."</p>

<p>"What, then, is he?" asked Paulus,
with a look of awe.</p>

<p>"He is the Christ, whom John
the Prophet, now a witness unto
death, had announced."</p>

<p>Hereupon the two went their several
ways, Paulus muttering: "<i>The
second name in the acrostic.</i>"</p>

<p>But, really, he had ceased to care
for minor coincidences in a huge
mass of convergent proofs all gaining
possession of his soul, and taking
alike his will and his understanding
captive&mdash;captive to the irresistible
truth and the equally irresistible beauty
of the message which had come.
The immortality of which he was an
heir, the reader has seen him long
since believing; and long since also
rejecting both the pantheism of the
philosophers and the polytheism of
the vulgar. And here was a great
new doctrine authoritatively establishing
all that the genius of Dionysius
had guessed, and infinitely more;
truths awful and mysterious, which
offered immediate peace to that stupendous
universe that is within a
man, while assuring him of power,
joy, and honor to begin some day,
and nevermore to end.</p>

<p>He had not been in Jerusalem long
before he learnt much of the new
teaching. He had secured for his
mother, close to the Fortress Antonio,
where he himself lodged, a small
house belonging to a widow who,
since her husband's death, had fallen
into comparative poverty. The Lady
Aglais, attended still by her old
freedwoman, Melena, was allowed
the best and coolest part of this
house entirely to herself, with a staircase
of their own leading to the flat
roof. There they passed much of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
their evenings after the sun had set,
looking at the thickly-built opposite
hills, the mansions on Zion, or down into
the Tyropæon from which the hum
of a great multitude came, mellowed by
the distance, and disposing the mind
to contemplation. Many wonderful
things, from time to time, they heard
of him who was now teaching&mdash;things
some of which, nay, the greater
part of which, as one of the sacred
writers expressly declares, never
were recorded, and the whole of
which could not be contained in the
libraries of the world. It may well,
then, be imagined in what a situation
Paulus and his mother were&mdash;having
no interest in disbelieving, no chair
of Moses to abdicate, no doctorial
authority or pharisaic prestige inciting
them to impugn the known truth&mdash;in
what a situation they were, for
accepting or declining what was then
offered.</p>

<p>After twenty years of separation, a
trace of Esther had been recovered
by Paulus. One evening, his mother
was on the flat roof of her residence
awaiting his customary visit, when
her son appeared and alarmed her
by his pallor. He had seen Esther
on foot in a group of women at the
Gate of Gennath, going forth into
the country, as he was entering the
city on horseback. Aglais smiled
sadly, saying: "Alas! dear son,
is that all? I long since knew that
she still lived; but I would not disturb
your mind by the useless intelligence."</p>

<p>"Scarcely altered," murmured Paulus
abstractedly, "while I am quite
old. Yes, she must now be past thirty;
yes, near thirty-five."</p>

<p>"As to that," said the mother,
"you are thirty-eight, and scarcely
seem twenty-nine. Old Rebecca, the
mistress of this house, who lives still
in the ground-story, as you are aware,
has told me much about Esther."</p>

<p>"She is married, I suppose," said
Paulus, with a look of anxiety.</p>

<p>"No," replied Aglais. "She has
had innumerable offers (spite of her
comparative poverty), and has declined
them all."</p>

<p>"But what boots it?" exclaimed
Paulus.</p>

<p>"Old Josiah Maccabeus is dead,"
said Aglais. And here mother and son
dropped the subject by mutual consent.</p>

<p>The dreadful days, closed by the
most awful day the world has known&mdash;closed
by the ever-memorable and
tremendous Friday&mdash;came and went.
On the Saturday, Paulus met Longinus,
who said he had been on Mount
Calvary that afternoon, and that he,
Longinus, was now and ever henceforth
a disciple of him who had
been crucified. The Sunday came,
and brought with it a prodigious rumor,
which, instead of dying out,
found additional believers every day.
The disciples, most of whom had
shown themselves as timid as they
were known to be ignorant, now
seemed transformed into new characters,
who loudly affirmed that their
Master had risen from the dead by
his own power; and they were ready
to face every torment and all terrors
calmly in the maintenance of
this fact, which they predicted would
be received and acknowledged by
the whole world. And, indeed, it
was no longer a rumor, but a truth,
attested by the only witnesses who
could by possibility know anything
about it, either for or against; and
whose earthly interests it would have
been to deny it, even while they knew
it to be true&mdash;witnesses who, if they
knew it to be false&mdash;and they certainly
knew whether it were true or
false (this much was granted, <em>and is
still granted</em>, by all their opponents)&mdash;could
have had no motive, either
earthly or unearthly, for feigning that
they believed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>So pregnant is this simple reasoning,
that a man might ponder it and
study it for a whole month, and yet
find fresh strength and an ever-increasing
weight in the considerations
which it suggests; not even find a
flaw if he made the one month
twelve. Paulus's mind was determined,
and so was his mother's.
The son sought that same beautiful
youth whom he had seen twice before;
told him the new desire, the
new belief, which had made his
mother's and his own heart glad;
and by him they were baptized as
Christians, disciples of him that had
been crucified&mdash;by that fair youth, I
say, who was to be known for ever
among men as "Saint John the
Evangelist."</p>

<p>"After all, mother," said Paulus,
when they were returning together
to her dwelling, "it is not so very
mysterious; I mean that difficulty
about the lowliness of our divine
Teacher's chosen place among men.
Because, see you, if the builder of
those glorious stars and that sublime
firmament was to come at all
amongst us, he would be certain
to take the lowest and smallest lot,
lest we should deem there was any
difference as before him. We are all
low and small together&mdash;the earth
itself, I am told, being but a sort of
Bethlehem among the stars; but,
anyhow, we are but mites and emmets
on a blade of grass in his sight,
and had he taken a great relative
place amidst us, it might countenance
the lie and the delusion of our silly
pride. That part of it is to me not
so mysterious, although I don't wonder
at the Jewish notion that their
Messiah was to have been a great
conquering prince&mdash;that is probably
what the Antichrist will be. It
would suit the blindness of vanity
better."</p>

<p>As he spoke the words, they heard
a quick footstep behind, and were
overtaken by Longinus, who, saying
he had just heard of their reception,
greeted them with every demonstration
of rapturous affection.</p>

<p>"Now," pursued he, walking by
their side, "good for evil to Master
Paulus's family. Forgive the apparent
intrusion, dear general, if I mention
that I happen to know the story
of your youthful love, as all the world
have witnessed your fidelity to an unavailing
attachment. But learn from
poor Longinus that Esther Maccabeus
is now a disciple; and the
Christian maiden can wed, under a
still holier law, the brave Gentile
whom the Jewess was bound to refuse."</p>

<p>With this he turned into an alley
under the court of the Gentiles, and
disappeared.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXVI.</h3>

<p>One still and sultry evening, the
decline of a brooding day in spring,
two persons were sitting on the flat
roof of a house in Jerusalem. They
were the Athenian Lady Aglais and
her son, the comparatively youthful
Roman General Paulus&mdash;he who has
so largely figured, even from his gallant
boyhood, in the events and affairs
we have been recording.</p>

<p>It was the 30th of March, and a
Wednesday&mdash;the first of all Easter-Wednesdays&mdash;the
first in that new
and perpetual calendar by which,
throughout the fairest regions of
earth, among all enlightened nations
and civilized races, till the crash of
doom, time was for evermore to be
measured.</p>

<p>A servant, carrying a skin-cask
slung over his shoulders, was watering
the flowers, faint with thirst;
and these, arranged in fanciful vases,
which made an artificial garden of
the housetop, shook their drooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
heads under the fresh and grateful
shower, and seemed to answer it
with smiles of a thousand blooms
and rays. As the man stole softly
to and fro about the roof, now approaching
the lady and her son, now
receding, he seemed, in spite of the
foreign language in which they spoke,
and in spite of the low and hushed
tone they observed, to follow, with intense
and breathless though stealthy
excitement, the tenor of their conversation;
while his figure, in the last
evening rays, cast a long, shifting
shadow that streaked with black the
yellow flood to its farthest limit,
climbed the parapet, broke upon
its grail-work of balusters, and then
was beheaded, for it flung off its
head out of sight into empty space,
leaving the calm bright air unblotted
above the stone guard-wall.</p>

<p>An occurrence took place of which
(that Wednesday evening) Paulus and
his mother were witnesses&mdash;an occurrence
in dumb show, the significance
of which they were destined, only
after several years, to learn; yet the
incident was so singular, so strange,
so impressive&mdash;it was such a picture
in such a quarter&mdash;that when, long
subsequently, the explanation came,
they seemed to be still actually assisting
in person at the scene which,
while they beheld it, they had no
means of understanding. We are
going, in one moment, to relate that
occurrence; and we must here request
the reader to grant us his full
belief and his confidence when we
remark that, in comparison of his
amusement, his profit, and that mental
gallery of pictures to be his henceforth
(which we try to give to all who
honor these pages with a perusal), we
feel the sincerest contempt for any
mere display of scholarship or learning.
For this reason, and this reason
alone, and certainly from no
scantiness, and still less from any
lack of authorities, we shall almost
disencumber our narrative of references
to the ancient writers and recondite
documents (such as the <cite>Astronomic
Formula of Philip Aridæus</cite>)
which establish as positive historical
facts the more striking of the occurrences
still to be mentioned. In one
instance the intelligent reader will
discern that the most sacred of all
evidence supports what we have to
record. But if we were to show with
what nicety of precision much profane,
yet respectable and even venerable,
testimony accords with the
passage here meant in the Acts of
the Apostles, and how abundantly
such testimony corroborates and supplements
the inspired account, this
book would cease to be what it aims
at being, and would become a historical
treatise of the German criticism
school.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Satisfied, therefore, with the footnotes
below (at which the reader will
oblige us by just glancing, and which
are appended, in perfect good faith
and simple honesty, as implying no
more than we could make good), we
will avoid boring those who have a
right to, and who expect, the conclusion
of a straightforward story at our
hands.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Paulus and his mother were conversing,
as has been described, in
Greek, while the serving-man, despite
his ignorance of that language, had
the air of half-following the drift of
what they said, and of catching the
main purport of it with wonder and
awe. There was, indeed, at that
moment, only one topic in all Jerusalem.
He who, less than a week
ago, had been crucified, and with the
time of whose coming (as much as
with all the particulars of his life,
teaching, works, and death) the old
prophecies were found more and
more startlingly, circumstantially,
unmistakably, the more they were
studied, questioned, and canvassed,
to agree, point by point, down to
what would seem even trivial details
(indicated as if merely to emphasize
the incommunicable identity
of the Messiah)&mdash;he had himself
stated, distinctly and publicly, that,
by his own power, he would rise from
the dead in three days; that, in three
days after, he should be "lifted up"
and be made "a spectacle for men
and angels;" in three days after they
should have destroyed it, he would
rebuild the holy temple of his body.
And now these rumors&mdash;these minute,
these positive accounts&mdash;had
he, then, really reappeared, according
to his word and promise?
Was it possible? Was it the
fact?</p>

<p>Many had, on the previous Friday
night, stated that, of a verity, they
had seen their deceased parents and
relatives. Again, on the Saturday,
many declared, amid awe-stricken
groups of listeners, that the unknown
land had sent them its visitants, in
various places, under various aspects,
to startle the guilty city; which, after
killing the King's messenger-servants,
had just killed the King's Son, who
had come, as had been a thousand
times announced, in the very fulness,
the exact maturity of days, to deliver
the final embassy to men.</p>

<p>On that Wednesday evening, there
was, in truth, but one theme of conversation,
one subject of thought, all
through Jerusalem, and already far
beyond Jerusalem; among poor and
rich, high and low, natives and strangers,
the robbers of the Syrian hills
and Arabian deserts, the dwellers in
the city, the travellers on the roads
and at the inns, among Sadducees,
Pharisees, Romans, Greeks, Egyptians,
and barbarians.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, if the humble
serving-man, as he watered the flowers,
penetrated the drift of the mother's
and the son's discussion. For
him and such as he was the message.
The poor Syrian had once, for a
while, rendered occasional out-door
service to the family of Lazarus; and
he had known Lazarus in three states&mdash;had
known him living, dead, again
alive. After days of death in that
fierce climate, where inanimate flesh
putrefies fast, he had beheld Lazarus,
at the call of one upon whose lineaments
he gazed, at the time, with unconscious
adoration, come forth, not
merely from death, but from incipient
decomposition, back into balmy
life&mdash;back to the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">vita serena</span>."</p>

<p>Now, was he who, in that instance,
had allowed it to be perceived and
felt that he was really the Lord of
life, whom death and rottenness were
manifestly unable to disobey&mdash;was he
himself, as his disciples declared he
was, living again among them, since
the morning of the last Sunday (the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feria prima</i>), according to his own
public prediction and distinct promise?
Was he not? Was he?</p>

<p>Aglais and Paulus had heard more
than one circumstantial account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
this, his reappearance, according to
that, his promise. By this one and
by the other he had been met. They
had gazed upon him, spoken to him,
heard him in reply, touched him, in
such a place, on that bridge, that road,
in such a garden. He had walked conversing
with them, had sat with them
at meat, had broken bread with them,
as was his wont, had then vanished.</p>

<p>Where was his body, over which
the Pharisees had set their guard of
soldiers? Not in the grave. No;
but where? Had the Pharisees accounted
for it? Could they tell what
had become of it? Could the soldiers?
The disciples could, and they
did.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Paulus, "do you
know what those soldiers say? One
of them once served in a legion
which I commanded. Do you know
what they say?"</p>

<p>"You mean," replied Aglais,
"about their inability to hinder
the abstraction. What?"</p>

<p>"That an act to which they are
the only witnesses could not be
stopped by them, because of it they
were not witnesses, being buried in
sleep."</p>

<p>"Consistent," said the Greek lady.
"Yes; but a much weightier fact is
that expectation of the disciples, to
prevent the realization of which the
Pharisees set their guard."</p>

<p>"What expectation? And why
weightier? What can be weightier?"
asked the general.</p>

<p>"That their Master would keep
his word, and fulfil his prediction of
rising from the tomb on the third
day. If they saw him again alive
within the promised time, they and
the people would worship him as
God; but, if the Pharisees could
show the body on the third day, or
could even account for it, that belief
would die."</p>

<p>"Clearly," answered Paulus, "the
disciples expected to see him again
on and after the third day, waiting
for his word to be fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Now, Paulus," pursued Aglais,
"suppose this expectation of theirs
not fulfilled; suppose that not one of
those waiting for his word was conscious
of any reason for believing it
to have been realized&mdash;"</p>

<p>Paulus interrupted his mother.</p>

<p>"There is only one possible way in
which they could be induced to believe
it realized&mdash;namely, that he
should be seen again alive."</p>

<p>"Quite so," she resumed. "But
suppose that he has not been seen;
suppose that not one of those who
expected to see him again has thus
seen him. How would they then
feel on this Wednesday morning?"</p>

<p>"They would feel that the expectation
which he had solemnly and
publicly authorized them to depend
upon was idle and vain; they would
not and could not by any possibility
feel that they had, in this great particular,
reason to consider his word
to have been kept. They would be
discouraged to the very last degree.
They would, of course, hide themselves.
I would do so myself, and I
believe I am no coward. In short,
they would feel no reason to hope in
his protection, or to expect that his
other and still mightier promises concerning
their own future eternal life
would by him be realized. They
would not incur any inconvenience,
or brave any danger, or take any
trouble, or risk any loss&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Aglais's turn to interrupt.</p>

<p>"Now, is this their attitude?" she
inquired.</p>

<p>"The reverse, the opposite, the
contradictory of their attitude."</p>

<p>The lady continued in a low tone:
"If, expecting, upon his own assurance,
that some among them should
see him," she asked, "not one of
them had seen him, would they, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
this moment, have any motive for
bringing upon themselves the tortures,
insults, shame, and death which
he underwent, and all this in order to
induce others to believe apparitions
and a resurrection which in their
own hearts they did not themselves
believe, and for believing which they
were, moreover, conscious that they
possessed no ground, no reason, no
pretext?"</p>

<p>A sweet, ringing, vibrant voice at
their side here said:</p>

<p>"And in order by deliberate circumstantial
lying, of an awful and
blasphemous kind, to please the God
of truth; and to compensate themselves
by his protection above, in a
future life, for the present and immediate
destruction which they are incurring
among the Pharisees and the
men of power here below!"</p>

<p>Looking round, they beheld Esther
of the Maccabees.</p>

<p>Never had she seemed to Paulus
so beautiful; but there was a marked
change; for, however intellectual had
always been the translucent purity of
that oval brow, through which, as
through a lamp of alabaster, shone
the vivid mind within, there was now
the mysterious effluence of "that
Essence increate" who had come to
abide in, and had strangely transfigured
the appearance of, the faithful-souled
Hebrew maiden. And when
Paulus, after she had embraced his
mother, abstractedly took her hand,
his heart was lifted upward with a
species of wonder; and, without adverting
to it, he was asking himself
to what marvellous kingdom she had
become heiress, in what supernal
court of everlasting joy and unassailable
prerogatives was this beautiful
creature destined to live, loving
and beloved, adorning almost the
glories which she reflected, dispensed,
and multiplied, as if from some holy,
mysterious, and spiritual mirror.</p>

<p>"O dear Lady Aglais! and O
legatus!" she said, with a gesture
amazing in its expressiveness and pathetic
fervor (she had brought the
finger-tips of both hands together
under the chin, and then lowered
them with the palms outward toward
her hearers, and so she stood in an
attitude of the utmost grace and dignity
combined, like one appealing to
the candor and good faith of others)&mdash;"O
dear friends! I was just now
passing through my own garden on
my way hither, when, under the fig-tree
(where he used to sit poring
over the holy books of our people),
I beheld my dead father, but standing,
and not in his old accustomed
wicker-chair; and he gazed upon me
with large, earnest eyes; and as he
stood, his head almost touched the
leaves of that hollow, embowering fig-tree;
and he was pale, so extremely
pale as he was never during life;
and he called me: 'Esther,' he
said, and his voice sounded far
away. Ah! my God, from what a
huge distance it seemed to come!
And lo! lady, and thou, legatus, he
said these words to me: 'I have
been in the vast, dim house, and have
seen our Father Abraham; and I
have seen our great Lawgiver, and
all our prophets, excepting only two,
Elias and Enoch; and I asked, Where
were they? And in all the dim, vast
house none answered me, but the
forefinger was pressed to the silent
lips of those who there waited. And,
suddenly, there was the noise of innumerable
armies coming swiftly from
afar&mdash;but your ears are mortal and
your eyes veiled, and were I even permitted
to tell you that which shook, beyond
this little world, the large world
and its eternal thrones, your mind would
not at present understand my words.
Enough, Esther, that I have been
allowed to renew to you, in my own
behalf, and that of others among our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
people who have been called before
you to the vast, dim, silent city, the
exhortation which our ancestor Judas
Maccabeus sent with offerings to the
high-priest; namely, that you will
pray for our spirits. Our innumerable
company has just been thinned;
the glorious Judas Maccabeus, our
ancestor, and that holy mother of
the Maccabees, and almost all who
were waiting with me in the dim,
vast kingdom of expectation, have
gone for ever; and I, and a few,
have been commanded to expect yet
a little time; until the incense of
holy prayer shall have further gone
up in the presence of the Great White
Throne.'"</p>

<p>Esther paused, her eyes dilated,
and stood a moment with the hands
again brought together; and so perfect
a figure of truthfulness, and such
an impersonation of sincerity, she
looked, that the Jewish servant, who
understood not a word of the tongue
in which she addressed the Greek
lady and her son, gazed at her; his
work suspended, his cask held high
in air, with all the marks of one who
heard and accepted some sacred and
unquestionable revelation.</p>

<p>"Go on, dear child," said Aglais.
"What passed further?"</p>

<p>"I asked the pale image what
this meant, that he should term the
condition in which he is waiting and
has yet to wait a little time&mdash;that
vast, dim condition&mdash;'a house,' 'a
city,' and 'a kingdom.' 'The dwellers,'
he replied, 'are watched in that
kingdom by silent protectors, mighty
and beautiful, whose faces, full of a
severe, sad love, are the torches and
the only light those dwellers ever
see; and the vast, dim city has a
sunless and a starless sky for its roof,
under which they wait; and that sky
is the ceiling which echoes the sighs
of their pain; and thus to them it
has been a kingdom, and a city, and
a house; and, until the ninth hour
of last Friday, they were numerous
as the nations of men!' 'And at the
ninth hour of that day, I asked, 'O
my father! what occurred when so
many departed, and you and a small
number were left still to wait?' And
he gazed at me for an instant with a
wan and wistful look; then, lo! I
saw nothing where he had been
standing under the fig-tree.</p>

<p>"But it was at the ninth hour of
the last Friday the Master had expired
by the side of the penitent who
was that very day to be with him in
paradise!" cried Aglais.</p>

<p>At Esther's arrival, Paulus and Aglais
had both risen from a kind of
semicircular wicker settle which occupied
one of the corners of the
roof; and they now, all three, when
Esther had finished her strange, brief
narrative, leaned silent and musing
against the parapet; where, under
the shade of a clustering rhododendron,
they had a view westward
(drawn, as people are who ponder,
toward whatever object is most luminous)
of the towers and palaces
and pinnacles of the Holy City, then
reddening in the sunset. One word
respecting the spot where the little
group was thus collected, and (among
modern, and especially western, nations)
concerning its peculiar scenic
effects.</p>

<p>The roof was an irregular parallelogram,
protected on all sides by a
low, thick parapet, at two opposite
corners of which, in the diagonals,
were two doors of masonry, bolted
with massive round bars of iron, or
left open; thus excluding or admitting
communication with the contiguous
houses. The writer, many years ago,
saw such parapet doors on the house-tops
of modern Algiers; nor was the
arrangement unknown in the more
famous Eastern cities of antiquity,
where the roofs glowed with plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
in vases. When, on some public
occasion, the passages were opened,
the richer inhabitants, far above the
noise, dust, squalor, sultriness, and
comparative darkness of the narrow
and noisome streets, could stroll and
lounge for miles, in mid-air, among
flowers; could cross even flying and
embowered bridges (of which a privileged
number possessed the keys,
like those who have keys to the
gardens of our squares); and so
Dives, unseen of Lazarus, but seeing
far down all things little and supine,
could wander through parterres of
bloom, and perfumed alleys, and
shrubberies of enchantment, with effects
of sunlight sprinkled, so to
speak, with coolness and with
shadows, soothed out of the noonday
fierceness into tints various and
tender; unsoiled of the stains and
pains that stained and pained the
poor sordid world below; until the
hearts of those who thus promenaded
amid circumstances of such delicious
refinement and luxury, bearing and
hearing news, and exchanging civilities,
were "lifted up," and became
even like to the heart of Nabuchodonosor
the king. Sometimes the
pecten-beaten dulcimer, or the fingered
lyre of six strings, made long-forgotten
airs of music beguile the
declining day, and linger for hours
longer, ravishing the night under the
stars of the Syrian sky. Such the
scene.</p>

<p>But none of the roof-doors were
open that Wednesday evening.
Something ailed the Holy City.
Out of the hushed heavens, mysteries
and a stern doom were brooding
over Jerusalem. Already the fermenting
germ of those dreadful factions
which were to tear to pieces,
with intestine rage, the whole Jewish
body, while the city was writhing in
the vain death-struggle against Titus,
a few years later, had begun to make itself
sensible to the observant. A fierce
hatred of the Romans and an insane
eagerness to re-establish the old Jewish
independence had taken possession
of certain youthful fanatics; and "possessed"
indeed they seemed. On the
one side, the Roman officers of the
garrison, from Pilate down, had received
anonymous warnings, in the
wildest style, requiring them to withdraw
from Jerusalem within a given
time, or they should be all executed
in the streets, as opportunity might
occur; on the other, the prefect of
Syria had been earnestly requested
by Pilate to strengthen the garrison;
while in the city itself the soldiers
were strictly admonished to keep to
their quarters, to avoid late hours,
and to hold no intercourse when off
duty with the inhabitants. Leaves
of absence were stopped. A few
legionaries had been already murdered
in the neighborhood of wine-shops,
in the small winding alleys,
and in places of evil repute, and no
efforts succeeded in identifying the
perpetrators.</p>

<p>But these were only the feeble and
evanescent symptoms, destined to
disappear and reappear, of a political
and social phase which was not to
become the predominant situation
until another situation should have
exhausted its first fury. This, the
first, was to be the war of the Synagogue
against the disciples of the
Messiah, whom those disciples went
about declaring to have risen from
the tomb, according to his distinct
promise; whom they went about declaring
to have been already seen,
and heard, and touched by themselves,
again and again.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, if Aglais and
Paulus and Esther had discussed in
hushed tones and in Greek the
wonders and various portents attendant
upon the supreme and central
fact&mdash;that Resurrection of the Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which absorbed their whole
hearts and minds, leaving no room
for any other interest therein at this
tremendous epoch&mdash;the grand turning-point
of human destinies and of
our whole planet's history.</p>

<p>From the parapet against which
they were leaning, they now gazed in
silence upon the splendid scenes
below and opposite. Across a maze
of narrow streets they saw the mansions,
the pinnacles, the towers, and
that great supernal "Temple of God,"
all so soon to perish violently, in a
general, a complete, and an irreversible
destruction. They saw the
play of light and shadow upon one
long tree-lined side of Herod's proud
palace; they saw the ripple of quivering
leaves reflected upon the white
colonnades (and their tessellated,
shady floors) of Pilate's fatal house;
and, while revolving thoughts and
questions of unspeakable importance
and solemnity, they all three suddenly
beheld an acted picture, a passing
scene, voiceless to them, yet impressive,
which blent itself into their
recollection of other scenes, never to
be effaced from the memory of mankind,
which, not a week before, had
been under those very colonnades
enacted.</p>

<p>A woman in the attire of a Roman
matron came quickly forth upon the
first-story balcony in the house of
Pontius Pilate, and, leaning over the
rail, waved her hand with an imperative
gesture to some one below.</p>

<p>She was followed into the balcony
more slowly by a man wearing the
grand costume of an ancient Roman
military governor, who held in his
hand a sealed and folded letter, tied
with the usual silk string. The man
was evidently Pilate himself. He
looked long and gloomily at the letter,
and seemed to be plunged in
thought. He even let what he carried
fall at his feet, and did not appear
to be aware of this for some
moments. It was the woman who
picked up the letter, and gave it back
into his hand. Then Pilate leaned
over the balustrade, in his turn, and
spoke to a man below in military
costume, who was mounted on a
powerful horse, and seemed to be
equipped for travel. The soldier
saluted, looking up, when he was addressed,
and saluted again when his
superior had ceased speaking; whereupon
Pilate dropped the letter (a
large and heavy dispatch), which
the soldier caught and secured under
his belt, inside the tunic, or "sagum,"
immediately afterward riding away
at a canter. Our three friends saw
Pilate, his head bent and his eyes on
the ground, slowly and ponderingly
re-enter the house by a screen-door,
the same through which he had come
out upon the balcony; but the lady,
clasping her hands a little in front of
her forehead, gazed into the heavens
with a face ashy pale, and with eyes
from which tears were streaming.</p>

<p>It is a well-known and for centuries
universally received tradition,
besides being a fact recorded by one
most respectable and trustworthy
author (who, besides, was not a Christian,
but a Jew)&mdash;a fact without
which the allusions to it in various
ancient authorities, together with
Phlegon the Chronologer's subsequent
recital of Tiberius's extraordinary
conduct, would be unintelligible
and unaccountable&mdash;that Pontius
Pilate, harassed by the unappeasable
reproaches of his wife, and stung by
something within his own bosom
which allowed him peace no more,
until (sleepless, and unable again,
unable for ever, to sleep) he bequeathed,
some years afterward, by
an awful death, whether intentional
or not, his name to a great Alpine
hill, a hill not thenceforth named, or
to be named, while time and mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
last, by any name but "Pilate's"
among distant and then barbarous
nations&mdash;it is well known, I say, that
Pilate sent to Tiberius Cæsar a long
and minute relation concerning the
life, the death, and the disappearance
from the tomb of him whom he had
scourged, and whom the Jews had
crucified, together with a notice of
the supernatural wonders wrought by
him; his previous notorious announcement
of his own intended
resurrection; the directly consequent
and equally notorious precautions
taken to hinder it; the disappearance,
in spite of this, of the body;
the testimony of the soldiers that
they were witnesses <em>to</em> the abstraction,
which they were unable to stop,
because they alleged that they were
not witnesses <em>of</em> it (being buried in
sleep); that, in fact, their testimony
proved nothing save the body's disappearance
from the massively-sealed
tomb (which would have stood a
small siege); the failure of the Synagogue
to account for the body; the
account of it by the disciples; and,
finally, the admissions of the Pharisees
that all their prophets had become
unexplainable if this was not their
Messiah, yet that such a conclusion
was to them impossible, because he
was to have been their king, and a
conquering king, and to have founded
an empire extending through all
nations and tongues; their stern and
ever-growing disaffection to the Roman
rule; the universal amazement,
excitement, and anxiety arising from
the circumstance that, while neither
the Synagogue nor the soldiers could
throw any light upon what had become
of the body, the disciples of
him who had predicted his own resurrection
explained the event openly
and fearlessly by stating that they
had again and again met him since
the previous <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">feria prima</i>; that they
cared for no protection except his
alone; that the dead was once more
among them&mdash;living, and henceforth
immortal&mdash;their Master and God;
the ultimate Judge of this world, and
the foretold Founder of an everlasting
kingdom! Pilate added several
strange and astounding particulars.</p>

<p>This, in a general way, is known;
and it is likewise known that Tiberius
Cæsar was so deeply impressed by
the dispatch of the Jerusalem governor,
arriving in his hands about the
same moment, as we shall find in the
next chapter, when a strange incident
(<i>narrated by Plutarch</i>) took
place, that he suddenly convened the
senate in a formal indiction, <i>and proposed
to them to raise a temple to
Christ, and to rank him solemnly
among the gods of the empire</i>! But
not such nor of such acknowledgments
was to be the kingdom of the
"jealous" and the only God.</p>

<p>Aglais, Paulus, and Esther had
assisted at a memorable pantomime.
They had beheld the mounted soldier
who rode with a memorable
letter to the sea-coast; they had seen
the vain effort of him who had offered
the people a choice between Barabbas
and "the desired of nations," to
call the great of the earth into his
perplexities, to quiet his awakened
conscience, to turn aside from the
dread warnings whispered to his soul,
to lull&mdash;by futile means&mdash;an all too
late remorse.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXVII.</h3>

<p>In our last chapter, Paulus and
his Athenian mother had obtained,
through Esther's recital of her waking
dream or vision, one little glimpse
at that prison, that place of detention,
which she had termed (as she herself
had heard it termed) "the dim, vast
house," "the vast, dim city," and the
"dim, vast kingdom."</p>

<p>The vague notion she could give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of that scene of immurement cannot
be expected to prove interesting to so
large a number, as Mr. Pickwick has
cause to feel an interest in his
glimpses of the "Fleet Prison," once
famous in London. But such interest
as the former house of detention
commands is of a different
kind, and those who may experience
it are a different class. Plato (as a
great critic observes) has been translated
from age to age into some dozen
great modern languages, in order
that he might be read by about a
score of persons in each generation.
But that score are the little fountains
of the large rivers that bear to the
sea the business of the world. Few
are directly taught by Kant, Sir William
Hamilton, John Stuart Mill,
Cousin, or Balmez; but the millions
are taught and think through those
whom <em>they</em> have taught to think.
Between the good and evil originators
or conservators of ideas, and
the huge masses who do all their
mental processes at third hand, stand
the interpreters; and these listen
with bent heads, while they hold
trumpets which are heard at the
extremities of the earth.</p>

<p>Paulus lingered in Jerusalem.
Weeks flew by. Spring passed into
summer; summer was passing into
autumn; and still, from time to time,
as, in the evenings, mother and son
sat among the flowers on the flat
roof, Esther would join them.</p>

<p>One night, she had hardly appeared,
when Longinus the centurion followed
her, bearing a letter for Paulus,
which, he said, had just arrived at
Fort Antonio, by the hands of an
orderly, from the governor. The
letter was from Dionysius of Athens,
now <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'un des quarante</i>, a member of
that great Areopagus of which the
French Academy is partly a modern
image; and it was written immediately
after his return from a tour in
Egypt, and a cruise through the
Ægean Sea, among the famous and
beautiful Greek Islands, to resume
his duties as a teacher of philosophy
and a professor of the higher literature
at Athens.</p>

<p>Paulus, after a word with his
mother and Esther, desired Longinus
to favor them with his company.
Sherbets and other refreshments were
brought. They all sat down on the
semicircular wicker settle at the
corner of the roof, under the bower-like
branches of the large rhododendron;
a small lamp was held for
Paulus by the Jewish serving-man,
and Paulus read the letter aloud to
that sympathetic group. Extracts
we will give, in the substance, concerning
two occurrences. The first,
as the reader sees, the listening circle
learned from Dionysius; but <em>we</em>
have it in reality from Plutarch, upon
whose narrative Eusebius and many
other weighty authorities and grave
historians have commented.</p>

<p>The captain and owner (for he
was both) of the vessel in which
Dion sailed back from Egypt to
Athens was an Egyptian of the
name of Thramnus (some call him
Thamus). He said that a very
weird thing had happened to him
in his immediately previous trip,
which had been from Greece to Italy.
Dion was at the time at Heliopolis,
in Egypt, with his friend, the celebrated
philosopher Apollophanes,
who, though (like Dion himself)
only between twenty and thirty, had
already (in this also resembling
Dion) obtained an almost world-wide
fame for eloquence, astronomical science,
and general learning. When
Thramnus had neared the Echinades
Islands, the wind fell, a sudden calm
came, and they had to drop anchor
near Paxos. The night was sultry;
every one was on deck. Suddenly,
from the lonely shore, a loud, strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
voice hailed the captain: "Thramnus!"
it cried. None answered.
Again, louder than human, came the
cry, "Thramnus!" Still none answered.
For the third time, "Thramnus!"
was thundered from the lonely
coast. Then Thramnus himself
called out: "Who hails? What is
it?" Shrill and far louder than before
was the voice in reply: "When you
reach the Lagoon of Palus, announce
then that the Great Pan is dead."</p>

<p>Thereupon, everything became silent,
save the sluggish wash of the
waves under the vessel's side. A sort
of council was at once held on board;
and first they took a note of the
exact date and the hour. They
found that it was exactly the ninth
hour of the sixth <i>jeria</i>, or day, in
the month of March, in the fourth
year (according with Phlegon's corrected
and checked astronomical
chronology) of the two hundred and
second Olympiad: in other words,
this, being translated into modern
reckoning, means, six in the afternoon
of Friday, the 25th of March,
in the thirty-third year of our Lord.</p>

<p>Dion breaks off in his letter here to
remark: "You will learn presently
what happened to me and to Apollophanes,
and to the whole renowned
city of Heliopolis, at the same hour
exactly of that same day; and it is
the coincidence between the two
occurrences which has fixed them so
deeply in my mind."</p>

<p>Well; he proceeds to say that
Thramnus, having asked his passengers,
who happened to be unusually
numerous, whether they considered
he ought to obey this mysterious mandate,
and having suggested himself
that, if, on their reaching Palus, or
Pelodes, the wind held fair, they
should not lose time by stopping, but
if the wind were there to fail, and
they were forced to halt at that place,
then it might be no harm to pay attention
to the injunction, and see
what came of it, they were all unanimously
of his opinion. Thereupon,
as though by some design, in the
midst of a calm the breeze sprang up
freshly again, and they proceeded on
their way. When they came to the
indicated spot, all were again on deck,
unable to forget the strange incident
at Paxos; and, on a sudden, the
wind fell, and they were becalmed.</p>

<p>Thramnus, accordingly, after a
pause, leaned over the ship's side,
and, as loudly as he could, shouted
that <i>the great Pan was dead</i>. No
sooner had the words been pronounced
than all round the vessel
were heard a world of sighs issuing
from the deep and in the air, with
groans, and moanings, and long,
wild, bitter wailings innumerable,
as though from vast unseen multitudes
and a host of creatures plunged
in dismay and despair. Those on
board were stricken with amazement
and terror. When they arrived in
Rome, and were recounting the adventures
of their voyage, this wild
story sent its rumor far and near, and
made such an impression that it
reached the ears of Tiberius Cæsar,
who was then in the capital. He
sent for Thramnus and several of the
passengers, as Plutarch records for
us, particularly one, Epitherses, who
afterward, at Athens, with his son
Æmilianus, and the traveller Philip,
used often to tell the story till his
death. Tiberius, after ascertaining
the facts, summoned all the learned
men who chanced then to be in Rome,
and requested their opinion.</p>

<p>Their opinion, which is extant, matters
little. The holy fathers who
have investigated this occurrence are
divided in their views. It must be
remembered that Plutarch relates another
truly wonderful fact universal in
its range, as being notoriously simultaneous
with the singular local adventure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
above described&mdash;the sudden
silence of Delphi, and all the other
famous pagan oracles, from the 8th
day before the Kalends of April, in the
202d Olympiad, at six <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> At that
hour, on that day (March 25, Friday,
Anno Domini 33), those oracles
were stricken dumb, and nevermore
returned answers to their votaries.
Coupling these phenomena together,
in presence of a thousand other portents,
the holy fathers think, one
party of them, that the enemy of
man and of God, and that enemy's
legions, were grieving and wailing,
at the hour which Plutarch specifies
(the time of evening, and on the very
day, when our Lord died), at the
redemption just then consummated;
others, that the Almighty permitted
nature "to sigh through all her
works," in sympathy with the voluntary
sufferings of her expiring
Lord.</p>

<p>"Now, hearken," proceeded Dion
in his letter, "to how I was occupied,
hundreds of miles away, in Heliopolis,
at the time, the very hour of the
very day, when so wild and weird a
response came from the powers of the
air and the recesses of the deep to
those who shouted forth, amid a calm
on the silent breast of the Ægean
Sea, that the great Pan ('the great
All,' 'the universal Lord,' as you,
my friends, are aware it means in
Greek) had died!</p>

<p>"I had gone out, shortly before the
sixth hour on this sixth day, to take a
stroll in the tree-shaded suburbs of
Heliopolis, with my friend Apollophanes.
Suddenly, the sun, in a horrible
manner, withdrew its light so
effectually that we saw the stars. It
was the time of the Hebrew Pasch,
and the season of the month when the
moon is at the full, and the period of
an eclipse, or of the moon's apparent
conjunction with the sun, was well
known not to be then; independently
of which, two unexampled and
unnatural portents, contrary to the
laws of the heavenly bodies, occurred:
first, the moon entered the sun's disc
<i>from the east</i>; secondly, when she
had covered the disc and touched
the opposite diameter, instead of passing
onward, <i>she receded</i>, and resumed
her former position in the sky. All
the astronomers will tell you that
these two facts, and also the time of
the eclipse itself, are equally in positive
deviation from the otherwise
everlasting laws of the sidereal or
planetary movements. I felt that
either this universal frame was perishing
or the Lord and Pilot of nature
was himself suffering; and I turned
to Apollophanes, and, 'O light of
philosophy, glass of science!' I
said, 'explain to me what this
means.'</p>

<p>"Before answering me, he required
that we should together apply the
astronomical rule, or formula, of
Philip Aridæus; after doing which
with the utmost care, he said: 'These
changes are supernatural; there is
some stupendous revolution or catastrophe
occurring in divine affairs,
affecting the whole of the Supreme
Being's creation.'</p>

<p>"You may be sure, my friends, that
we both took a careful note of the
hour, the day, the week, month, year;
and I intend to inquire everywhere
whether in other lands any similar
phenomena have appeared; and what
overwhelming, unexampled event can
have taken place on this little planet
of ours to bring the heavens themselves
into confusion, and coerce all
the powers of nature into so awful a
manifestation of sympathy or of horror."</p>

<p>He ended by conveying to Aglais
and Paulus the loving remembrance
of the Lady Damarais.</p>

<p>Aglais and her son and Esther
were spell-bound with amazement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
when this letter had been read; and
Paulus exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What will Dion say when he
hears that we also saw this very darkness
at the same moment; that the veil
of the Temple here has been rent in
twain; and that he who expired
amid these and so many other portents,
Esther, and in the full culmination
of the prophecies, is again living,
speaking, acting, the Conqueror
of death, as he was the Lord of life?"</p>

<p>"Let us go to Athens; let us bring
our friends, the Lady Damarais and
our dear Dion, to learn and understand
what we have ourselves been
mercifully taught."</p>

<p>So spoke Aglais, offering at the
same time to Esther a mother's protection
and love along the journey.
Paulus was silent, but gazed pleadingly
at Esther.</p>

<p>It was agreed. But in the political
dangers of that reign, Paulus, owing
to his fame itself, had to take so
many precautions that much time
was unavoidably lost.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he had again asked
the Jewish maiden to become his
wife. Need we say that this time
his suit was successful? Paulus and
Esther were married.</p>

<p>Christianity in the interim grew
from month to month and from
year to year, and our wanderers had
but just arrived at last in Athens in
time to hear, near the statue of "the
unknown God," while Damarais, the
friend of Aglais, and Dion, the friend
of them all, stood near, a majestic
stranger, a Roman citizen, him who
had sat at the feet of Gamaliel, the
glorious Apostle of the Gentiles, who
had been "faithful to the heavenly
Vision," though he had not seen the
Resurrection, explain to the Athenians
"him whom they had ignorantly
worshipped." And when the
sublime messenger of glad tidings related
the circumstances of the Passion,
the scenes which had been
enacted in Pilate's house (so well remembered
by them), the next day's
dread event, and when he touched
upon the preternatural accompaniments
of that final catastrophe, and
described the darkness which had
overspread the earth from the sixth
hour of that day, Dionysius, turning
pale, drew out the tablets which he
carried habitually, examined the
date of which, at Heliopolis, he and
Apollophanes had jointly made note,
and showed symptoms of an emotion
such as he had never before experienced.</p>

<p>He and Damarais, as is well
known, were among the converts of
Saint Paul on that great occasion.
How our other characters felt we
need not describe.</p>

<p>Yielding to the entreaties of their
beloved Dionysius, they actually
loitered in Greece for a few years,
during which Christianity had outstripped
them and penetrated to
Rome, where it was soon welcomed
with fire and sword, and where
"the blood of martyrs became the
seed of Christians." Esther shuddered
as she heard names dear to
her in the murmured accounts of
dreadful torments.</p>

<p>Resuming their westward course,
how Paulus rejoiced that he had in
time sold everything in Italy, and
was armed with opulence in the
midst of new and strange trials!
They gave Italy a wide offing,
and passing round by the south of
Germany, with an armed escort
which Thellus (who had also become
a Christian, and had, while
they were in Greece, sent for Prudentia)
commanded, they never ceased
their travels till they reached the
banks of the Seine; and there, undiscernible
to the vision of Roman
tyranny in the distance, they obtained,
by means of the treasures they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
had brought, hundreds of stout
Gaulish hands to do their bidding,
and soon founded a peaceful home
amid a happy colony. Hence they
sent letters to Agatha and Paterculus.</p>

<p>Two arrivals from the realms of
civilization waked into excitement
the peaceful tenor of their days.
Paulus himself, hearing of the death
of Paterculus, ventured quickly back
to Italy, in the horrible, short reign
of Caligula, and fetched his sister
Agatha, now a widow, to live with
them. Later still, they were surprised
to behold arrive among them
one whom they had often mourned
as lost to them for ever. It was
Dionysius. He came to found
Christianity in Gaul, and settled,
amidst the friends of his youth, on
the banks of the Seine. Often they
reverted, with a clear light, to the
favorite themes of their boyhood;
and often the principal personages
who throughout this story have, we
hope, interested the reader, gathered
around that same Dionysius (who is,
indeed, the St. Denis of France),
and listened, near the place where
Notre Dame now towers, to the first
Bishop of Paris, correcting the theories
which he had propounded to the
Areopagus of Athens as the last of
the great Greek philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>One other arrival greeted, indeed,
the expatriated but happy settlement.
Longinus found his way among them;
and as the proud ideas of a social
system upon which they had turned
their back no longer tyrannized over
Aglais or Paulus, the brave man,
biding his time and watching opportunities,
found no insurmountable
obstacles in obtaining a fair reward
for twenty years and more of patient
and unalterable love. He and Agatha
were married.</p>

<h2>EUROPE'S FUTURE.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE GERMAN.</p>


<p>To be able to form a correct judgment
regarding the future of Europe,
there are several points and theories
which must be previously considered.
First on the list comes&mdash;</p>


<h3>I.<br />

THE RACE THEORY.</h3>

<p>"The key to the success of the
Prussian arms in the contest with
France is found in the decadence
of the Latin and the virility of the
German race. The Latin peoples
are corrupt; their star is waning;
their moral vigor is gone; while the
German nations are still young and
fresh. German culture, German
ideas, German muscle and energy,
are taking the place of the decrepit
French civilization. The German
victories are but the outward expression
of this historical process.
We are on the threshold of a new
epoch in the history of civilization&mdash;of
a new period which we can
appropriately call the German era."
Such is the theory which now possesses
the German mind, and is expressed
in the newspapers, pamphlets,
on the railroads, and in the inns all
through Germany, with great national
self-complacency. Even many Sclavonians
and Italians adopt this view.
The conquest of the Latin by the
Germanic races; the downfall of the
former; the world-wide sovereignty
of the latter&mdash;these are high-sounding
phrases which have a dramatic
effect and are popular in Germany.
But do they express a truth? Are
they philosophically and historically
correct in view of the actual condition
of political and social life? In
the first place, what and where are
the Latin races about which we have
been hearing so much during the past
ten years? The southern inhabitants
of the Italian peninsula can lay no
claim to Latin origin; for it is well
known that they were anciently
Greek colonies, which have since
intermarried with Romans, Spaniards,
and Normans. The Lombards
of the north of Italy are
mostly of Celtic and not of Latin
origin, since they inhabit the ancient
Gallia Cisalpina. The old Iberians
of Spain were not Latins; and they
are now mixed with Gothic, Moorish,
Celtic, and Basque blood. As for
France, its very name imports that
the Latins gave a very small contingent
towards forming a nation which
is certainly of Celtic and German
origin, and many of whose provinces
are purely of German race, as Alsace
and Lorraine. Where, then, shall
we find the Latin races?</p>

<p>There are none properly so-called.
Looking at the origin of languages,
we may, indeed, speak of Latin, or,
rather, of Roman nations. In this
regard, we may class the Italians,
Spaniards, Portuguese, and French
together, on account of the Roman
element prevailing in their tongues,
in opposition to the Scalavonic-German,
the Celtic-Anglo-Saxon-Danish-Norman
forming the world-wide
English, the Scandinavian, and the
pure Sclavonic families. Does this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
theory mean that nations of the same
tongue should all be politically and
socially united, flourish for a period,
and then perish together? Understood
in this way, the race theory
would have few defenders. It may
be true that nations, like individuals,
must live a definite period&mdash;rise,
flourish, and decay. It is
true, historically, that every nation
has an era of prosperity and an era
of decadence. But when we come
to the question of universal sovereignty,
we may ask, When did the
Roman nations ever exercise it?
Each of them has had its golden
age of literature, art, science, and material
prosperity; but none of them
has had, for any length of time, the
sovereignty of Europe. Not Italy,
for instance, unless we go back to the
days of old Rome, and then we have
not an Italian but a specifically Roman
supremacy. Not Spain, for although
she exercised great power beyond
the ocean, and for a time possessed
a preponderating influence in
Europe, from the reign of Charles V.
to the first successor of Philip II.,
yet who could call the accidental
union of so many crowns on the head
of a Hapsburg prince a universal
sovereignty for Spain? Lastly,
France had her age of glory during
the reign of Louis XIV., whose
influence, or that of the Napoleonic
era, cannot be denied. Yet what
gaps separate the reign of the great
King from that of the great Emperor!
Great as was France under
Louis XIV. and Bonaparte, she fell
to the second rank of nations during
the Restoration and under the July
dynasty. As leader in the Revolutionary
movement, she has always
controlled Europe, even in her periods
of political weakness, from the
days of the encyclopædists to the
present time. Even Germany acknowledges
the sway of French literature,
politeness, and taste. Victorious
Berlin copies the fashions and
manners of conquered France, as
ancient Rome, after conquering
Athens, became the slave of Athenian
civilization.</p>

<p>Germany, too, must have already
passed the period of her maturity, according
to the race theory; for, under
the Saxon Othos, under the Hohenstaufens,
and Charles V., until the
Thirty Years' War broke the strength
of the empire, she was superior even
to France. Does not German genius
in its peculiar walks rule the
world now? German science, German
music? Does not England, usually
considered as belonging to the
German race, rule the commerce of
the world? And was not her political
influence on the Continent until recently
all-powerful?</p>

<p>No! political sovereignty can be
explained by no race theory. From
the fall of the first Napoleon until
1848, England with the powers of
the "Holy Alliance," or rather with
Austria and Russia, held the first
place in European politics. From
the beginning of 1848 until the Crimean
war, England and Russia were
in the foreground; after that war it
was France and England; now it is
Prussia. These are but examples of
the political fluctuations which follow
each other in continual change, and
are seldom of long duration.</p>

<p>And do not the champions of the
German race theory see that there is
a laughing heir behind them in the
Sclavonic supremacy? Once admitting
the race theory, we must confess
that the Panslavist argues well when
he says: "The Roman nations are
dead; the German are on the point
of dying. They once conquered the
world; their present effort is the last
flicker of the expiring light which
points out the road to us. After
them comes our race, with fresh vigor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
on the world's scene. Europe's
future is Panslavism."</p>

<p>The whole theory is radically false.
There are no more primitive races to
take the place of the old ones. The
Germans are as old as the Romans;
or, rather, the Romans were simply
Germans civilized before their brethren.
Russia alone is young in Europe,
but she has nothing new to give us;
and physical force, without a new social
or moral system accompanying
it to establish a conquest, never prevails
long. We cannot, therefore,
judge of Europe's future by this theory
of races.</p>

<p>The power of regeneration must
be sought for elsewhere.</p>


<h3>II.<br />

LIBERALISM.</h3>

<p>One would have thought that the
sanguinary war of 1870 should have
dispelled the illusions of liberalism
for ever. By liberalism, we mean
that party which believes in the principles
of 1789, whose ideal is to have
the middle classes, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeoisie</i>, the
ruling power, to have society equally
divided, to have an atheistical state,
and to obtain eternal peace through unlimited
material progress, which would
identify the interests of nations. Liberalism,
rationalism, and materialism
are different names for the same system.
A state without God, sovereignty
of capital, dissolution of society
into individuals, united by no other
bond than the force of a liberal
parliament majority under the control
of wealth; material prosperity of
the middle classes, founded on gain
and pleasure, with the removal of all
historical traditions, all ecclesiastical
precepts&mdash;such is the dream of this
"shopkeepers' system." Has not
the present war dispelled the dream
of happiness arising from mere material
prosperity? We doubt it.
Notwithstanding the many hard lessons
which the liberal school has
received since the days of Mirabeau
and the Girondins, from the lawyers
of the July dynasty to Ollivier, it
never seems to grow wiser. It is superficial,
never looks into the essence
of things. It is in vain to charge the
present misfortunes of two great nations
on the illiberalism of Napoleon
and Bismarck, and thus exalt
the merits of liberalism; for liberalism
or mere material prosperity was at
the bottom of all their plans. From
1789 to 1870, France, with few exceptions,
was governed by liberalism;
and the revolutions begat the natural
consequences of this system in anarchy
and military despotism. France
during this period has made the
most wonderful material progress.</p>

<p>We read lately in a liberal journal
that the only remedy for the rejuvenation
of states was "the inviolability
of the individual, and respect
for the popular will." Always the
same emptiness of phraseology with
these impracticable dabblers in philosophy.
What will you do if the infallible
"popular will" refuses to recognize
the inviolability of individuals?
Cannot these gentlemen see that
their system merely opens the door
for socialism? They take away religion,
and teach the epicurean theory
of enjoyment; they destroy constitutional
forms of government, and
base authority on the ever-shifting
popular whim. Socialism comes after
them, and says, "You say there
is no God, and I must have pleasure.
I have counted myself, and find that
I am the majority; therefore, I make
a law against capital and property.
You must be satisfied, for you are
my teacher, and I merely follow out
your principles to their logical consequences."</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>


<h3>III.<br />

SOCIALISM.</h3>

<p>A new era is dawning. Not a
mere political period, but a complete
social change, for the actual order
of things is disorder, a compound
of injustice and abuses. We must
have fraternity and equality. Away
with the nobles; away with the
wealthy classes; away with property;
all things must be in common. The
happiness of Europe will never be
realized until socialism reigns supreme.
Such is the socialistic theory.
But does not every one see that its
realization is impossible, and brings
us back to barbarism? The right of
property is essential to society. It is
contrary to nature to expect that
mankind will give up this right to
please a whim of drones&mdash;a system
according to which the lazy and indolent
would have as much right to
property as the industrious and hard-working.
If all is to be common
property, who will work, who will
strive to acquire, whose ambition will
be aroused, whose interest excited
for the attainment of something in
which he will have no right or title?
And in fact, both liberals and socialists
use words which they do not mean;
they are far more despotic when they
get power than those whom they are
continually attacking. At the Berne
Congress of 1868, a socialist orator
said: "We cannot admit that each
man shall choose his own faith; man
has not the right to choose error;
liberty of conscience is our weapon,
but not one of our principles!" By
error he meant Christianity. In fact,
ultra-radicalism is simply ultra-despotism.
Men blamed the despotism
of Napoleon III.; but look at the
despotism of Gambetta, and remember
the despotism of Robespierre
and the "Reign of Terror." Destroy
religion, and you have nothing
left but egotism. Man becomes to
his brother-man either a wolf or a
fox.</p>

<p>Socialism may indeed have its day
in Europe's future. The logic of
liberalism leads to it; but it will be a
fearful day of disorder and revolution;
a sad day for the wealthier
classes; but still only a day. Earthquakes
are possible, and sometimes
they engulf cities; but they pass
away, and quiet returns. New vegetation
springs up on the ruins. If
socialism ever gains Europe, it will
vanish in virtue of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad
absurdum</i>; therefore its mastery can
never be permanent.</p>


<h3>IV.<br />

THE INTERNATIONAL POLICY OF EUROPEAN
STATES SINCE 1789.</h3>

<p>Since neither the race theory, nor
liberalism, nor socialism, can enable
us to solve the problem of Europe's
future, let us pass to other considerations,
glance rapidly over the past,
study the present external and internal
condition of the continent, in
order to be able to form a judgment
on the subject which we are discussing.</p>

<p>The French Revolution of 1789
had its effects all over Europe. In
France since that date, liberalism,
anarchy, and Byzantinism have held
alternate sway. The Bonaparte invasions
carried through the rest of
Europe the liberal principle of
secularization with the <i>Code Napoléon</i>.
The writings of the philosophers
and encyclopædists, and Josephism,
had prepared the way. The reaction
of 1815 was based on Masonic
theories of philanthropism
and religious indifferentism. The
Emperor Alexander and the Holy
Alliance were infected with these
views. The revolutionary movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
in Germany, Italy, and Spain
has since been simply against office-holders
and the police. The influence
of religion has been ignored.
Palmerston was the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coryphæus</i>
of the liberals, and during
his time English diplomacy played
into the hands of all the irreligious
and revolutionary elements in Europe.
This unprincipled system was finally
represented by Napoleon III., in
whose diplomacy the theory of "non-intervention,"
of "nationalities," of
"sovereignty of the people," were
put forward as the types of the perfection
of modern society. In point
of fact, they are mere words used as
a cloak to cover up Macchiavellism.</p>

<p>The "balance of power" theory,
of purely material import, ruled in
1815, but it soon gave way before
the influences of the "liberal" doctrines
of humanitarianism and the
race system. Religious convictions
and Christian institutions were ignored
in politics, and a system of police
substituted in their place. Greece
received its king in consequence of
this system which has prevailed in the
external relations of Europe since
1830. In 1848, the revolutions and
insurrections in Europe were merely
premature appearances of the socialistic
element in liberalism. Napoleon
III., by his Macchiavellian policy,
which Guizot has happily termed
"moderation in evil-doing," coerced
them. He gave all the sanction of
French power to the principles of the
liberal school which he was supposed
to represent. On the principle of
"non-intervention," he prevented the
interference of Austria and Spain in
favor of the Holy See. He protected
the seizure of Naples and
Sicily; approved the invasion of the
Papal States, and substituted, in the
place of dynastic right and popular
right, the colossal delusion of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plébiscite</i>. On the nationality theory,
he allowed Austrian power to be destroyed,
and founded, in opposition
to all French interests, Italian and
German unity.</p>

<p>Although very defective since it
ignored the full claims of religion,
still there was a fixed public law in
Europe from 1815 to 1859. Respect
for the minor powers; the sentiment
of the solidarity of thrones against
the efforts of Carbonarism and the cosmopolitan
revolutionary party; and
regard for treaties, characterize that
period. The traditions of the people
were respected; and treaties repressed
avarice or ambition; and there was
real peace in Europe&mdash;the peace of
order, according to the beautiful expression
of St. Augustine. It is true,
far-seeing minds saw the threatening
cloud on the horizon of the future, and
knew that the system of 1815 did not
rest on the right foundations. Still,
even mere external forms are a protection.</p>

<p>But since 1859 law or treaties no
longer seem to bind. There seems
to be nothing fixed in the public law
of Europe. All is whim; might instead
of right, sentiment instead of
principle. Powers can no longer
unite, for they cannot trust each other.
Instead of all being united to protect
the individual state, now all are hostile
to each other. Italy insists on
unification in spite of law and right,
and to gain her purpose depends to-day
on Prussia; yesterday, it was on
France. She hates Austria, and Austria
acts as if she did not perceive
the hatred, and will not interfere lest
she might offend the liberals. Vienna
is in dread of Berlin and St. Petersburg;
St. Petersburg is in dread of
Berlin. England looks jealously at
Russia, who, meanwhile, is arming in
grim silence, and with occasional
manifestations of her old predilections.
France counts now for nothing.
Prussia, which fifteen years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ago was allowed merely by the favor
of Austria to sit in the congress of
the great powers, is now the only
great military power in Europe. We
say military, for it is not the real, the
hidden power. As in the Greek mythology
grim, inexorable fate ruled
above all the gods, so the head lodge
of the secret societies makes of the
Prussian leaders its blind tools; Italy
obeys it; Napoleon was its slave;
Austria, its sacrifice; and now Prussia
also must bend the knee. Such is
Europe ten years after the Franco-Austrian
war: the Europe of Metternich,
Nesselrode, and Wellington.</p>


<h3>V.<br />

THE INTERNAL POLICY OF THE EUROPEAN
STATES SINCE 1789.</h3>

<p>The revolution has changed the
internal policy of states as well as their
external relations. Forty years ago,
Donoso Cortes remarked that England
was endeavoring to introduce
its constitution into the Continent;
and that the Continent would try to
introduce its different governmental
systems into England. We are now
witnesses of the truth of this observation.
Democratic ideas are gaining
ground in Great Britain; and
bureaucracy, with its centralizing
tendencies, is replacing the English
theory of self-government. Military
conscriptions, along with universal suffrage,
will come next. Owing to the
extension of the franchise, the House
of Commons is losing its aristocratic
character, and the House of Lords
its influence. England will go the
way of France.</p>

<p>We see what the liberal system begotten
of the revolution has caused
in France. An enervated, un-self-reliant,
disunited generation, without
traditions, organization, consistency,
faith, or true patriotism, is its
result. The decrees of the <i>Code
Napoléon</i> concerning inheritances
have broken up families; the departmental
system has destroyed
the provincial peculiarities in which
lies the people's strength; the system
of common lodging-houses for the
laboring classes has destroyed respect
for authority, and afforded ready
material for the purposes of despotism
or secret societies.</p>

<p>In Italy and Spain, we see the same
spectacle. The French, led into Italy
by the first Napoleon, brought thither
the principle of centralization and
a revolutionary code. After Napoleon's
downfall, the restored princes
allowed too much of his system to
remain. This arose from a want of
judgment. The ancient municipalities
were destroyed, even to some extent
in the States of the Church;
Piedmont receiving most of the poison,
and thus becoming the hearth of
the revolution. Constitutionalism,
anarchy, and military governments in
Spain prove the working of revolutionary
doctrines. The old freedom
of that Catholic country, the growth
of centuries, gives way before a nominal
liberty, but a real despotism.</p>

<p>In Germany, too, centralization
carries the day. This country had
the good fortune to be composed of
several independent states, without
any great central power, and the
provincial spirit consequently remained
strong. But now two un-German
words, "unification" and
"uniformity," expressing un-German
tendencies, are carrying the Germans
into despotism. Germany will be
Prussianized, and Prussia Germanized,
say the unificators; but all will,
in the end, be compelled to give way
before the republicans and socialists.
The high schools of Germany are all
infected with the revolutionary doctrines
and Masonic ideas.</p>

<p>What shall we say of Austria?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Thanks to "liberalism," it has disappeared,
and is now a dualism in its
government and tri-parliamentary in
its system.</p>

<p>The licentiousness of the press
helps to destroy everything stable in
governments. Journals without principle,
honor, or religion, filled with
scandals, edited by adventurers,
whose only object is to make money
and serve faithfully their owners,
issue their thousands of copies daily
to corrupt the public mind. Evil
spreads more rapidly than good, and
consequently the influence of the
religious press is weak compared to
that of the revolutionary papers, subsidized
by the agents of secret societies
or by the unprincipled men of
wealth, who readily purchase the aid
of corrupted minds to help on their
ambition.</p>


<h3>VI.<br />

THE POSITION OF THE CHURCH UNDER
THE LIBERAL SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>Governments have therefore ceased
to be Christian, and have become
"liberal," that is, infidel. According
to liberalism, religion is the private
affair of each individual. Civil society
should recognize no dogma, no
worship, no God. We know well
that this principle, from its very intrinsic
absurdity, cannot be practically
carried out. For instance, God will
be recognized when it is necessary to
swear fidelity to a constitution, and
the external forms of religion will be
invoked at the opening of a new
railroad or a session of parliament.
But in principle the liberal state
ignores all positive religious belief.
Its only dogma is that a law passed
by a majority of voters remains a
law until the next majority abrogates
it. This system is called "separation
of church and state," or "a free
church in a free state." Then follow
broken concordats&mdash;in France
and Bavaria, broken by organic
articles; in Baden, Piedmont, Austria,
and Spain, destroyed by the will of
the prince and cabinet ministers.
Then follows a usurped educational
system, in which the rights of the
family and church are disregarded.
In all of these states, more or less,
there is a public persecution of the
church; a repression of her rights;
enthrallment of her ministers; invasion
of her privileges. God is in
heaven, consequently the church
should confine herself to the sanctuary;
that is to say, God does not
trouble himself about the conduct of
nations, politics, legislation, or science.
These are all neutral affairs, over
which his authority does not extend,
and therefore the church has nothing
to do with public life. So say the
liberals. They take from God and
give it to Cæsar, the modern civil
divinity, all that is his, except one
thing which it is impossible for them
to take from him, and that is conscience.
They endeavor to estrange
conscience from God more and more
by education, by the press, and by
public opinion manufactured by the
leaders of the secret societies. Hence
all the talk about "liberty of conscience."
For the same end, they
talk of toleration, but they mean
simply indifference, which hence becomes
the shibboleth of the party
which the church unceasingly opposes.</p>

<p>This is, in a few words, the actual
condition of the church in European
society. It is an unnatural condition.
Even Macchiavelli says: "Princes
and republics which would remain
sound must, before all things, guard
the ceremonies of religion and keep
them ever in honor. Therefore, there
is no surer sign of the decay of a
state than when it sees the worship of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the Most High disregarded." Macchiavelli
spoke from the lessons of
experience and as a mere utilitarian.
Our modern utilitarian politicians
have not his capacity or penetration.
They are mere superficial observers
of fact, and cannot see that the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum
utile</i> is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">summum jus</i>. This
fault lies in ignoring the assistance of
the supernatural order&mdash;in their erroneous
opinion that there is no absolute
truth. The church is not a hospital
for diseased souls; Christianity is not
a mere specific for individual maladies;
but as our Lord has taught us
to pray, "Thy kingdom come ...
on earth as it is in heaven," so must
revealed truth pervade the earth;
percolate through civil society, not
merely in its individual members, but
in all its natural relations, family, municipal,
and state. This is what the
church has taught Europe, and only
by conforming with this teaching can
Europe stand. Since Christianity
came into the world, the Christian
state is the normal condition of political
governments, and not an ideal
impossible of realization. Undoubtedly,
human weakness will always
cause many aberrations from the rule.
But the question is not regarding this
point, but as to the recognition of
the rule. The sin against the Holy
Ghost is the most grievous of all sins.
Our Lord, always so mild and forbearing
toward human passions, is
unflinchingly stern against malicious
resistance to truth, and this has been
precisely the great evil of our time
ever since 1789. In the early ages,
individuals and nations fell into
many errors, but they never touched
the sacred principles of religion. Liberalism
and Freemasonry have caused
the denial of truth itself.</p>

<p>"Must we, then, fall back into the
darkness of the middle ages?" Such
a question, while it shows little knowledge
of the middle ages, exhibits
likewise a spirit of unfairness in discussion.
For our purpose, it suffices
to show the latter. What would we
think of a man who, on being told
that our faith should be childlike,
should say to the priest, "Must I, then,
become a child again?" Plainly, we
would say to him: Good friend, you
talk nonsense; for you know well
that you cannot get again your infant
body, nor blot out the knowledge
and experience acquired in a
life of thirty years. But was not the
sun the same four years ago as it is
now? Do not two and two make
four now as long ago? Did you
not eat and drink when you were a
child as you do now? Some things
are always true in all places and
times; and therefore we do not want
to bring you back into the middle
ages merely because we want to give
the church that position which God
has assigned to her.</p>

<p>"Then you want to saddle a theocracy
on the back of the nineteenth
century?" Let us understand each
other. In a certain sense, a theocracy
must be the aim of every rational
being. God has appointed two orders
to govern men: they are church
and state, neither of which must absorb
the other. Theocracy is not a
government of priests, as those imagine
who have before their eyes the
Hindoo civil systems. Let us for a
moment forget these catchwords,
"middle ages" and "theocracy,"
and go to the marrow of the subject.</p>

<p>The church is the guide of consciences;
not the arbitrary teacher of
men, but the interpreter of revelation
for them. St. Thomas likens the office
of the Vicar of Christ to that of the
flag-ship of a fleet, which the other vessels,
that is, the secular governments
must follow on the open sea in order
to reach the common haven of safety.
Each vessel has its own sails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
moves in its own way, and is managed
by its own mariners. The
church never interferes in the appropriate
sphere of the secular power.
But she warns; she advises; she corrects
all civil authority when it deviates
from the truth and opposes the
revealed order. Her authority over
the state is not direct, but indirect;
she teaches, but she cannot coerce;
she <em>must</em> teach, for political and social
questions necessarily have relations
with dogmatic and moral subjects.
The church must condemn
wrongs, no matter by whom perpetrated,
whether by states or individuals.
This is all the theocratic
power the church claims. A Christian
state will respectfully hear her
warning voice, and thus avoid the
danger; while a pagan state shuts its
ears, despises the church's admonitions,
and plunges into the abyss.</p>

<p>Modern paganism in civil governments
has brought Europe into her
present miserable condition. Can
she get out of it, or is European society
hopelessly lost?</p>


<h3>VII.<br />

EUROPE'S FUTURE.</h3>

<p>The Franco-Prussian war of 1870
is one of the most important events
in the history of Europe. The prostration
of France is no indication
that she will never rise again, for in
1807 Prussia was in a worse condition
than France is now. In 1815,
and until the past few years, Prussia
was last in the list of the great powers,
though now she is the first.
France, then, in a few years may rise
again to her full power. There are
no more fresh, uncivilized races to
come into Europe to take the place
of those which are now said to be
decaying. We have shown that liberalism
has reached its acme, been
found wanting, and is dying. Its efforts
in Italy, Spain, Germany, Vienna,
and Pesth are but the last convulsions
of an expiring system. The
natural child of liberalism&mdash;socialism&mdash;must
also disappear before the common
sense of mankind. What remains?
Will there be in Europe the
alternate anarchy and despotism of
the Central American republics without
any end? Must we despair of
Europe's future? No, a thousand
times no! We look to the future
with hope and consolation.</p>

<p>Common sense and religion will
win the day; Christianity has still
the regenerating power which she
showed in civilizing the barbarians.
Christianity has been the principle
of national life since the Redeemer
established it as a world religion.
The spiritual life must be renovated
by truth and morality. Christianity is
both. We Christians hope, therefore,
for the conversion of the popular
mind; we begin even now to perceive
signs of regeneration, renovation,
renewed energy, and vigor in
mental convictions and civic virtues.</p>

<p>God's punishments are proofs of
his mercy. He chastises to convert.
The first punishment of France, in
1789, was not enough to teach her
to repent. Louis XVIII. came to
the throne a free-thinker instead of
a Christian. The prostrate armies
of Metz and Sedan are the result of
corrupting and enervating infidelity.
God chastises ambition and pride in
nations as well as in individuals. The
Republic has shown itself incapable,
because it possessed neither honor,
principle, nor religion. The victories
of Prussia are a blessing of God for
France. The Prussian army is but
the instrument which God has used
to punish a culprit nation&mdash;a revolutionary,
irreligious, and frivolous system
of government. Victorious Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
too, will be taught to reflect
when it sees the blood of its thousands
of slaughtered sons, and the
miseries which the war has entailed
on its once happy families. Wars
teach unruly nations to reflect. Will
the present war suffice to humble
Europe, and cause her to reflect?
We know not; but God will send
other chastisements if this one avails
nothing. Dark clouds are already
rising in the East, which may soon
burst over Austria and Germany.
The rod of God's anger will be felt
by Austria again, for her lessons of
1859 and 1866 have been forgotten.
They have only made her throw herself
more fondly into the arms of the
devil. In Italy, the secret societies
will yet avenge on the house of
Savoy the blood of the defenders of
the Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>But the German empire has been
re-established under a Prussian emperor.
Yes, but this is only an episode
in the actual crisis of the world.
A Protestant emperor of Germany is
entirely different from a German emperor.
The old German emperors
represented the idea of the Christian
monarchy; the Protestant emperor
in Berlin represents modern Cæsarism.
His empire cannot last long,
for history tells us that empires of
sudden and accidental growth lose
rapidly the power which they as
rapidly acquired. But is not Prussia's
triumph the triumph of Protestantism
in Europe? Such a question
is easily answered: Protestantism
as a positive religion no longer
exists in Prussia or elsewhere; and
Protestantism as a negation exists
everywhere, perhaps more in some
Catholic lands than in Prussia. On
the battle-fields of Wörth and Gravelotte,
the Catholic Church was not
represented by France, and Lutheranism
by Prussia. Catholic Bavarians,
Westphalians, and Rhinelanders
fought for Prussia, and would be
astounded to hear that they were fighting
for heresy. Priests and Sisters of
Charity accompanied them to battle.
Who, on the other hand, would call
the Turcos Catholics? Or the French
officers, who never heard Mass, and
who curtailed the number of Catholic
chaplains to the minimum? Were
the French soldiers, who drilled on
Sundays instead of going to church,
on whose barracks, in some cases,
was written, "No admission for policemen,
dogs, or priests"&mdash;were
they the Catholic champions? No;
the Christian soldier in France first
appeared, in this war, with Charette
and Cathelineau in the Loire army,
demoralized and destroyed, however,
by the mad-cap radical, Gambetta,
and his infidel associates. In fact,
the Prussian army was more Catholic
than the French. The latter must
be won back to religion from the
enervating influences of Freemasonry
and Voltairianism before it can regain
its prestige. The only hope for
France is in her zealous clergy, in
the vigor of the old Catholic provinces,
and in her humiliations, which
ought to bring repentance.</p>

<p>The rustling of Catholic renovation
is heard all over Europe. The
rising generation will bring Italy
back to the church. The spirit of
the Tyrol and of Westphalia is
spreading through Germany. The
Ultramontanes in Saxony, Bohemia,
Steyermark, show the energy of this
renovation. The peasantry of Austria
and of a large portion of Germany
are still uncorrupted. Hungary
is steadfast in the faith. The
seizure of Rome by the Sardinian
robbers has roused the Catholic heart
of the world and helped on the cause
of regeneration. Where the Catholic
faith was supposed to be crushed,
lo! it has raised its head defiantly.</p>

<p>The deceived nations want peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
freedom, order, and authority. These
blessings infidelity and liberalism
have taken away. The people are
beginning to see that the old yet
ever young Apostolic Church alone
can guarantee them. They will turn
to Rome, where lives the Vicar of
Him who said, "I am the way, the
truth, and the life;" to Rome freed
again from the barbarians; to Rome
become Roman again when it has
ceased to be Sardinian; to Rome
will the people look for peace and
order. It is Rome that tells men
that Christ is Lord of the world;
that he conquers; that he governs.
The social dominion of Christ will
again be established. We shall see
again Christian states founded on
Christian principles and traditions,
with Christian laws and rulers.
Whether these rulers will be kings or
presidents we know not; but they
will in either case consider themselves
as mere delegates of Jesus Christ, and
of his people, not as Byzantine despots
or representatives of mob tyranny.
They will understand that
statesmanship does not consist in
giving license to the wicked<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and
forging chains for the good. We
shall have Christian schools, Christian
universities, Christian statesmen. Ye
liberals in name, well may ye
grow pale! The future of the world
belongs to the principles of the Syllabus,
and this future is not far off.
We conclude with the words of Count
de Maistre: "In the year 1789, the
rights of man were proclaimed; in
the year 1889, man will proclaim the
rights of God!"</p>

<h2>BISHOP TIMON.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h2>


<p>We hope the day may come before
many years when historians will see
in the records of the struggles, misfortunes,
and triumphs of the church
a theme for the employment of brilliant
pens as tempting as they now
find in the clash of armies and the
intrigues of statesmen. Scholars have
devoted to our records the patient
investigation of years; the general
history of the church has been summarized
for popular reading in most
of the principal modern languages;
and for the use of theologians and
students there are elaborate and costly
collections. Individual biographies
of saints and preachers innumerable
have been written for the edification
of the devout. Sketches of local
church history, more or less complete,
have occasionally appeared&mdash;sketches,
for instance, like <i>The Catholic
Church in the United States</i>, by De
Courcy and Shea; Shea's <cite>History of
the Catholic Missions</cite> among the Indian
tribes of America, and Bishop
Bayley's little volume on the history
of the church in New York. But a
work of a different kind, broader in
its design than some of these excellent
and useful publications, more
limited in scope than the dry and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>costly general histories, still awaits
the hand of a polished and enthusiastic
man of letters. Why should
not the same eloquence and learning
be devoted to the religious history of
the great countries of the globe that
Macaulay, and Motley, and Froude
have expended upon the political revolutions
of states and the intricate
dramas of diplomacy? Why should
not some glowing pen do for the
pioneers of the cross what Prescott
did for the pioneers of Spanish conquest
in the new hemisphere? Properly
told, the church history of almost
any country of the world, of almost
any period in Christian times,
would be a narrative not only of religious
significance, but of thrilling
interest. No men ever passed through
more extraordinary adventures, considered
even from a human point of
view, than the missionaries who penetrated
into unknown lands or first
went among unbelieving nations.
No contest between hostile kingdoms
or rival dynasties ever offered a more
tempting theme for dramatic narrative
and glowing description than the
contest which has raged for eighteen
centuries and a half, between the powers
of light and the powers of darkness,
in all the different quarters of the
civilized world. Think what a brilliant
writer might make of such a
subject as the church history of Germany!
Think what has yet to be
done for the churches of England and
Ireland and France, when the coming
historian rescues their chronicles
from the dusty archives of state and
the gloom of monastic libraries, and
causes the old stories to glow with a
new light, such as Gibbon threw
upon the records of the declining
empire!</p>

<p>We doubt not the literary alchemist
<em>will</em> come in time, and melt
down the dull metals in his crucible,
and pour out from it the shining compound
which shall possess a popular
value a hundredfold beyond that of
the untransmuted materials. Nowhere,
perhaps, will the labor be
more amply repaid than in America.
Nowhere will the collection of materials
be less arduous and the result
more brilliant. Our church history
begins just when that of Europe is
most perplexing, and to an investigator
with time, patience, and a moderate
revenue at his command, it offers
no appalling difficulties. In a great
part of America, the introduction of
the Catholic religion is an event within
the memory of men still living.
The pioneers of many of the states
are still at work. The first missionaries
of some of the most important
sees are but just passing to their reward.
There are no monumental slanders
upon our history to be removed; no
Protestant writers have seriously encumbered
the field with misrepresentations.
Industrious students of our own
faith have already prepared the way;
scattered chapters have been written
with more or less literary skill; the
store-houses of information have been
discovered and partly explored; and
every year the facilities for the historian
are multiplied. And certainly the
theme is rich in romantic interest and
variety. From the time of the monks
and friars who came over with the
first discoverers of the country down
to the present year of our Lord, when
missionaries are perilling their lives
among the Indians of the great West,
and priests are fighting for the faith
against the cultivated Protestants of
the Atlantic cities, the Catholic history
of the United States has been a
series of bold adventures, startling
incidents, and contests of the most
dramatic character. In the whole
story there is not a really dull chapter.
The Catholic annals of America
abound also with that variety
which the historian needs to render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his pages really attractive; and
among the great men who would
naturally be the central figures of
such a work, there is the widest difference
of character, the most picturesque
divergence of pursuits and personal
peculiarities. Group together
the most distinguished of the Christian
heroes who have illustrated our
chronicles, and you have what an artist
might call a wonderfully rich variety
of coloring. There are the simple-minded,
enthusiastic Spanish Franciscans,
following the armies of Cortez
and Pizarro, and exploring the
strange realms of the Aztecs and the
Incas. There is the French Jesuit,
building up his Christian empire
among the Indians of the St. Lawrence
and the Great Lakes. There
is the gentle Marquette, floating in his
bark canoe down the mighty river
with whose discovery his name will
ever be associated, and breathing his
last in the midst of the primeval wilderness.
There are Jogues and Brebœuf,
suffering unheard-of torments
among the Iroquois; Cheverus, the
polished and fascinating cardinal,
winning the affection of the New
England Puritans; England, conciliating
the Huguenots and Anglicans
of the South. The saintly Bruté,
most amiable of scholars, most devout
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i>, is a quaint but beautiful
character around whom cluster
some of our most touching associations.
Bishop Dubois, the "Little
Bonaparte" of the Mountain; Gallitzin,
the Russian prince who hid the
lustre of his rank among the log-cabins
of the Alleghanies; Hughes, the
great fighting archbishop, swinging
his battle-axe over the heads of the
parsons; De Smet, the mild-mannered
but indomitable missionary of
the Rocky Mountains&mdash;these are specimens
of our leaders whose place in
history has yet to be described by the
true literary artist. Several have been
made the subject of special biographies,
but none have yet appeared in
their true light as the central figures
of an American church history.</p>

<p>The book which suggests these
remarks is a contribution of materials
for the future historian, and as such
we give it a cordial welcome. Mr.
Deuther, it is true, is not a practised
writer, and is not entirely at his ease
in the use of our language. But he
has shown great industry in the collection
of facts, and has rescued from
oblivion many interesting particulars
of the early career of Bishop Timon
in a part of the United States whose
missionary history is very imperfectly
known. Thus he has rendered an
important service to Catholic literature,
and earned full forgiveness for
the literary offences which impair the
value of his book as a biography.
The episcopacy of the estimable man
whose life is here told was not an
especially eventful one, and except in
one instance attracted comparatively
little public notice. The most conspicuous
men, however, are not always
the most useful. Bishop Timon
had a great work to perform in
the organization and settlement of
his new diocese, and he did it none
the less efficiently because he labored
quietly. The best known incident
of his official life&mdash;the lamentable
contest with the trustees of the
Church of St. Louis in Buffalo&mdash;is not
one which Catholics can take any
satisfaction in recalling; but it had a
serious bearing upon the future of
the American Church, and its lessons
even now may be reviewed with
profit. Bishop Kenrick in Philadelphia,
Bishop Hughes in New York,
and Bishop Timon in Buffalo have
between them the honor, if not of
destroying a system which had done
the church incalculable injury, at
least of extracting its evil principle.
Mr. Deuther gives the history of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
warfare at considerable length, and
with an affluence of documents which,
though not very entertaining to read,
will be found convenient some time
or another for reference. We presume
that most people will be interested
rather in the earlier chapters
of the biography, and to these we
shall consequently give our principal
attention.</p>

<p>John Timon was of American birth
but Irish parentage. His father,
James, emigrated from the county
Cavan in the latter part of 1796 or
the beginning of 1797, and settled
at Conewago,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in Adams County,
Pennsylvania, where, in a rude log-house,
the subject of this biography
was born on the 12th of February,
1797, the second of a family of ten
children. The father and mother
seem to have been remarkably devout
people, and from an anecdote
related by Mr. Deuther we can fancy
that the lavish beneficence which
characterized the bishop was an hereditary
virtue in the family. Mr.
James Timon called, one day, upon a
priest whom he had known in Ireland,
and, taking it for granted that
the reverend gentleman must be in
want of money, he slipped into his
hand at parting a $100 bill, and hurried
away. The priest, supposing
Mr. Timon had made a mistake, ran
after him, and overtook him in the
street. "My dear friend," said the generous
Irishman, "it was no mistake.
I intended it for you." "But," said
the clergyman, "I assure you I am
not in want; I do not need it."
"Never mind; there are many who
do. If you have no use for the money
yourself, give it to the poor."
The Timon family removed to Baltimore
in 1802, and there John received
his school education, such as
it was. As soon as he was old
enough, he became a clerk in a dry-goods
shop kept by his father; and
Mr. Deuther prints a very foolish
story to the effect that he was so
much liked by everybody that by the
time he was nineteen "he had become
a toast for all aged mothers
with marriageable daughters," and
had refused "many eligible and grand
offers of marriage," which we take
the liberty of doubting. From Baltimore
the family removed, in 1818,
to Louisville, and thence in the following
spring to St. Louis. Here prosperity
at last rewarded Mr. Timon's
industry, and he accumulated a considerable
fortune, only to lose it, however,
in the commercial crisis of 1823.
In the midst of these pecuniary misfortunes,
John Timon suffered a still
heavier loss in the death of a young
lady to whom he was engaged to be
married. Mr. Deuther's apology for
mentioning this incident&mdash;which he
strangely characterizes as an "undeveloped
frivolity" in the life of a bishop
of the church&mdash;is entirely superfluous;
he would have been a
faithless biographer if he had not
mentioned it. We may look upon it
as a manifestation of the kindness of
divine Providence, which called the
young man to a higher and more
useful life, and designed first to break
off his attachment to all the things
of this world. He heard and obeyed
the call, and, in the month of
April, 1823, became a student of the
Lazarists at their preparatory seminary
of St. Mary's of the Barrens, in
Perry County, Missouri, about eighty
miles below St. Louis.</p>

<p>The Lazarists, or Priests of the Mission,
had been introduced into the
United States only six years before, and
their institutions, founded, with great
difficulty, in the midst of a poor and
scattered population, were still struggling
with debt and discouragement.
The little establishment at the Barrens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was for many years in a pitiable condition
of destitution. When Mr. Timon
entered as a candidate not only
for the priesthood, but for admission
to the congregation, it was governed
by the Rev. Joseph Rosati, who became,
a year later, the first Bishop of
St. Louis. The buildings consisted
of a few log-houses. The largest of
them, a one-story cabin, contained in
one corner the theological department,
in another the schools of philosophy
and general literature, in a
third the tailor's shop, and in the
fourth the shoemaker's. The refectory
was a detached log-house; and,
in very bad weather, the seminarians
often went to bed supperless rather
than make the journey thither in
search of their very scanty fare. It
was no uncommon thing for them,
of a winter's morning, to rise from
their mattresses, spread upon the
floor, and find over their blankets a
covering of snow which had drifted
through the crevices of the logs.
The system upon which the seminary
was supported was the same
that prevails at Mount St. Mary's.
For three hours in the day the students
of divinity were expected to
teach in the secular college connected
with the seminary, and for out-of-door
exercise they cut fuel and worked
on the farm. Mr. Timon, in spite
of these labors, made such rapid progress
in his studies that, in 1824, he
was ordained sub-deacon, and began
to accompany his superiors occasionally
in their missionary excursions.</p>

<p>They lived in the midst of spiritual
destitution. The French pioneers of
the Western country had planted the
faith at St. Louis and some other prominent
points, but they had left few
or no traces in the vast tracts of territory
surrounding the earlier settlements,
and to most of the country
people the Roman Catholic Church
was no better than a sort of aggravated
pagan imposture. Protestant
preachers used to show themselves at
the very doors of the churches and
challenge the priests to come out and
be confuted. Wherever the Lazarists
travelled, they were looked at with
the most intense curiosity. Very few
of the settlers had ever seen a priest
before. The Catholics, scattered here
and there, had generally been deprived,
for years, of Mass and the
sacraments, and their children were
growing up utterly ignorant of religion.
Mr. Timon was accustomed
to make a regular missionary circuit
of fifteen or twenty miles around the
Barrens in company with Father
Odin, afterward Archbishop of New
Orleans. The duty of the sub-deacon
was to preach, catechise, and instruct.
Sometimes they had no other shelter
than the woods, and no other food
than wild berries. At a settlement
called Apple Creek, they made a
chapel out of a large pig-pen, cleaning
it out with their own hands,
building an altar, and so decorating
the poor little place with fresh boughs
that it became the wonder of the
neighborhood. In 1824, Messrs.
Odin and Timon made a long missionary
tour on horseback. Mr. Deuther
says they went to "New Madrid,
<i>Texas</i>," and thence as far as
"the Port of Arkansas." New Madrid,
of course, is in Missouri, and
the Port of Arkansas undoubtedly
means Arkansas Post, in the State
of Arkansas, which could not very
well be reached by the way of Texas.
Along the route they travelled&mdash;where
they had to swim rivers, flounder
through morasses, and sleep in
the swamps&mdash;no priest had been seen
for more than thirty-five years. Their
zeal, intelligence, graceful and impassioned
speech, and modest manners,
seem to have made a great impression
on the settlers. They had the
satisfaction of disarming much prejudice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
receiving some converts, and
administering the sacraments; and,
after an interesting visit to an Indian
tribe on the Arkansas River, they returned
to the Barrens. About this
time (in 1825), Mr. Timon was promoted
to the priesthood and appointed
a professor at the seminary. His
missionary labors were now greatly
increased. Mr. Deuther tells some
interesting anecdotes of his tours,
which curiously illustrate the state
of religion at that time in the West.
One day, Father Timon was summoned
to Jackson, Missouri, to visit
a murderer under sentence of death.
With some difficulty he got admission
to the jail, but a crowd of men, led
by a Baptist minister named Green,
who was also editor of the village
newspaper, entered with him. The
prisoner was found lying on a heap
of straw and chained to a post. The
hostile mob refused to leave the priest
alone with him; but, in spite of their
interference, Father Timon succeeded
in touching the man's heart and preparing
him for the sacraments. While
they were repeating the Apostles'
Creed together, the minister pushed
forward and exclaimed, "Do not
make the poor man lose his soul
by teaching him the commandments
of men!" and this interruption was
followed by a violent invective against
Romish corruptions.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green," said the priest, "not
long ago, I refuted all these charges
before a public meeting in the court-house
of this village, and challenged
anybody who could answer me to
stand forth and do so. You were
present, but you made no answer.
Surely this is no time for you to interfere&mdash;when
I am preparing a man
for death!"</p>

<p>Mr. Green's only reply was a challenge
to a public controversy next
day, which Father Timon immediately
accepted. The minister then
insisted upon making a rancorous
polemical prayer, in the course of
which he said: "O God of mercy!
save this man from the fangs of Antichrist,
who now seeks to teach him
idolatry and the vain traditions of
men."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," exclaimed the
priest to the crowd which now filled
the dungeon, "is it right that, in a
prayer to the God of charity and truth,
this man should introduce a calumny
against the majority of Christians?"</p>

<p>How far the extraordinary discussion
might have gone it would be hard
to guess, had not the sheriff turned
everybody out and locked the jail for
the night. The next morning, the
debate took place according to agreement,
the district judge being appointed
moderator. After about three
or four hours' speaking, Mr. Green
gave up the battle and withdrew.
Father Timon kept on for an hour
and a half longer, and the result is
said to have been a great Catholic
revival in the community. The prisoner,
who had steadily refused to
accept the ministrations of any but a
Catholic clergyman, was baptized immediately
after the debate.</p>

<p>On another occasion, Father Timon
carried on a debate with a Protestant
clergyman&mdash;apparently a Methodist&mdash;in
the court-house at Perryville.
The Methodist was easily worsted,
but there was soon to be a conference
meeting some eighteen miles
off, and there he felt sure the priest
would meet his match.</p>

<p>"Do you mean this as a challenge?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't invite you. I only
say you can go if you choose."</p>

<p>Father Timon refused to go under
these circumstances; but, learning afterward
that a rumor was in circulation
that he had pledged himself to
be on the ground, he changed his
mind, and reached the scene of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
meeting&mdash;which was in the open air&mdash;just
after one of the preachers had finished
a discourse on Transubstantiation
and the Real Presence. "There
is a Romish priest present," this orator
had said, "and, if he dares to come
forward, the error of his ways will be
pointed out to him." So Father Timon
mounted a stump, and announced
that in a quarter of an hour he
would begin a discourse on the Real
Presence. This was more than the
ministers had bargained for. They
had been confident he would not attend.
They surrounded him, in considerable
excitement, and declared
that he should not preach. Father
Timon appealed to the people, and
they decided that he should be heard.
He borrowed a Bible from one of
his adversaries, and with the aid of
numerous texts explained and supported
the Catholic doctrine. The discussion
was long and earnest. The
preachers at last were silenced, and
Father Timon continued for some time
to exhort the crowd and urge them
to return to the true church. Which
was, to say the least, a curious termination
for a Methodist conference
meeting.</p>

<p>One of the most serious difficulties
which the pioneer missionaries had
to encounter was the want of opportunities
of private converse with people
whose hearts had been stirred by
the first motions of divine grace.
The log-dwellings of the settlers rarely
contained more than one room,
and that often held a pretty large
family. Many anecdotes are told
of confessions made among the cornstalks
in the garden, or under the
shadow of the forest, or on horseback
in the lonely roads. On one occasion
Father Timon had been summoned
a long distance to visit a dying
man. The cabin consisted of a
single room. When all was over, the
wife of the dead man knelt beside
the body and made her confession,
the rest of the family and the neighbors,
meanwhile, standing out-doors
in the rain. Then the widow was
baptized into the church, and, as the
storm was violent and the hour past
midnight, Father Timon slept on the
bed with the corpse, while the rest
of the company disposed themselves
on the floor.</p>

<p>Ten years had been passed in labors
of this kind, when, in 1835, letters
arrived from Paris, erecting the
American mission of the Lazarists
into a province, and appointing Father
Timon visitor. He accepted
the charge with great reluctance and
only after long hesitation. It was
indeed a heavy burden. The affairs
of the congregation were far from
prosperous. The institution at the
Barrens was deeply in debt. The
revenues were uncertain. The relations
between the seminary and the
bishop were not entirely harmonious.
Several priests had left the community,
and were serving parishes without
the permission of their superiors. To
restore discipline would be an invidious
task on many accounts. But,
having undertaken the office, Father
Timon did not shrink. He saved
the college and seminary from threatened
extinction; he brought back
his truant brethren; he revived the
spirit of zeal and self-sacrifice; he
restored harmony; he greatly improved
the finances. In a short time, he
made a visit to France, and returned
with a small supply of money and a
company of priests. On Christmas
Eve, in 1838, he sailed for Galveston,
in order to make a report to the
Holy See upon the condition of religion
in the republic of Texas. He
found the country in a sad state of
spiritual destitution. The only priests
were two Mexicans at San Antonio,
who lived in open concubinage.
There were no churches. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
no sacraments. Even marriage was
a rite about which the settlers were
not over-particular. Father Timon
did what little he could, on a hurried
tour, to remedy these evils; but a
year or two later he came back as
prefect apostolic, accompanied by
M. Odin, and now he was able to
introduce great reforms. Congregations
were collected, churches begun
in all the largest settlements, and the
scandals at San Antonio abated. Firm
in correction, but gracious in manner,
untiring in labors, insensible to fear,
making long journeys with a single
companion through dangerous Indian
countries, struggling through
swamps, swimming broad rivers&mdash;the
prefect and his assistant, M. Odin,
travelled, foot-sore, hungry, and in
rags, through this rude wilderness,
and wherever they passed they planted
the good seed and made ready
the soil for the husbandmen who
were to come after them. In the
principal towns and settlements they
were invariably received with honor.
The court-houses or other public
rooms were placed at their disposal
for religious services, and the educated
Protestant inhabitants took pains
to meet them socially and learn from
them something about the faith. We
find in the account of these tours
no trace of the acrimonious polemical
discussions which used to enliven
the labors of the missionaries at the
Barrens. There was little or no controversy,
and the priests were invited
to explain religious truth rather over
the dinner-table than on the rostrum.
At the request of Mr. Timon, M. Odin
was soon afterward appointed vicar
apostolic of Texas, and sent to continue
the work thus happily begun.</p>

<p>It was in 1847 that Mr. Timon
was removed from the Western field
and consecrated first Bishop of Buffalo.
When he had disposed all his
affairs and made ready for his departure,
his worldly goods consisted of
a small trunk about half-full of scanty
clothing. He had to borrow money
enough to pay his way to New
York. But meanwhile some friends,
having heard of his poverty, replenished
his wardrobe, and made up a
purse of $400 for his immediate
needs. He was consecrated in the
cathedral of New York by Bishops
Hughes, Walsh, and McCloskey, on
the 17th of October, and reached
Buffalo five days afterward. It was
evening when he arrived. An immense
crowd of people&mdash;it is said as
many as 10,000&mdash;were in waiting for
him at the railway station. There
were bands of music, banners, and
flambeaux, a four-horse carriage for
the bishop, and a long torchlight
procession to escort him home. It
is reported&mdash;but the biographer gives
the story with some reserve&mdash;that, after
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i> had gone some distance,
the humble bishop was discovered,
valise in hand, trudging afoot
through the rain and mud, behind
the coach in which he was supposed
to be riding. In after-times he must
have sadly compared the cordial
greeting of his flock on this night
with the trials, the insults, the persecutions,
which he had to bear from
some of the very same people during
almost the whole of his episcopate.
We shall not enlarge upon the history
of these sad years. The scandals
which arose from the factious and
schismatical spirit of the trustees of
the Church of St. Louis in Buffalo
are too recent to have been forgotten
by our readers. The troubles began
while Bishop Timon was still a humble
missionary in Missouri. They
had been quelled by the firmness of
Bishop Hughes, but they broke out
again very soon after the creation of
the new diocese, and Bishop Timon
suffered from them to the end of his
life. Having no cathedral and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
house, he lodged when he first arrived
with the pastor of St. Louis's, but
he had been there only a few weeks
when the trustees, in their mad jealousy
of possible invasion of their
imaginary rights, requested him to
find a home somewhere else. This
brutal behavior was the beginning
of a long warfare. Those who may
care about studying it will find the
necessary documents in Mr. Deuther's
book. Let us rather devote the
short space remaining at our disposal
to a description of some of the
charming traits of character of the
holy man who crowned a life of incessant
labor with an old age of suffering.
From the moment of his elevation
to the episcopal dignity, the
sacred simplicity of his disposition
seems to have daily increased. If
the anecdote of his behavior at the
torchlight reception is not true, it is
at any rate consistent with his character.
Bishop Hughes declared
that the Bishop of Buffalo was the
humblest man he had ever known.
Though he was very neat and precise
in everything relating to the service
of the sanctuary, rags of any
kind seemed to him "good enough
for the old bishop," and it was only
by stealth, so to speak, that his
friends could keep his wardrobe tolerably
well supplied. In his visits to
the seminary it was his delight to
talk familiarly with the young men.
At the orphan asylum the children
used to ride on his back. Visiting
strange churches, he would kneel in
the confessional like any other penitent.
In his private and official intercourse
with his clergy, it was not
unusual for him to beg pardon with
the utmost humility for fancied acts
of injustice. On one occasion he
had slightly rebuked a priest for some
irregularity. Satisfied afterward that
the rebuke had not been deserved,
he invited the priest to dinner, placed
him at the head of the table,
treated him with marked distinction,
and afterward, taking him to his
own room, in the presence of another
bishop, threw himself upon his
knees and begged to be forgiven.
In the course of a visitation to a disturbed
parish, a member of the congregation
he was addressing publicly
spat in the bishop's face. He
took no notice of the occurrence, but
went on with his remarks. "Never
shall I forget," wrote the late distinguished
Jesuit, Father Smarius, "the
days of the missions for the laity and
of the retreats for the clergy which
I had the pleasure to conduct in the
cathedral of Buffalo during the three
or four years previous to his holy demise.
The first to rise in the morning
and to ring the bell for meditation
and for prayer, he would totter
from door to door along the corridors
of the episcopal residence, with a
lighted candle in his hand, to see
whether all had responded to the call
of the bell and betaken themselves
to the spot marked out for the performance
of that sacred and wholesome
duty.... And then, that
more than fatherly heart, that forgiving
kindness to repentant sinners,
even such as had again and again
deservedly incurred his displeasure
and the penalties of ecclesiastical
censures or excommunications. 'Father,'
he would say, 'I leave this case
in your hands. I give you all power,
only save his soul.' And then, that
simple, child-like humility, which
seemed wounded by even the performance
of acts which the excellence
and dignity of the episcopacy naturally
force from its subjects and inferiors.
How often have I seen him
fall on his aged knees, face to face
with one or other of my clerical
brethren, who had fallen on theirs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
receive his saintly blessing!" He
took great pains to cultivate the virtue
of humility in his clergy. A
proud priest he had little hope for.
To those who complained of the
hardships of the mission, he would
answer, "Why did you become a
priest? It was to suffer, to be persecuted,
according to the example
laid down by our Lord Jesus Christ."
In the strictness with which he tried
to watch over the spiritual welfare of
his clergy, and changed their positions
when he thought the good of
their souls required it, his rule was
like that of the superior of a monastery
rather than the head of a diocese.
He was filled to a remarkable
decree with the spirit of prayer. He
began no labor, decided no question,
without long and fervent supplication
for the divine assistance. On occasions
of festivity or ceremony, he loved
to steal away to the quiet of the
sanctuary, and under the shadow of
a column in the cathedral to pass
long hours in meditation. In travelling
he was often seen kneeling in
his seat in the cars. His household
was always ordered like a religious
community. The day began and
ended with prayer and meditation in
common. The bishop rose at five,
and in the evening retired early to
his room&mdash;not to sleep, but to pass
most of the night in devotion, study,
and writing. Up to the very close
of his life he used to set out in the
depth of winter to visit distant parishes
unannounced, starting from the
house before any one else was awake,
and trudging painfully through the
snow with his bag in his hand. Religious
communities, when they assembled
for morning devotions, were often surprised
to find the bishop on his
knees waiting for them. By these
sudden visits he was sometimes enabled
to correct irregularities, which
he never suffered to pass unrebuked;
but he used to say that in dealing
with others he would rather be too
lax than too severe, as he hoped to be
judged mercifully by Almighty God.</p>

<p>Mr. Deuther, in attempting to show
that the bishop had to conquer a naturally
quick temper, has created an impression,
we fear, that this saintly man
was irascible if not violent in his disposition.
It is most earnestly to be
hoped that no one will conceive such
an utterly wrong idea. Mr. Deuther
himself corrects his own unguarded
language, and it is only necessary to
read the book carefully to see that
he does not mean what at first glance
he seems not to say, but to imply.
Nobody who knew Bishop Timon
will hesitate to call him one of the
kindest and most amiable of men;
whatever faults he may have had,
nobody will think of mentioning a
hot temper as one of them. The
sweetness of his disposition was in
correspondence with the tenderness
of his heart. The patience with
which he bore the sorrows of his episcopate
was equalled by the keenness
with which he felt them. Toward
the close of his life several anonymous
communications, accusing him
of cruelty, avarice, injustice, and
many other faults&mdash;of cruelty, this
man whose heart was as soft as a
woman's&mdash;of avarice, this charitable
soul, who gave away everything he
had, and left himself at times not
even a change of linen&mdash;of injustice,
this bishop who pardoned every one
but himself&mdash;were sent him in the
form of printed circulars. So deeply
was he wounded that his biographer
is assured that the incident hastened
his death; he never was the same
man afterward. At the end of the
next diocesan synod he knelt before
his priests, and, in a voice broken by
tears, asked pardon of every one present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
whom he might have in any
manner treated unjustly. He died on
the 16th of April, 1867, after a rapid
but gradual decay whose termination
he himself was the first to foresee,
and his last hours were as beautiful
and inspiring as his years of holy
labor.</p>

<h2>OUR LADY OF LOURDES.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF HENRI LASSERRE.</p>


<h3>PART SIXTH.<br />

I.</h3>

<p>The enemies of "superstition"
had lost a good deal of ground in
their desperate struggle against the
events which for the last ten or twelve
weeks had scandalized their distressed
philosophy. As it had become
impossible to deny the existence of
the fountain whose pure streams were
flowing before the eyes of the amazed
people, so it was becoming impossible
to continue denying the reality
of the cures which were being worked,
continually and in many places,
by the use of this mysterious water.</p>

<p>At first the incredulous had shrugged
their shoulders at the report of
these cures, taking the simple course
of denying them out-and-out, and
refusing to make any examination.
Then some skilful persons had invented
several false miracles, to enjoy
an easy triumph in refuting them.
But they had very soon been confounded
by the multiplicity of these
wonderful cures, of which a few have
been mentioned. The facts were
evident. They became so numerous
and so striking that it was necessary,
however painful it might be, either
to acknowledge their miraculous nature
or find some natural explanation
for them.</p>

<p>The free-thinkers, then, understood
that, unless they were willing either
to surrender or to deny in the face
of complete evidence, it was absolutely
necessary to take up some
new line of tactics.</p>

<p>The most intelligent of the clique,
indeed, saw that things had already
gone too far, and perceived the grave
error which they had committed at
the outset in denying prematurely
and without examination facts which
had afterward become patent and
perfectly well established, such as
the appearance of the fountain, and
the cures of a great number of many
who were notoriously incurable by
natural means, and who were now
to be seen going about the streets of
the town in perfect health. What
made the mistake worse and almost
irreparable was that these unfortunate
denials of the most well-attested
events were authentically and officially
recorded in all the newspapers
of the department.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The greater part of the cures effected
by the Massabielle water had
a character of rapidity, nay, even of
instantaneousness, which clearly showed
the immediate action of sovereign
power. There were some, however,
which did not present this evidently
supernatural appearance, being accomplished
after baths or draughts
repeated a few or many times, and
in a slow and gradual manner&mdash;resembling
somewhat in their mode the
ordinary course of natural cures,
though in reality different.</p>

<p>In a village called Gez, near
Lourdes, a little child of seven years
had been the subject of one of these
cures, of a mixed character, which, according
to one's natural inclination,
might be attributed to a special grace
of God or to the unaided forces of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
nature. This child, named Lasbareilles,
had been born entirely deformed,
with a double curvature of
the back and breast-bone. His thin
and almost withered legs were useless
from their extreme weakness;
the poor little boy had never been
able to walk, but was always either
sitting or lying down. When he
had to move, his mother carried him
in her arms. Sometimes, indeed, the
child, resting on the edge of the table
or helped by his mother's hand,
could manage to keep himself up and
to take a few steps; but it was at
the cost of violent efforts and immense
fatigue. The physician of the
place had professed himself unable
to cure him; and the disease being
organic, no remedy had ever been
resorted to.</p>

<p>The parents of this unfortunate
child, having heard of the miracles
of Lourdes, had procured some of
the water from the grotto; and in the
course of a fortnight had applied it
on three different occasions to the
body of the little fellow without obtaining
any effect. But their faith
was not discouraged on that account;
if hope was banished from the world,
it would still remain in the hearts of
mothers. A fourth application was
made on Holy Thursday, the first of
April, 1858. That day the child took
several steps without assistance.</p>

<p>The bathings from that time became
more and more efficacious, and
the health of the patient gradually
improved. After three or four weeks,
he became strong enough to walk
almost as well as other people. We
say "almost," for there was still in
his gait a certain awkwardness, which
seemed like a reminiscence of his
original infirmity. The thinness of
his legs had slowly disappeared together
with their weakness, and the
deformity of his chest was almost
entirely gone. All the people of the
village of Gez, knowing his previous
condition, said that it was a miracle.
Were they right or wrong? Whatever
our own opinion may be, there
is certainly much to be said on both
sides of the question.</p>

<p>Another child, Denys Bouchet, of
the town of Lamarque, in the canton
of Ossun, had also been cured
of a general paralysis in very much
the same way. A young man of
twenty-seven years, Jean Louis
Amaré, who was subject to epileptic
fits, had been completely though gradually
cured of his terrible malady
solely by the use of the water of
Massabielle.</p>

<p>Some other similar cases had also
occurred.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>If we were not acquainted with
the wonderfully varied forms which
supernatural cures have assumed since
the Christian era, we might perhaps
be inclined to believe that Providence
had thus disposed things at this moment
to cause proud human philosophy
to catch itself in its own nets,
and to destroy itself with its own
hands. But let us not think that
there was in this case such a snare
on the part of God. He lies in ambush
for no one. But truth in its
normal and regular developments, the
logic of which is unknown to human
philosophy, is of itself an eternal snare
for error.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p>However this may be, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i>
and physicians of the country hastened
to find in these various cures, the
cause of which was doubtful, though
their reality and progressive nature
were well ascertained, an admirable
opportunity and an excellent pretext
to effect that change of base which
the increasing evidence of facts made
absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Ceasing, therefore, to ascribe these
cures to such a commonplace cause
as imagination, they loudly attributed
them to the natural virtues which
this remarkable water, which had been
discovered by the merest chance, undoubtedly
possessed. To give this
explanation was of course equivalent
to recognizing the cures.</p>

<p>Let the reader recall the beginning
of this story, when a little shepherdess,
going out to gather some dead
wood, claimed to have seen a shining
apparition. Let him remember the
sneers of the great men of Lourdes,
the shrugging of shoulders at the
club, the supreme contempt with
which these strong-minded individuals
received this childish nonsense; what
progress the supernatural had made;
and how much incredulity, science,
and philosophy had lost, since the
first events which had so suddenly
occurred at the lonely grotto on the
banks of the Gave.</p>

<p>The miraculous had, if we may
use such an expression, taken the offensive.
Free thought, lately so
proud and confident in its attacks,
was now pursued by facts and obliged
to defend itself.</p>

<p>The representatives of philosophy
and science were none the less positive,
however, and showed as much
disdain as ever for the popular superstition.</p>

<p>"Well, be it so," said they, affecting
a tone of good humor and the
air of good faith. "We acknowledge
that the water of the grotto cures
certain maladies. What can be more
simple? What need is there of having
recourse to miracles, supernatural graces,
and divine intervention to explain
effects similar to, if not even exactly
the same as, those of the thousand
springs which, from Vichy or Baden-Baden
to Luchon, act with such efficacy
on the human system? The
Massabielle water has merely some
very powerful mineral qualities, like
those which are found in the springs
of Barèges or Cauterets, a little higher
up in the mountains. The grotto
of Lourdes has no connection with
religion, but comes within the province
of medical science."</p>

<p>A letter, which we take at random
from our documents, presents better
than we could the attitude of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> of the neighborhood regarding
the wonders worked by the Massabielle
water. This letter, written
by an eminent physician of that region,
Dr. Lary, who had no faith
whatever in the miraculous explanations
of the cures, was addressed
by him to a member of the faculty:</p>

<blockquote>


<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Ossun</span>, April 28, 1858.</p>


<p>"I hasten, my dear sir, to send you the
details which you ask of me in regard to
the case of the woman Galop of our
commune.</p>

<p>"This woman, in consequence of rheumatism
in the left hand, had lost the
power of holding anything with it. Hence,
if she wished to wash or carry a glass
with this hand, she was very apt to drop
it, and she was obliged to give up drawing
water from the well, because this
hand was unable to hold the rope. For
more than eight months she had not
made her bed and had not spun a single
skein of thread.</p>

<p>"Now, after a single journey to Lourdes,
where she made use of the water internally
and externally, she spins with ease,
<i>makes her bed, draws water, washes and
carries the glasses and dishes, and, in short,
uses this hand as well as the other</i>.</p>

<p>"The movements of the left hand are
not yet <em>quite</em> as free as before the illness,
but 90 per cent. of the power that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
been lost before the use of the water from
the grotto at Lourdes has been restored.
The woman proposes, however, to go
again to the grotto. I shall ask her to
pass your way that you may see her, and
convince yourself of all that I have said.</p>

<p>"You will find, in examining her case,
an incomplete anchylosis of the lower
joint of the forefinger. If the repeated
use of the water of the grotto destroys
this morbid condition, it will be an additional
proof of its alkaline properties.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>"In conclusion, I beg you to believe me
yours very faithfully,</p>


<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Lary</span>, M.D."
</p></blockquote>

<p>This explanation, once admitted
and considered as certain in advance,
the doctors were less unwilling to accept
the cures worked by the water
of the grotto; and from this period
they set to work to generalize their
thesis, and to apply it almost without
any distinction to all cases, even to
those which were marked by the
most amazing rapidity, which could
by no means be ascribed to the ordinary
action of mineral waters. The
learned personages of the place got
out of this difficulty by attributing to
the water of the grotto extremely
powerful properties, such as had been
previously unknown. It mattered
little that they discarded all the laws
of nature in their theories, provided
that heaven got no profit thence.
They willingly admitted the preternatural
in order to get rid of the supernatural.</p>

<p>There were among the faithful
some perverse and troublesome persons,
who by impertinent remarks interfered
with the profound conclusions
of the scientific coterie.</p>

<p>"How," they said, "is it that this
mineral spring, so extraordinarily powerful
that it works instantaneous cures,
was found by Bernadette when in a
state of ecstasy, and came after her
accounts of certain celestial visions,
and apparently in support of them?
How did it happen that the fountain
sprang out precisely at the moment
when Bernadette believed herself to
hear a heavenly voice telling her to
drink and bathe? And how is it
that this fountain, which appeared
suddenly under the eyes of all the
people in such very unusual circumstances,
yields not ordinary water,
but a water which, as you yourselves
acknowledge, has already cured so
many sick persons whose cases had
been abandoned as hopeless, and
who have used it without medical
advice, and merely in the spirit of religious
faith?"</p>

<p>These objections, repeated under
many different forms, provoked the
free-thinkers, philosophers, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i>
exceedingly. They tried to
evade them by answers which were
really so poor and miserable that
they ought, one would think, to have
hardly presented a good appearance
even in their authors' eyes; but then,
to find any others was no doubt very
difficult.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said they. "Coffee
was discovered by a goat. A shepherd
found by chance the waters of
Luchon. It was also by accident
that the ruins of Pompeii were
brought to light by the pickaxe of a
laborer. Why should we be so much
surprised that this little girl, while
amusing herself by digging in the
ground during her hallucination,
should have come upon a spring, and
that the water of this spring should
be mineral and alkaline? That she
imagined at the moment that the
Blessed Virgin was before her, and
that she heard a voice directing her
to the fountain, is merely a coincidence,
entirely accidental, but of
which superstition tries to make a
miracle. On this occasion, as on the
others, chance has done everything,
and has been the real discoverer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>The faithful were not, however,
moved by this sort of argument.
They had the bad taste to think that
to explain everything by accidental
coincidence was to do violence to
reason under the pretext of defending
it. This irritated the free-thinkers,
who, though acknowledging at
last the reality of the cures, deplored
more than ever the religious and supernatural
character which the common
people insisted upon giving to
these strange events; and, as was natural
under the circumstances, they
were inclined to resort to force to
stop the popular movement. "If
these waters are mineral," they began
to say, "they belong to the state
or to the municipality; people should
not use them except by the advice of
a doctor; and an establishment for
baths should be built at the spot,
not a chapel."</p>

<p>The science of Lourdes, forced to
assent to the facts in this case, had
arrived at the state of mind just described
when the measures of the
prefect, relative to the objects deposited
in the grotto, and the attempt
to imprison Bernadette under
the pretext of insanity, were announced&mdash;this
attempt, as we have
seen, having been defeated by the
unexpected intervention of the curé,
M. Peyramale.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>A certain and official basis for all
these theses of the desperate adherents
of the medical theory was still
a desideratum. M. Massy had already
bethought himself of asking
such a basis from one of the most
wonderful and indubitable sciences
of the age&mdash;namely, that of chemistry.
With this view, he had applied,
through the mayor of Lourdes, to a
chemist of some distinction in the
department&mdash;M. Latour de Trie.</p>

<p>To show, not in detail by the examination
of each special case, but
once for all, that these cures which
were rising up as formidable objections
were naturally explained by the
chemical constitution of the new
spring, seemed to him a masterstroke;
and he considered that, in
accomplishing it, he would lay science
and philosophy under obligation,
not to mention also the administration,
represented by the minister,
M. Rouland.</p>

<p>Seeing that it was impossible to
have Bernadette arrested as insane,
he urged the analysis, which was to
show officially the mineral and healing
qualities of the water. It was
becoming imperatively necessary to
get rid of the intrusive supernatural
power which, after having produced
the fountain, was now curing the sick
people, and threatening to pass all
bounds. Though its abominable influence
should continue strong in
many quarters, a really official analysis
might be of great service.</p>

<p>The chemist of the prefecture,
therefore, set to work to make this
precious investigation of the water
from Massabielle, and, with a good
conscience, if not with perfect science,
he found at the bottom of his
crucibles a solution perfectly agreeing
with the explanations of the doctors,
the reasonings of the philosophers,
and the desires of the prefect.
But was truth also as well satisfied
with it as the prefecture, the philosophers,
and the faculty? At first,
perhaps, this question was not proposed,
but it lay in store for a future
occasion. But, not to consider this
for the present, let us see what was
this analysis which M. Latour de
Trie, chemist of the administration,
addressed officially, on the 6th of
May, to the mayor of Lourdes, and
which the latter immediately forwarded
to the Baron Massy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"CHEMICAL ANALYSIS.</p>

<p>"The water of the grotto of Lourdes
is very clear, without smell or decided
taste. Its specific gravity is very nearly
that of distilled water. Its temperature
at the spring is 15° Cent. (59° Fahr.)</p>

<p>"It contains the following elements:</p>

<p>"1st. Chlorides of sodium, calcium
and magnesium in abundance.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>"2d. Carbonates of lime and of magnesia.</p>

<p>"3d. Silicates of lime and of alumina.</p>

<p>"4th. Oxide of iron.</p>

<p>"5th. Sulphate and carbonate of soda.</p>

<p>"6th. Phosphate (traces).</p>

<p>"7th. Organic matter&mdash;ulmine.</p>

<p>"The complete absence of sulphate of
lime in this water is also established by
this analysis.</p>

<p>"This remarkable peculiarity is entirely
to its advantage, and entitles it to be
considered as very favorable to digestion,
and as giving to the animal economy a
disposition favorable to the equilibrium
of the vital action.</p>

<p>"We do not think it imprudent to say,
in consideration of the number and quality
of the substances which compose it,
that medical science will, perhaps, soon
recognize in it special curative properties
which will entitle it to be classed among
the waters which constitute the mineral
wealth of our department.</p>

<p>"Be pleased to accept, etc.</p>


<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">A. Latour de Trie.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>The civil order is not so well disciplined
as the military, and, through
misunderstanding, false steps are occasionally
taken in it. The prefect,
in the multitude of his avocations,
had omitted to give his orders to the
editors of the official newspaper of
the department, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ere Impériale</i>,
so that, while the chemist of the prefecture
said white, its journalist said
black; while the former was recognizing
in the spring at Lourdes one
of the future medical and mineral
treasures of the Pyrenees, the latter
was calling it dirty water, and joking
about the cures which had been
obtained.</p>

<p>"It is needless to say," he wrote
on the precise day on which M. Latour
de Trie sent in his report&mdash;that
is, on the 6th of May&mdash;"that the
famous grotto turns out miracles in
abundance, and that our department
is inundated with them. At every
corner you will meet with people
who tell you of a thousand cures
obtained by the use of some dirty
water.</p>

<p>"The doctors will soon have nothing
to do, and the rheumatic and
consumptive people will have disappeared
from the department," etc.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these discrepancies,
which might have been avoided,
it must be acknowledged that Baron
Massy was, on the whole, attentive
to his business. On the 4th of May,
at about noon, he had delivered his
address to the mayors of the canton
of Lourdes, and given his orders.
On the 4th of May, in the evening,
the grotto had been stripped of the
offerings and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex-votos</i>. On the
morning of the 5th, he had ascertained
the impossibility of having Bernadette
arrested, and had abandoned
this measure. On the 6th, in the
evening, he received the analysis of
his chemist. Fortified with this important
document, he waited the
course of events.</p>

<p>What was about to take place at
Lourdes? What would happen at
the grotto? What would be done
by Bernadette, whose every movement
was watched by the Argus eyes
of Jacomet and of his agents? Would
not the fountain at the grotto disappear
in the coming hot weather, and
thus put an end to the whole business?
What attitude would the people
assume? Such were the hopes
and anxieties of the Baron Massy,
imperial prefect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>At the grotto the miraculous fountain
continued to flow, abundant and
clear, with that character of quiet
perpetuity which is generally found
in springs coming from the rock.</p>

<p>The supernatural apparition did
not cease to assert its existence, and
to prove it by benefits conferred.</p>

<p>The grace of God continued to
descend visibly and invisibly upon the
people, sometimes quick as the lightning
which flashes through the clouds,
sometimes gradual like the light of
dawn.</p>

<p>We can only speak of those graces
which were external and manifest.</p>

<p>At six or seven kilometres (four
miles) from Lourdes, at Loubajac,
lived a good woman, a peasant, who
had formerly been accustomed to labor,
but whom an accident had for
eighteen months past reduced to a
most painful inaction. Her name
was Catherine Latapie-Chouat. In
October, 1856, having climbed an
oak to knock down some acorns, she
had lost her balance, and suffered a
violent fall, which caused a severe
dislocation of the right arm and
hand. The reduction&mdash;as is stated
in the report and the official statement,
which are now before us&mdash;though
performed immediately by
an able surgeon, and though it
nearly restored the arm to its normal
state, had nevertheless not prevented
an extreme weakness in it. The
most intelligent and continuous treatment
had been ineffectual in removing
the stiffness of the three most important
fingers of the hand. The
thumb and first two fingers remained
obstinately bent and paralyzed, so
that it was impossible either to
straighten them or to enable them to
move in the least. The unfortunate
peasant, still young enough for much
labor, for she was hardly thirty-eight,
could not sew, spin, knit, or take care
of the house. The doctor, after having
treated her case for a long time without
success, had told her that it was
incurable, and that she must resign
herself to give up the use of that
hand. This sentence, from such a
reliable authority, was for the poor
woman the announcement of an irreparable
misfortune. The poor have
no resource but work; for them compulsory
inaction is inevitable misery.</p>

<p>Catherine had become pregnant
nine or ten months after the accident,
and her time was approaching at the
date of our narrative. One night she
awaked with a sudden thought or inspiration.
"An interior spirit," to
quote her own words to myself,
"said to me as it were with irresistible
force, 'Go to the grotto! go to
the grotto, and you will be cured!'"
Who this mysterious being was who
spoke thus, and whom this ignorant
peasant&mdash;ignorant at least as far as
human knowledge is concerned&mdash;called
a "spirit," is no doubt known
by her angel guardian.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock in the morning.
Catherine called two of her
children who were large enough to
accompany her.</p>

<p>"Do you remain to work," said
she to her husband. "I am going
to the grotto."</p>

<p>"In your present condition it is
impossible," replied he; "to go to
Lourdes and return is full three
leagues."</p>

<p>"Nothing is impossible. I am going
to get cured."</p>

<p>No objection had the least effect
upon her, and she set out with her
two children. It was a fine moonlight
night; but the awful silence,
occasionally broken by strange and
mysterious sounds, the solitude of
the plains only dimly visible, and
seemingly peopled by vague forms,
terrified the children. They trembled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and would have stopped at every
step had not Catherine reassured
them. She had no fear, and felt that
she was going to the fountain of
life.</p>

<p>She arrived at Lourdes at daybreak,
and happened to meet Bernadette.
Some one telling her who it
was, Catherine, without saying
anything, approached the child
blessed by the Lord and beloved by
Mary, and touched her dress humbly.
Then she continued her journey
to the rocks of Massabielle, where,
in spite of the early hour, a great
many pilgrims were already assembled
and were on their knees.</p>

<p>Catherine and her children also
knelt and prayed. Then she rose,
and quietly bathed her hand in the
marvellous water.</p>

<p>Her fingers immediately straightened,
became flexible, and under her
control. The Blessed Virgin had
cured the incurable.</p>

<p>What did Catherine do? She was
not surprised. She did not utter a
cry, but again fell on her knees, and
gave thanks to God and to Mary.
For the first time for eighteen months,
she prayed with her hands joined, and
clasped the resuscitated fingers with
the others.</p>

<p>She remained thus for a long time,
absorbed in an act of thanksgiving.
Such moments are sweet; the soul is
glad to forget itself, and thinks that
it is in Paradise.</p>

<p>But violent sufferings recalled Catherine
to the earth&mdash;this earth of
sighs and tears, where the curse pronounced
upon the guilty mother of
the human race has never ceased to
be felt by her innumerable posterity.
We have said that Catherine was
very near her confinement, and as
she was still upon her knees she
found herself suddenly seized by the
terrible pains of childbirth. She
shuddered, seeing that there would
be no time to go even to Lourdes,
and that her delivery was about to
occur in the presence of the surrounding
multitude. And for a moment
she looked around with terror and
anguish.</p>

<p>But this terror did not last long.</p>

<p>Catherine returned to the Queen
whom nature obeys.</p>

<p>"Good Mother," said she simply,
"you have just shown me so great a
favor, I know you will spare me the
shame of being delivered before all
these people, and at least grant that
I may return home before giving birth
to my child."</p>

<p>Immediately all her pains ceased,
and the interior spirit of whom she
spoke to us, and who, we believe, was
her angel guardian, said to her:</p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed. Set out
with confidence; you will arrive safely."</p>

<p>"Let us go home now," said Catherine
to her two children.</p>

<p>Accordingly she took the road to
Loubajac, holding them by the hand,
without intimating to any one her
critical state, and without showing
any uneasiness, even to the midwife
of her own village, who happened to
be there in the midst of the crowd
of pilgrims. With inexpressible happiness
she quietly traversed the long
and rough road which separated
her from home. The two children
were not afraid of it now; the sun
was risen, and their mother was
cured.</p>

<p>As soon as she returned, she wished
still to pray; but immediately her
pains returned. In a quarter of an
hour she was the mother of a third
son.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>At the same time, a woman of Lamarque,
Marianne Garrot, had been
relieved in less than ten days, merely
by lotions with the water from the
grotto, of a white eruption which had
covered her whole face, and which
for two years had resisted all treatment.
Dr. Amadou, of Pontacq, her
physician, was satisfied of the fact,
and was an incontestable witness of
it subsequently before the episcopal
commission.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>At Bordères, near Nay, the widow
Marie Lanou-Domengé, eighty years
old, had been for three years a sufferer
from an incomplete paralysis in the
whole left side. She could not take
a step without assistance, and was
unable to do any work.</p>

<p>Dr. Poueymiroo, of Mirepoix, after
having ineffectually used some
remedies to restore life in the palsied
parts, though continuing his visits,
had abandoned medical treatment of
the case.</p>

<p>Hope, however, is with difficulty
extinguished in the hearts of the sick.</p>

<p>"When shall I get well?" the good
woman would say to Dr. Poueymiroo,
every time that he came.</p>

<p>"You will get well when the good
God sees fit," was the invariable reply
of the doctor, who was far from suspecting
the prophetic nature of his words.</p>

<p>"Why should I not believe what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
he says, and throw myself directly
on the divine goodness?" said the
old peasant woman one day to herself,
when she heard people talking
of the fountain of Massabielle.</p>

<p>Accordingly, she sent some one to
Lourdes to get at the spring itself a
little of this healing water.</p>

<p>When it was brought to her, she
was much excited.</p>

<p>"Take me out of bed," said she,
"and hold me up."</p>

<p>They took her out, and dressed
her hurriedly. Both the actors and
spectators in this scene were somewhat
disturbed.</p>

<p>Two persons held her up, placing
their hands under her shoulders.</p>

<p>A glass of water from the grotto
was presented to her.</p>

<p>She extended her trembling hand
toward the quickening water and
dipped her fingers in it. Then she
made a great sign of the cross on
herself, raised the glass to her lips,
and slowly drank the contents, no
doubt absorbed in fervent and silent
prayer.</p>

<p>She became so pale that they
thought for the moment that she was
going to faint.</p>

<p>But while they were exerting themselves
to prevent her from falling, she
rose with a quick and joyful movement
and looked around. Then
she cried out with a voice of triumph:</p>

<p>"Let me go&mdash;quick! I am cured."</p>

<p>Those who were holding her withdrew
their arms partially and with
some hesitation. She immediately
freed herself from them, and walked
with as much confidence as if she
had never been ill.</p>

<p>Some one, however, who still had
some fear of the result, offered her a
stick to lean on.</p>

<p>She looked at it with a smile; then
took it and contemptuously threw it
far away, as a thing which was no
longer of use. And from that day,
she employed herself as before in
hard out-door work.</p>

<p>Some visitors, who came to see
her and to convince themselves of the
fact, asked her to walk in their presence.</p>

<p>"Walk, did you say? I will run
for you!" And, true to her word,
she began to run.</p>

<p>This occurred in the month of
May. In the following July, the
people pointed out the vigorous octogenarian
as a curiosity, as she mowed
the grain, and was by no means
the last in the hard labors of the
harvest.</p>

<p>Her physician, the excellent Dr.
Poueymiroo, praised God for this
evident miracle, and subsequently,
with the examining commission, signed
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</span> on the extraordinary
events which we have just
related, in which he did not hesitate
to recognize "the direct and evident
action of divine power."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<h2>OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBORS.</h2>


<p>In the adjustment of differences
to which conflicting interests or a
spirit of rivalry may give birth, governments,
like individuals, are prone
to satisfy themselves with conventions
limited to matters immediately
in dispute. They are like medical
doctors, who treat symptoms as the
malady to be cured, and, satisfied
with alleviating present pain, leave
its causes to war against mortal life,
until disease becomes chronic and incurable.</p>

<p>Whether the labors of the Joint
High Commission, now sitting in
Washington, will be of this description,
remains to be seen; but
such, it appears to us, has been
the character of treaties or conventions
affecting commercial relations
with our Canadian and provincial
neighbors. They seem not to have
been founded upon any intelligent
consideration of the wants of contracting
parties, but, presupposing
that there must be conflicting
interests, are devised to prevent rival
industries from merging in unfriendliness
and strife. We ask, then,
whether these rival interests have legitimate
existence. The answer to
this question will be derived from an
examination of the statistics of the
two countries&mdash;their agricultural and
other products&mdash;their climatic and
social conditions, and the commercial
relations actually subsisting between
them, as well as those which
both sustain to other countries and
peoples.</p>

<p>The productions of a country are
properly classified according to the
sources whence they are derived.</p>

<p>We have, then, five distinct classes
of products, namely: The natural
productions of the sea, the earth, the
forest, and the results of industry
applied to agriculture and manufactures.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to the map of
British America. Beginning at the
east, the waters of Newfoundland and
the Gulf of St. Lawrence are rich in
fisheries. They yield salmon, mackerel,
codfish, haddock, ling, herring,
and oysters, in great abundance.
Newfoundland has not enough of
agriculture to save its own population
from absolute suffering when
there is a failure in the catch of fish
along its shores. It possesses rich
though undeveloped deposits of copper,
iron, and other ores. Prince
Edward Island, in the centre of the
mackerel fisheries, is, perhaps, more
favored by nature than the other maritime
provinces. Every acre of its
surface may be reckoned as arable
land. Its agriculture, always limited
to the growth of hay, oats, potatoes,
and turnips, is only partially developed,
though even now yielding
a considerable surplus for export.
Its forests are exhausted of timber.
And though, from habit, its people
still continue to build wooden ships
to send "home" for sale, they are
obliged to import the material for
their construction. The southern
part of Nova Scotia contains a considerable
portion of good farm lands;
yielding the invariable crops of hay,
oats, potatoes, and turnips. In
some districts, apples and pears,
of excellent quality, are grown in
abundance. The eastern portion,
especially the island of Cape Breton,
is rich in coal, lime, freestone,
and marble; all so placed as to be
easily accessible to commerce. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
now, despite protective duties on colonial
products, the streets of some
of our Atlantic cities are lighted
with gas from Nova Scotia coal.</p>

<p>Gold has been found in sufficient
quantity to afford opportunity for
speculation, but not for profit. The
yield for 1867 was 27,583 oz. =
$413,745; for 1868, 20,541 oz. =
$308,115. The same amount of
capital applied to the growing of potatoes
would doubtless afford a much
larger return. Coal is the most important
mineral product; and its
chief market is found in the United
States. The net amount mined in
one year was 418,313 tons; sold
for home consumption and to neighboring
colonies, 176,392 tons; sent
to the United States, 241,921 tons.</p>

<p>New Brunswick offers the same
agricultural products as the neighboring
provinces of Prince Edward
Island and Nova Scotia. A great
part of its territory, like the northern
part of Maine, is cold, rocky, and
inarable. But its forests yield large
quantities of pine lumber, oak, beech,
maple, and other valuable woods,
and bark for tanning leather. This
source of wealth is, however, rapidly
failing. The forests begin to give
evidence of exhaustion. St. John
already asks what shall be her resource
when the lumber is gone.
Formerly, ship-building was a large
interest in these lower provinces.
But from the growing scarcity of
ship timber, as well as from the more
general use of iron vessels, it has
been declining from year to year.</p>

<p>We see, then, what these provinces
can now contribute to commerce;
and we also see their prime deficiency.
They cannot supply their people
with bread. That comes from
Canada and the United States.
But Canada does not want their
mackerel or other fish, their oats,
potatoes, turnips, or hay. She wants
money; and for want of a nearer
market, the surplus oats must
be sent upon a very doubtful venture
across the ocean, the mackerel
to the United States, and the
dried fish to the West Indies and
Brazil, to get money to pay for Canadian
bread. But time is money.
It is more than money&mdash;it is life.
And when we take into account the
loss of time in going to and fro across
the ocean, and the great expenditure
of unproductive labor that is required
by this selling to Peter on one side
of the world to pay Paul on the other,
we cannot help believing that the
poor provincial pays a high price for
bread to eat and clothes to wear, as
well as for the various products of
other lands which, from being only
conveniences, have become the necessaries
of life.</p>

<p>We come now to the Province
of Quebec&mdash;prior to the Dominion,
called Canada East. Nearly all her
territory lies north of the forty-sixth
parallel of latitude. Need we say that
agriculture, save for the few and slender
productions of cold climates, is
here impossible? For nearly seven
months of the year the greater part
of her rivers and harbors are closed
to commerce by bars of impenetrable
ice. The soil, and every industry
relating to it, is under the dominion
of frost.</p>

<p>The forests of timber may be accessible
despite the snows of winter, and
in the early spring her people may
hunt seals along the coasts of Labrador;
but during the long period of
actual winter, her agriculturists, nearly
her whole industrial population,
must be employed upon indoor labor,
or be left to hibernate in positive
idleness. It is simply impossible
that agriculture can ever be a
successful industry in so rigorous a
climate as that of Quebec.</p>

<p>Going westward through what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was once called Canada West, now
the Province of Ontario, we find a
peninsula bounded by the St. Lawrence
River, Lake Ontario, and Lake
Erie, on the south and east; and by
Lakes St. Clair and Huron, with their
connecting straits, on the west. This
peninsula, south of 45° N., comprises
the wheat-growing lands of Canada
east of Lake Winnipeg. Its area is
something less than that of the State
of New York. It produces good crops
of wheat and other cereals, and nearly
all vegetables and fruits grown in
our northern and northwestern states.
Farther west, we have the valleys of
the Saskatchewan and its tributaries,
capable of producing cereals, grasses,
potatoes, and other vegetables. But
our information, derived from missionaries
and others long resident in
that region, induces the belief that it
is mere folly to regard a country in
whose streams the fish lie torpid, and
where the snow-fall is not enough to
protect the land from killing frosts,
in winter, as suited to the growth of
cereals for export, or as capable of
giving bread to any considerable
population.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written
concerning the territory lying on the
Pacific coast. We believe it is well
ascertained that the climate of British
Columbia west of the mountains&mdash;we
might well add the southeast
coast of Alaska&mdash;is as mild as that of
the state of New York. Unfortunately,
it is very much more moist;
so much more that it never can become
a good agricultural country.
The reason is so obvious that one is
hardly disposed to question the assertion.
The vast accumulations of ice
and snow in and immediately north
of Behring Strait, and on the high
mountain range lying on the east side
of this territory, must produce intense
cold when the wind blows from the
north and east. When the warm air
comes from the southwest, the whole
atmosphere must resemble a vapor-bath.
Seeds may readily germinate,
but can they produce ripe crops?</p>

<p>We have recently discussed this
subject with a friend who has had
intimate personal acquaintance with
this coast for more than ten years,
and we but reiterate his assertion
in saying that, north of Oregon, agriculture
is not a safe reliance for the
support of a colony. We do not
doubt that hay, oats, and potatoes
will grow there. It is well known
that they may grow where the sub-soil
is everlasting ice. But we know
that agriculture cannot be profitable
either there or where the heats of
summer last just long enough to melt
the snows on adjacent mountains
and convert the soil to mud. There
must always be an excess of moisture
to contend with in maturing
crops. Our information as to the
fact is positive. But suppose that,
in process of time, by the clearing
of forest lands, and other causes incident
to the peopling and cultivation
of the soil, these difficulties were
overcome. Does any one believe
that the products of the land could
be carried by rail and inland waters
through a distance of three
thousand miles, and two or three
thousand more by sea, and, after
successive reshipments, at last pay
the producer&mdash;save in cumulation of
expenses added to the original cost
of goods received in return? If,
then, this far western country should
ever have an excess of food or other
commodities, they must find a readier
market than either the far-off
country of eastern Canada or more
distant lands can afford. Its trade
must be with the neighboring states
of Washington, Oregon, and California.
Will the people, on either side,
long consent to pay tribute to government
officials for the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of exchanging the fruits of their
toil?</p>

<p>Were they really of different races&mdash;distinct
in language, manners, and
customs beyond the degree that always
makes the dwellers in one village
imagine its "excellent society"
a little superior to that of the neighboring
hamlet&mdash;we might say, yes!
But knowing, as we do, that they
are by race, by conditions of soil
and climate, and by reason of mutual
interests, but one people, we do
not believe it.</p>

<p>Let us now glance at the map of
the United States. Leaving out
Maine, northern New Hampshire,
and Vermont, in the northeast; the
narrow belt north of the 48th parallel,
between Lake Superior and the
Pacific Ocean, in the northwest;
Florida, Louisiana, and Southern
Texas in the south; the whole vast
area between the 32d and 46th parallels
of latitude, from the Atlantic
to the Pacific Ocean&mdash;in extent equivalent
to three-fourths of all Europe&mdash;is
suited to the production of wheat,
rye, barley, Indian corn, oats, hay,
potatoes, and every fruit found in
temperate climates. There are no
frosts to render agriculture a mere
speculative enterprise; no bonds of
ice to close the ports to commerce.
Seed-time and harvest may be counted
upon as certainly as the succession
of seasons. Can there be a
doubt that here the material interest
forming the basis of all others
is agriculture? We have no exact
data for a comparison of the several
products of the United States and
British America; but for our immediate
purpose it is quite unnecessary
to present tables of statistics. We
refer only to chief products. First&mdash;of
those common to both countries,
the productions of the United States
are to the productions of Canada
and the Lower Provinces as 13 to 1.
The whole agricultural products of
the United States, excluding those
of orchards, vineyards, and gardens&mdash;which
would present a still wider
difference&mdash;are to those of Canada
as 15 to 1. The annual yield of Indian
corn in the United States is
worth upwards of $800,000,000, or
about five times the entire value of
the agricultural product of British
America. If we include in the comparison
the values of animals and
animal products, orchards, vineyards,
and gardens, the proportion is something
nearer 30 to 1, while the breadth
of improved land is not as 10 to 1.
And this while the breadth of our
improved land is not more than one-thirteenth
of our territory&mdash;though
double the whole area of Great Britain
and Ireland&mdash;and while any
great expansion of agriculture in Canada
is forbidden by the conditions
of soil and climate. Are not these
considerations sufficient to show the
absurdity of persistence in the development
of <i>rivalry</i> in agricultural
and commercial interests? Do we
not see that in the United States
agriculture is legitimately the greatest
industrial interest, and that in
Canada it is not? And we may
well ask why the industrial population
of Canada should not be employed
in utilizing its timber and
other products of the forest and the
mine, or, where material is more readily
found in the neighboring country,
using the forces so abundantly
provided by their inland waters and
mines of coal, as well as by the muscle
half-wasted for want of use, in
supplying fabrics which they now
import, and pay for by the scanty
labors of just half the time that God
has given them? These considerations
are in some degree applicable
to New England. The difference is,
that New England knows it, and acts
upon the knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Manufacturing is the appropriate
industry of cold climates. When this
is acknowledged, hibernation ceases.
The people are no longer forced to
eke out a meagre existence in winter
upon the slender profits of toil spent
in contention with chilling winds and
frosts. True, Canada&mdash;a small part
of it&mdash;produces bread for export.
We know it: and we also know that
every loaf costs twice as much, in
human toil, as the better loaf yielded
by the more generous soils and genial
suns of Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa,
New York, Ohio, Maryland, Virginia,
and California. Canada produces
good beef, mutton, pork, and,
of course, the raw materials for manufactures
incident to these products.
But the herdsmen on the plains
of Illinois, Iowa, Florida, and Texas
would grow rich in selling beeves,
swine, and sheep for the cost of their
keeping through a Canadian winter!</p>

<p>On the other hand, we see, in
some parts of our own country, whole
communities of people engaged in
mechanical industries, while the earth
calls for tillage. Even in our more
populous territories, enough of what
should be fruitful lands to yield subsistence
to a larger population than
Canada will ever contain, lies fallow
and neglected. But our commercial
relations are adverse to the proper
adjustment of industrial pursuits.</p>

<p>The Canadians dare not rely upon
their neighbors for bread to eat, any
more than those neighbors would
venture to build their workshops and
factories in Canada. The more venturesome
try to obviate the difficulty,
to some extent, by illicit trade;
but all the obstacles to legitimate
commerce&mdash;to the conveniences of
living&mdash;remain; and they must remain
as long as the American and
Canadian producers have to pay tribute
to Cæsar on exchanging the
fruits of their labors. Reciprocity
treaties may modify, but they cannot
remove, this great obstacle to prosperous
trade.</p>

<p>Treaties regulating trade cannot
so change the industries of the two
countries as to confine large agricultural
enterprises to the soil and climate
that would insure success, nor
send the artisan, now living on rich
uncultivated lands, to till the earth.
What means the extraordinary emigration
from Canada to the States?
And how can we account for the sudden
expansion of manufacturing industries
in Montreal and other Canadian
towns? It means that, while governments
are discussing treaties for reciprocal
trade, their people are practising
reciprocal emigration&mdash;but with a
difference. The Canadian becomes an
American citizen&mdash;the American very
rarely a British subject. We recollect
two incidents in our own experience
apropos to the matter under consideration.</p>

<p>Some two years ago we passed a
summer in the "Lower Provinces."
In the parlor of our hotel, we fell into
conversation with an intelligent
man of business who proved to be
a commercial traveller from Canada.
His specialty was boots and shoes.
On mentioning that Lynn, in Massachusetts,
was the great shoe factory
of "the States," his reply was, "Yes!
the head of our firm is from Lynn."
Lynn had gone to Montreal to employ
Canadian hands in turning Canadian
leather into boots and shoes
to supply colonial markets. "The
head of our firm," like other heads
of firms, had solved the problem of
appropriate industry as far as he was
concerned. He had learned where
material, and hands to work it, were
cheapest, and he was utilizing them.
He had emigrated to employ the
cheap labor that could not emigrate.
At another time, we met a well-dressed
mechanic who was not at <em>home</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
His home was in "the States."
He was only visiting his birthplace
and kindred. In reply to the remark
that the high wages which had enticed
him to the States were only high
in sound, since greenbacks were at a
great discount, and food, clothing,
and rent at inflated prices, his reply
evinced a perfect understanding of
the whole question, as it affected him
and the class to which he belonged.</p>

<p>"True," said he, "I am paid in
greenbacks; but I have a better
house, better food, and better clothes
than I ever had before. And at the
end of the year, my surplus greenbacks
are worth more, <em>in gold</em>, than I
could get for a year's labor in this
colony."</p>

<p>Here are two parties whose interests
are reciprocal, whose social conditions
are essentially the same, who
live in juxtaposition to each other,
but with broad ocean between them
and other countries and peoples, frittering
away material interests, wasting
revenues that of right should be
employed for their advancement in
social life, to gratify a spirit of antagonism
where even rivalry should be
deemed insane. But is there no
remedy for these disorders in our
political economy? We think there
is a very obvious one; and if we may
not say, "What God has joined together,
let not man put asunder," because
the parties are not agreed, we
can and do say, the sooner they
are agreed, the better for both. We
would say to Canada, do not waste
your time and strength in trying to
effect impossibilities. Let us see
your many rivers alive with the artisans
who can send to the market
something else than ship-timber and
deals. Let us see the smoke of the
forge and the foundry rise in proximity
to your mines of coal. We
want all that you can make, and
have no fear that you will in any
degree impair the prosperity of our
own industrial people. And we will
pay you in bread, better and cheaper
than you can get from your colder
and less fruitful lands. And when
your coarser materials are wrought
into shape for export, we have skilled
labor, nearer than Britain, to receive
your surplus products and fashion
them into the thousand fabrics which
only skilled labor can supply.</p>

<p>We have no desire to see your
wheat-fields fail or to decry their products
in the market. We only say
that they are too limited for dangerous
competition with ours. And we
further say, that if you will but develop
other and more legitimate industries,
so that your wheat-growing
districts cannot feed your people, we
will be sure to have bread enough
and to spare. And you may be also
sure that all your efforts will not so
overstock the markets we can offer
as to make trade languish, when the
thousands now peopling this continent
shall become millions, though
the Old World should want nothing
that you can give. And, then, you
have but a doubtful road to the markets
of the Old World. For half the
year your highway to the ocean and
to other lands must be across our
territory. Intercolonial railways
through unsettled and unproductive
countries will not answer the demands
of commerce. They will not
pay; and, if they would, the interests
served ought not to be so burdened
where access may be had to
readier and cheaper lines of communication.</p>

<p>Does all this imply annexation?
Call it what you will. As one of
your Canadian statesmen said to the
people of a lesser province, "If you
do not want us to annex you, we are
willing that you should annex us."
If you are more conservative than
we are, a little conservatism will do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
us no harm; and the interests you
would conserve would be quite as
safe under the eagle's beak as under
the lion's paw. If one be a bird, the
other is surely a beast of prey; and
we believe that harmless folk have
less to apprehend from one alone
than from the jealous rivalries of
both.</p>

<p>Of one thing we feel assured: the
time is not far distant when the people
of this northern half of America
will have to adopt a policy so distinct
from that of the older nations
of Europe that self-preservation will
demand a union of power where
there is now an evident identity of
interests.</p>

<p>It were well that this union should
be preceded by such guarantees of
existing rights and privileges as
might, without specific and just conventions,
be open to subsequent
question and dispute. And it were
also well for governments to direct
the march which necessity compels
their people to make, rather than
incur the risk of finding themselves
at variance with those for whose
greater good civil government is
designed. We do not purpose to
discuss the origin or foundation of
civil government. It is enough for
us to know that man requires and God
wills it; and that, in the absence of
other and higher sanctions, the best
evidence of his will is found in the
intelligent, honest consent of the governed.
Does any one doubt what
the more intelligent and honest people
of Canada and the United States
require? We do not ask what may
be the <i>rôle</i> of the political adventurer,
the office-seeker, the government
speculator or tuft-hunter. We always
know that the end of all their loyalty
or patriotism is self. But we ask
what is needed for the greater good
of the people. Not alone the people
of to-day or to-morrow, but of
the future as well. How the people
of to-day esteem the policy of their
lawgivers, may be known by their
conduct under it. And the army of
government revenue officers and detectives
on either side along the
frontiers of Canada and "the States"
offers sufficient evidence of the esteem
in which the laws of trade
are held. We know not which is the
more corrupt&mdash;the law-breakers or
the agents of the law; but we do
know, from the notoriety of the fact,
that the commercial relations now
existing between the Canadas and
the States are, in effect, so demoralizing,
to commercial people and commercial
interests, that the laws which
propose to govern them were better
abrogated than left to offer a premium
to chicanery and fraud.</p>

<p>We are neither alarmists nor political
propagandists. We have no
greedy desire for our neighbor's goods,
no fanatical wish to impose our political
dogmas or theories upon the
people of other states. We but behold
and see what is before and
around us&mdash;and, seeing it, we only give
utterance to belief that has grown
and strengthened, until scarcely a
doubt remains, when we say that we
believe the ultimate union of the
United States and British America to
be inevitable. The time may be
more or less distant, the occasion and
the means may be as yet undreamed
of; but the event seems as certain
as the coming of the morrow's sun
while the shades of evening gather
over and around us. If, unfortunately,
war should take the place of
peaceful union, the calamity would
hardly be less to us than to Canada.</p>

<p>By peaceful union, existing rights
of the weaker party are made secure.
By war, they are jeopardized and
may be lost. But to us, as well as to
them, war would be a calamity of
such fearful magnitude, that we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
constrained to look with hope to the
time when the conflicting interests of
the Old World shall have no power
to disturb the peaceful relations
that should always exist between ourselves
and our neighbors.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ON THE HIGHER EDUCATION.<br />

<small>SECOND ARTICLE.</small></h2>


<p>The whole scope of the subject
properly comprised under the title
"Higher Education" obviously includes
all that belongs to every kind
of institute of learning above common
schools. We have selected this title
in order to leave freedom to ourselves
to discourse upon any part of
the subject we might think proper,
although in our first article we limited
our remarks to a class of schools intended
for that which is more strictly
to be designated as intermediate
education. We have a few additional
remarks to offer upon the same
part of our subject, after which we
will proceed to throw out a few suggestions
upon some of its remaining
and still more important portions.
We are not attempting to treat these
topics fully and minutely, and our
observations will be, therefore, brief
and desultory.</p>

<p>In regard to the course of studies
to be pursued in intermediate schools,
it is a question of great practical
moment how to arrange the several
branches to be taught to the pupils
in such a way as to prepare them
most efficiently for the future occupations
of their lives. The course
common to all ought to be made up
of those studies which are alike necessary
or important to all. In addition
to these common studies, certain
special branches should be taught, or
the distinct branches of the common
course more extensively carried out,
for distinct classes of pupils, varying
these optional studies according to
the different occupations for which
they are preparing. For instance, a
moderate quantity of mathematics
and a rudimental, general course of
instruction in physical sciences are sufficient
for all, except those who will
need greater knowledge and practice
in them for use in their profession.
It is useless to attempt, in these
days, education on the encyclopædic
principle. The common and solid
basis of all education once laid, the
more specific it becomes, the better;
and for want of good sense and skill
in selecting studies, apportioning the
relative time and labor given to them,
and directing them to a definite end,
very great waste and loss are incurred
in education.</p>

<p>One other most important point,
which we merely notice, is the propriety
of providing the most thorough
instruction in the modern languages,
especially the French, which can
more easily be done, as we suppose,
in the schools of which we are speaking,
that no time whatever, or at
most but a moderate amount, is
given to the ancient languages.
Without going further into details, it
is obvious that schools of the intermediate
class have an unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
sphere in which they can give any
kind and degree of instruction belonging
to the most extensive and
liberal education, deducting the classics,
and stopping short of the university,
properly so called. Nor is
there any reason why, if we had universities
in the highest sense of the
term, the pupils of these schools
should not afterward enjoy all the
privileges they offer which do not
require a knowledge of the ancient
languages. We will not say anything
on the vexed classical question.
Did it seem to be practicable, we
should strongly favor making the
study of Latin a part of the education
of all who go beyond the common
rudiments, as well girls as boys, to
such an extent that they could understand
the divine offices of the
church. For all other uses or advantages,
we are inclined to think that
many pupils who occupy a great
deal of time in gaining a very imperfect
smattering of Latin and Greek,
might better spare it for other studies.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>However the question may be
eventually settled in regard to the
classics as a part of general education,
it is certain that they must
retain their place in the education of
the clergy, and of at least a select
portion of those who are destined for
other learned pursuits and professions.
We shall speak more fully
about this part of the subject a little
further on. Before leaving the topic
of English education, however, we
have one or two supplementary observations
to make, suggested by the
remarks of other writers which we
have come across since we began
writing the present article.</p>

<p>F. Dalgairns, in an article which he
has published in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite>,
has expressed himself in a manner
quite similar to our own respecting
the necessity of a return to the
scholastic philosophy. His remarks
have given us great pleasure, and
they furnish one more proof of the
tendency toward unity in philosophical
doctrine among Catholics which
is daily spreading and gaining
strength. One observation of his
on this head is specially worthy of
attention. He says that it is necessary,
if we desire to teach the scholastic
philosophy to those who have received
or are receiving a modern or
English education, to translate and
explain its terms in the best and
most intelligible English. A mere
literal translation from Latin text-books
will not answer the purpose.
This is very true, and we cannot refrain
from expressing the wish that
the health and occupations of F. Dalgairns
may permit him to write an
entire series of philosophical essays,
like the one he has just published on
the <i>Soul</i>, to which we have just referred.
Indeed, we know of no one
better fitted by intellectual aptitude
for metaphysical reasoning and mastery
of the requisite art as a writer,
to prepare a manual of philosophy
for English students.</p>

<p>The <cite>Dublin Review</cite> has repeated
and sanctioned the observations of
F. Dalgairns, and has added something
to them equally worthy to be
noticed&mdash;to wit, that our Catholic
text-books of logic need to be improved
by incorporating into them
the results of the more careful and
thorough analysis of the laws of
logic which has been made by several
English writers. It is very true
that, although the English metaphysic
is a sorry affair, there have been
several very acute logicians among
modern English thinkers; as, for
instance, Mr. Mill, Mr. De Morgan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and Sir William Hamilton. We
suppose that the <cite>Dublin Review</cite>
intends to designate the doctrine of
what is technically called the "quantification
of the predicate" made
known by the two authors last mentioned,
simultaneously and independently
of each other, as a real
discovery in logical science, and an
addition to Aristotle's laws. We
hope the matter will be further discussed,
and that not only English and
American writers interested in the
subject of philosophical teaching
will give it their attention, but Continental
scholars also. For our own
part, our <i>rôle</i> at present is the modest
one of giving hints and provoking
discussion, and we therefore abstain
from going any deeper than a mere
scratch of the rich soil we hope to
see well dug and planted before
long.</p>

<p>From another and very different
quarter, we have found within a day
or two a corroboration of several
opinions we expressed in our first
article. Prof. Seeley, of the University
of Cambridge, England, in a
little volume of essays, noticed by us
in another place, advocates the teaching
of logic in English schools, dwells
on the importance of teaching history
after a better method, and sketches
out a plan of improving the instruction
given in medium schools and
universities, which is well worthy of
being read and thought over by those
who have the direction of education.</p>

<p>But we will turn now to another
and still higher department of education,
which embraces the courses of
study proper to the university and
the schools which are preparatory to
it. Beginning with that branch of
study which must undoubtedly still
continue to form an essential and
principal branch of the strictly collegiate
education, the classics, we do
not hesitate to say that this branch,
instead of being less, ought to be
more thoroughly and completely cultivated.
In so far as Latin is concerned,
it is evident that those who
aim at anything more than the degree
of knowledge requisite for
understanding better the modern
languages, and the terms which are
in common use derived from Latin,
or, perhaps, for a more intelligent appreciation
of church offices, ought to
master the language fully, together
with its classical literature. The
reasons which prove this statement
apply with tenfold force to ecclesiastics,
for whom Latin ought to be a
second mother-tongue. It is not
necessary to give these reasons, for
they are well known and fully appreciated
by all who are concerned with
the collegiate or ecclesiastical education
of Catholic youth.</p>

<p>The question of Greek is a distinct
one. For those who study the classics
for the sake of their intrinsic value
as works of art, Greek has the precedence
of Latin in importance. It
is evident, therefore, that a most
thorough and extensive course of
Greek is necessary for students of
this class. Whether such a course
ought to be made a part of the obligatory
collegiate curriculum of studies,
or merely provided for a select class
who may choose to enter upon it,
we leave to the discretion and judgment
of the learned. Undoubtedly,
we ought to have a certain number
of accomplished Grecians among our
men of letters. It is necessary in the
interests of ecclesiastical learning
that we should have thorough Greek
scholars among our clergy. For all
useful purposes, however, the value
of the amount of Greek actually
learned by the majority is exceedingly
small, and not to be compared
with the practical utility of a knowledge
of any one of several modern
languages, for example, the German.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
A clergyman, for instance,
who does not aspire to become a
learned philologist, but only to make
himself acquainted with the labors of
the best commentators on the Scripture,
will not find it very necessary
to be able to read the Septuagint or
the Greek New Testament. As for
Hebrew, whatever can be learned by
a short and superficial course will be
almost useless. If he desires to
read Aristotle, Plato, or the Greek
fathers, for the sake of their sense
and ideas, he can do so in the Latin
translations without any fear of being
led into any erroneous interpretation.
The point we are driving at is, that
the thorough study of Latin is the
most essential thing to be secured in
a <em>classical</em> course. Philosophy; a
moderate course of mathematics; the
English language and literature; the
physical sciences, and the modern
languages, especially the French, are
the other essentials of a complete
collegiate course. Whatever time
remains will be most usefully employed
in the study of history and of
modern political and social questions,
branches which are certainly essential
to a complete liberal education,
though for many, or perhaps most,
students their thorough cultivation
may have to be postponed until after
their college course is finished. The
improvement of the collegiate education
in all these branches, requires, of
course, a corresponding improvement
in the preparatory schools, since the
school and college depend on each
other. It is our opinion, in which
we are sure that the men most experienced
in these matters concur,
that those who begin their schooling
at the earliest suitable age need to be
well trained in an excellent preparatory
school until the age of seventeen,
before they are fit to profit fully by a
high collegiate course. Those who
begin later must enter college at a
more advanced age, unless they can
make up by diligence for lost time,
or be content with a shorter course
of study. The raising of the conditions
for entering college, which can
be done gradually, must improve the
preparatory schools, and the improvement
of these schools will in turn
benefit the colleges, by furnishing
them with subjects fitted for a higher
course of studies.</p>

<p>In saying this, we beg to disavow
any intention of undervaluing or
finding fault with the colleges and
schools at present existing, or the
learned and laborious corps of teachers
employed in them. They deserve
the highest meed of praise and
gratitude, and we may well congratulate
ourselves on the truly vast work
which has been accomplished, at
great cost and by dint of great efforts,
in the cause of Catholic education
in this country. But our motto
should ever be, like that of the past
generations of laborers in this great
cause, "Upward and onward!" We
trust, therefore, that all we may say
in favor of improvement will be
taken as an encouragement and not
as a fault-finding criticism&mdash;as a
friendly suggestion, and not as a presumptuous
attempt at dictation.</p>

<p>We have now reached the proper
place for speaking of the great necessity
of a Catholic University in the
United States. A well-conducted
college for undergraduates is not a
university, though it is often dignified
with that name; but is merely
one of the principal constituent parts
of a university. In regard to the
proper constitution, nature, and conduct
of a university, much has been
written, of late, both in Europe and
America. In Europe, those who
write on the subject either consider
the subject of improvement or reform
in universities already existing, or
the demands existing in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
quarters for the foundation of new
ones. These last are chiefly among
Catholics, who are extremely alive
to this necessity in several countries,
but especially in Germany and England.
The foundation of a great
Catholic University for Germany at
the spot which is most appropriate
for such a grand undertaking, on account
of its hallowed and scholastic
memories, Fulda, has been determined.
We hope that the efforts to
make the Catholic University of
Dublin completely successful, and to
found another in England, may
speedily produce their desired result.
In this country, the heads of the
older Protestant colleges are considering
what measures can be taken to
raise these institutions to the level of
the universities of Europe. Among
the papers which we have read from
different quarters on this subject,
those of Professor Seeley, of Cambridge,
and of one or two professors
of Yale College, writing in the <cite>New
Englander</cite>, have especially attracted
our attention; and we may have occasion
to reproduce some of their remarks
or suggestions in the present
article. Among the Catholics of the
United States, the Germans have
manifested what looks like the most
serious disposition which has yet
shown itself for taking the actual initiative
in the movement. We rejoice
to see it, and hope they may go on.
They are a most respectable body;
their energy, wealth, and power of
organized action are great. Germany
is full of young ecclesiastics of
the best education, who are sighing
for employment, and competent to
fill chairs in all the departments
except that of English literature.
We have but one precaution to
suggest, in case this enterprise is
undertaken, which is: that proper
care be taken to secure the
entire subordination of the corps of
governors and teachers to the hierarchy
and the Holy See, and to ascertain
the strict orthodoxy of the persons
called to fill the professorial chairs.
We want no followers of Hermes,
Döllinger, or any other leader of a
German sect in philosophy or theology;
and persons of that class
whose <i>rôle</i> is played out at home,
might be the very first to look out
for a new field in which to practise
their manœuvres, in a German University
in the United States, if they
saw a chance of securing in it the
desirable position of professors&mdash;a
position which has special attractions
for the German mind.</p>

<p>The <cite>Advocate</cite> of Louisville has recently
spoken out very strongly on
the need of a Catholic University in
this country; and the topic is frequently
broached in conversation, as,
indeed, it has been for the last fifteen
years. Let the Germans go forward
and take the lead if they are able and
willing; but this will not lessen the
necessity of the same action on the
part of the other Catholics of the
country, who, we may hope, will be
stimulated by the example of a body
of men so much smaller in number
than themselves. When the time
comes for action in this matter, the
direction of it will be in higher hands
than ours; but, meanwhile, we will
indulge ourselves in the at least
harmless amusement of sketching an
ideal plan of the university as it lies
in our own imagination, and of the
possible method of making it a
reality.</p>

<p>A university is a corporation of
learned and studious men who are
devoted to the acquisition and communication
of science and art in all
their higher branches. It may be
more or less complete and extensive.
In its greatest extension it ought to
comprise one or more colleges for
undergraduates, schools of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
special professional studies, and a
school of the higher and more profound
studies in every department of
literature and science. It must have
a permanent body of learned men
residing within its precincts, whose
lives are entirely devoted to study
and instruction. It must have a
vast library; museums of science and
antiquities; a gallery of painting,
sculpture, and all kinds of artistic
works; a complete scientific apparatus,
a botanical garden, magnificent
buildings, beautiful chapels, and a
grand collegiate church, with its
chapter of clergymen and perfectly
trained choir. It should have, also,
a great publishing-house, and issue
regularly its periodical reviews and
magazines, as well as books, of the
first class of excellence in the several
distinct departments of science and
letters. It must be richly endowed,
and well governed, under the supreme
control and direction of the
hierarchy and the Holy See. A
plan combining the chief distinctive
features of the Roman University,
Oxford, Louvain, and the best universities
of France and Germany,
with some improvements, would represent
the full and complete idea
we have in our mind.</p>

<p>When we come to the practical
question. What could be done now,
at once, toward the beginning of
such a colossal undertaking? it is
by no means so easy to solve it as it
is to sketch the plan of our ideal university.
We do not fancy, of course,
that such a grand institution as this
we have described, or even one similar
to the best existing European
universities, can be created in a
hurry by any speedy or summary
process. But if it is commenced
now, can it not be brought to completion
by the beginning of the
twentieth century? It seems to us
that in the year 1900 or 1925 we
shall need not one only, but three
grand Catholic universities in the
United States. That we can and
ought to begin the work of founding
one without delay, we have no
doubt. The difficulty is, however,
in pointing out a sensible and feasible
method of doing well what many
or most of us are ready to acknowledge
ought to be done quickly. Let
us suppose that the requisite authority
and the necessary funds are confided
to the hands of the proper
commission, who are to lay the first
stones in the foundation of a university.
How should they proceed, and
what should they first undertake?
As these high powers exist only potentially
and in our own imagination,
we can be certain that they will
not take offence if we presume to
offer them our opinion and advice.</p>

<p>What is the first and most obvious
want which we seek to satisfy by
founding a university? It is the
want of a collegiate system of education
and discipline superior to the
one already existing in our colleges,
and equal to any existing elsewhere.
The first thing to be done, then, is
to select some already existing college,
or to establish a new one, as
the nucleus of the future university.
We will suppose that some one of
our best colleges can be found which
has the requisite advantages of location,
etc., making it an eligible place
for a great university. Let measures
be taken to place the grade of education
and instruction in this college at
the highest mark. The first of these
measures must be to give it a corps
of professors and tutors fully equal to
their task, and to make the position
of these professors a dignified, honorable,
and permanent one. Another
measure of immediate necessity
would be the total separation of
the college from the grammar-school,
and the establishment of a system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
discipline suitable not for boys but
for young men. The mere announcement
by sufficiently high authority
that such a system would be
inaugurated in a college, would draw
at once within its walls students
enough eager to begin a thorough
course of study, to secure the success
of the experiment. At first, the
course of study already in vogue
might be carried on, merely adding
to it such branches as would not presuppose
a previous preparation not
actually possessed by the students.
For admission to the class of the
next year to come, the conditions
might be raised one grade higher,
and thus by successive changes, previously
made known, the maximum
standard might be reached without
inconvenience or injustice to any;
and the grammar-schools would be
enabled and obliged to prepare their
pupils expressly for the examination
they would have to pass for admittance
into the college. The college
thus properly planted and cultivated
would grow of itself in due time to
maturity and perfection. Nothing
more is wanted than a good system,
fit men to administer it, plenty of
money, and a body of youth fit and
desirous to be instructed and educated
in the best manner. The
library, the scientific cabinets, the
philosophical apparatus, the buildings,
grounds, and other exterior
means and appliances, should be
provided for as speedily and amply as
circumstances would permit.</p>

<p>The second great want, in our
opinion, is the provision for ecclesiastical
students of the advantages
for education which can
only be completely furnished by a
university, and which cannot, therefore,
be fully enjoyed at separate ecclesiastical
seminaries. The Little
Seminary is only a superior kind of
grammar-school, even though it gives
instruction in the ancient languages
and some other branches to the same
extent with a college. The Grand
Seminary is, strictly speaking, a college
for instruction in theology, although
it includes a year or two of
that study of philosophy which is only
introductory to the theological course.
A thorough university course, in
which all the instruction preparatory
to theology should be finished, would
give a more complete and thorough
education to young ecclesiastics, fit
them much better for their professional
studies, and prepare them
much more efficaciously for the high
position which belongs, by all divine
and human right, to the priesthood.
This is the way in which the clergy,
both secular and regular, were trained
during the Middle Ages. The system
of separate training came in afterward,
and has been kept up by a
sort of necessity, chiefly because the
universities have become so secularized
as to be dangerous places. We
have touched, in these last words, the
tender spot, which we well know
must be handled delicately. The
great argument for secluding young
ecclesiastics in seminaries entirely
separate from secular colleges is, that
their morals, their piety, their vocation,
are otherwise endangered. We
reply to this by a suggestion intended
to do away with the objection
to a university life, and at the
same time to show how its advantages
may be secured. Let both systems
be combined. Let there be a
college exclusively intended for
young ecclesiastics, in which they
shall be kept under the discipline of
the Little Seminary, at the university.
The Little Seminary will then take its
place as a separate grammar-school
for boys who are intended for the ecclesiastical
state. From this school
they can pass, not before their seventeenth
year, to the college at the university,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and they will have seven
years still remaining in which to
finish their education, before they arrive
at the canonical age for ordination
to the priesthood. It seems to
us that the separate college is a sufficient
security for the morals, piety,
and vocation of any young man
above seventeen years of age who is
fit to be a priest in this country outside
of the walls of a monastery.
Moreover, we are speaking about a
model Catholic university, which, we
should hope, would not be so extremely
dangerous a place for young
men. We have never heard that
Louvain is considered in that light
by the clergy of Belgium, and the
glimpse we had of a large body of
the Louvain students at Malines during
the session of the Congress of
1867, gave us the most favorable
impression of their virtuous character.</p>

<p>The university should also be the
seat of the principal Grand Seminary,
and of a school of Higher Theology.
The reasons for locating the place of
education for ecclesiastics at a university
apply to all the grades of
their distinct schools above that of
the grammar-school with nearly equal
force, and they are very weighty
in their nature. They concern in
part the professors and in part the
students. So far as the former are
concerned, it is evident that they
would derive the greatest advantage
from the facilities for study and intercourse
with learned men afforded by
the university, and would exercise the
most salutary influence over the professors
in the departments of philosophy
and secular science. One great
end of the university is to collect
together a great body of learned men
devoted to the pursuit of universal
science; and it is obvious that
this cannot be successfully accomplished
unless the ecclesiastical colleges
are included within the corporation.</p>

<p>In regard to the students, it seems
plain enough that all that part of
their course which precedes theology
can be much more thoroughly carried
on at a university of the highest class
than at a Little Seminary, especially if
these seminaries are numerous and
therefore necessarily limited in numbers
and all kinds of means for improvement.
A concentration of the
endowments, the instructors, and the
pupils in one grand institution, makes
it possible to give a much better and
higher kind of education, and saves a
great deal of labor besides. It is especially,
however, in relation to the
lectures on physical science, and the
cultivation of other general branches
distinct from the routine of class
recitations, that the university has the
advantage over the seminary. The
students of theology, moreover, can
receive great benefit from lectures of
this kind, and from the libraries, museums,
cabinets, etc., which a great
university will possess, as well as from
the greater ability and learning which
men chosen to fill the chairs of sacred
science in such an institution are
likely to have, in comparison with
those who can be made available for
giving instruction in many of the
smaller seminaries. Over and above
all these advantages for actually gaining
a greater amount of knowledge,
there is the immense advantage to be
gained of bringing up together and
binding into one intellectual brotherhood
our most highly educated
Catholic youth. There is something
in the atmosphere and the surroundings
of a great university which
quickens and enlarges the intellectual
life; brightens the faculties; trains
the mind for its future career, and
fits it to act in society and upon
men. The alma mater is a centre
of influences and associations lasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
through life. The learned men residing
there, and their pupils in all
professions, are bound together by
sacred ties, which are not only a
cause of pleasure to them in future
years, but of great power for good
in the community. Such a university
as we have described would in twenty-five
years produce a body of alumni
who would intellectually exert a
great influence over the Catholic
community throughout the United
States, and make themselves respected
by all classes of educated
men. The clergy ought to retain
the first place and a commanding
influence among this body of educated
Catholics. For this purpose, it
seems to us that they ought to be
educated with them, and look to
the same university as their alma
mater.</p>

<p>We see no reason, moreover, why
the religious orders and congregations
should not share and co-operate
in the labors and advantages of
this great enterprise. The smaller
congregations find the suitable education
of their postulants a difficult
task. One or more colleges at a
university, where these students could
reside by themselves, under their
own rule and superior, but receiving
their instruction from the university
professors, would solve this difficulty.
The older and more numerous religious
societies have greater facilities
for educating their students, and are
governed by their own old and peculiar
traditions. We will not presume
so far as to give them any suggestions
from our modern brain in regard
to matters in which they have
the experience of from one to six
centuries. It strikes us, however, as
a very pleasing and quite mediæval
idea, that our proposed grand university,
which we may as well make
as splendid as possible while it remains
purely ideal, should have its
Dominican, Jesuit, Sulpician, and
Lazarist colleges. There is no reason
why such colleges should not
make constituent parts of the university,
each one having its own laws
and regulating its own internal affairs
according to its own standards.</p>

<p>We will say nothing about the law,
medical, scientific, and artistic schools
which a university ought to have to
make it complete.</p>

<p>We have only attempted to show
how a university might be started on
its career. Once really alive and in
motion, the rest would be more easily
provided for. Undoubtedly, a
vast sum of money would be requisite
for such an undertaking. Our
wealthy Catholics would have to exercise
a princely liberality, and the whole
mass of the people would be obliged
to contribute generously for many
years in succession. We must admire
the remarkable instances of
princely liberality in the cause of general
education recently given by Mr.
Peabody, Mr. Cornell, and a considerable
number of other wealthy
gentlemen in the United States, whose
benefactions to colleges and schools
have been frequent and munificent.
Let us have one-twentieth part of
the money expended on education
by other religious or learned societies,
and we will show again
what we did in former ages, when
we founded Oxford, Cambridge, St.
Gall, Bec, Paris, Salamanca, Fulda,
Louvain, Cologne, Pavia, Padua, Bologna,
and the other famous schools
of the middle ages. What more important
or more glorious work can
be proposed to the Catholics of the
United States than this? We know
what our Catholic youth are, for we
have spent much time in giving them
both scholastic and religious instruction.
What can be more ingenuous,
bright, and promising than their character&mdash;more
capable of being moulded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and formed to everything that is
virtuous and noble? They contain
the material which only needs the
proper formation to produce a new
and better age, which we fervently
hope is already beginning to dawn.
As the Alcuins, Lanfrancs, and other
illustrious fathers of education in
former times were among the principal
agents in producing epochs of
new life, so those who take up their
work now in our own country, and
throughout Christendom, will be
among the principal benefactors of
the church and the human race, and
deserve for themselves a most honorable
crown.</p>

<p>Our topic in the present article has
led us to present almost exclusively
and in strong light the advantages to
be derived from a university and from
university education, in relation both
to the ecclesiastical state and secular
professions. To prevent mistake, we
add in conclusion, that we do not
desire or anticipate the suppression
or merging into one institution of all
our colleges and seminaries. It is
scarcely possible that all the students
of this vast country should be educated
in one place. The necessity
for other colleges and seminaries will
of itself create or continue them.
The university will give them an example
and model to follow, will furnish
those not already amply provided
for from the bosom of old and
learned religious orders with professors,
will give those who desire it a
chance to complete their studies after
leaving college by residing for a
time within its walls, and will reign
as a queen among lesser institutions,
giving tone, character, and uniformity
to the scientific and literary community
of Catholic scholars throughout
the country. There are doubtless certain
respects in which the universities
of Europe must always have an
advantage over any institution we
can hope to found in this new country.
Some, or even many, will always
have a longing for a residence
abroad in these ancient seats of learning,
which they may and ought to
gratify, when it lies in their power to
do so. Above all other places, Rome
must ever draw to her those who desire
to drink faith, piety, and knowledge
from their fountain-head. And,
if a better age is really coming, not
only will the Pope necessarily be secured
in a more tranquil and firm possession
of his temporal kingdom in all
the extent which he justly claims,
that he may govern the church with
all the plenitude of his supremacy,
but also that the wealth and prosperity
of the Roman Church may give to
her institutions of learning an amplitude
and splendor which they have
never yet attained. Planets are
nevertheless necessary as well as a
sun in a system, and so also are satellites.
However ample and extensive
the provisions made at Rome may
be for educating a select portion of
the clergy of all countries, they can
never make it unnecessary to provide
also in every country for the best
and highest education of its own clergy.
So far as we can see, every reason
and consideration cries out imperatively
for the speedy foundation
of a Catholic University in the United
States.</p>

<h2>WRITING MATERIALS OF THE ANCIENTS.</h2>


<p>It is curious to remark the various
and apparently incongruous substances
which men, in their efforts to preserve
knowledge or transmit ideas,
have used as writing materials. The
animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms
have each and all been laid
under contribution. In every land
and in every age, stone and marble
have been employed to perpetuate
the remembrance of the great deeds
of history. Inscriptions cut in jasper,
cornelian, and agate are to be
met with in every collection of antiquities.
A cone of basalt covered
with cuneiform characters was found
some years since in the river Euphrates,
and is now preserved in the Imperial
Library of Paris, side by side
with the sun-baked bricks on which
the Babylonian astronomers were
wont during seven centuries to inscribe
their observations on the starry
heavens.</p>

<p>The Romans made books of bronze,
in which they engraved the concessions
granted to their colonies; and
they preserved on tablets and pillars
of the same durable material the decrees
and treaties of the senate, and
sometimes, even, the speeches of their
emperors.</p>

<p>"The Bœotians," says the learned
Greek geographer Pausanias, "showed
me a roll of lead on which was
inscribed the whole work of Hesiod,
but in characters that time had nearly
effaced."</p>

<p>"Who will grant me," cries Job,
"that my words may be written?
who will grant me that they may be
marked down in a book? With an
iron pen and in a plate of lead, or
else be graven with an instrument in
flintstone?" (xix. 23 24.)</p>

<p>Tanned skins were likewise employed
for writing purposes by the
Asiatics, the Greeks, the Romans,
and the Celts. In the Brussels library
there is to be seen a manuscript
of the Pentateuch, believed to
be anterior to the ninth century, written
on fifty-seven skins sewed together,
and forming a roll more than
thirty-six yards long.</p>

<p>The custom of writing on leathern
garments appears to have been prevalent
during the middle ages. The
great Italian poet, Petrarch, used to
wear a leathern vest, on which, while
sitting or sauntering near the shaded
margin of the fountain of Vaucluse,
he would note each passing thought,
each poetic fancy. This precious relic,
covered with erasures, still existed
in 1527.</p>

<p>We read, too, of a certain abbot
who strictly enjoined his monks, if
they happened to meet with any of
the works of St. Athanasius, to transcribe
the precious volumes on their
clothes, should paper be unattainable.</p>

<p>The use of prepared sheep-skin,
that is, parchment, dates from about
a hundred and fifty years before the
Christian era; its Latin name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pergamena</i>,
is very evidently derived from
Pergamos, but whether because invented
there, or because it was more
perfectly prepared in that city than
elsewhere, is a question not yet decided.
Besides white and yellow
parchment, the ancients employed
purple, blue, and violet. These dark
shades were intended to be written
on with gold and silver ink. Several
very beautiful manuscripts of this description
are to be seen in the Imperial
Library of Paris. Parchment
manuscripts were sometimes of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
size; thus, the roll containing the inquiry
concerning the Knights Templars,
which is still preserved in the
archives of France, is full twenty-three
yards long.</p>

<p>Parchment became very scarce
during the invasions of the barbarians,
and this scarcity gave rise to the
custom of effacing the characters of
ancient manuscripts in order to write
a second time on the skin. This unfortunate
practice, most prevalent
among the Romans, and which was
continued until the invention of rag
paper, has occasioned the loss of
many literary and scientific treasures.
The primitive characters of some few
of these doubly-written manuscripts,
or palimpsests, as they are called,
have been restored by chemical science,
and several valuable works recovered;
among others, for instance,
Cicero's admirable treatise on the Republic.</p>

<p>Even the intestines of animals
have been used as writing material.
The magnificent library of Constantinople,
burnt under the Emperor of
the East, Basiliscus, is said to have
contained, among its other curiosities,
the Iliad and the Odyssey, traced in
letters of gold on the intestine of a
serpent. This rare specimen of caligraphy
measured one hundred and
twenty feet.</p>

<p>The most ancient inscribed characters
we possess are upon wood.
A sycamore tablet containing an engraved
inscription was discovered,
about thirty years since, in one of
the Memphis pyramids; the learned
Egyptologist who deciphered it pronounced
it to have been in existence
some five thousand nine hundred
years! The Chinese, also, before
they invented paper two thousand
years ago, wrote upon wood and
bamboo. Many oriental nations still
make books of palm-leaves, on which
the characters are scratched with a
sharp-pointed instrument. The Syracusans
of bygone times used to
write their votes on an olive-leaf.
The modern Maldivians trace their
hopes, fears, and wishes on the gigantic
foliage of their favorite tree,
the makareko, of which each leaf is
a yard long and half a yard wide.
The Imperial Library of Paris, rich
in all that is rare and interesting,
possesses several ancient leaf manuscripts,
some beautifully varnished
and gilt.</p>

<p>In Rome, before the use of bronze
tables and columns, the laws were
engraven on oak boards. "The annals
of the pagan high-priests," says
a French writer, "which related day
by day the principal events of the
year, were probably written with
black ink on an <i>album</i>, that is, a
wooden plank whitened with white-lead.
These annals ceased a hundred
and twenty years before Christ,
but the use of the <i>album</i> was kept
up some time longer." The Romans
also wrote their wills on wood.</p>

<p>Linen cloth covered with writing
has been found in most of the mummy-cases
that have been opened. The
Egyptian Museum in the Louvre contains
several rituals on cloth. The
Sibylline Oracles were traced on
cloth. The first copy of the Emperor
Aurelian's journal that was made
after his death was written on cloth,
and is still preserved in the Library
of the Vatican. On cloth were written
also some of the edicts of the
first Christian emperors.</p>

<p>No certain epoch can be ascribed
to the fabrication of paper from the
papyrus reed. The celebrated French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i>, Champollion the younger, discovered
during his travels in Egypt
several contracts written on papyrus,
which by their date must have been
drawn up seventeen hundred years
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Egypt appears to have kept the monopoly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the papyrus paper trade.
The principal manufactories of it
were situated at Alexandria, and so
important an article of commerce did
it become that a dearth of papyrus
was the cause of several popular disturbances
in some of the great cities
of Italy and Greece. Under the
Emperor Tiberius, a scarcity in the
supply produced so formidable a riot
in Rome, that the senate was compelled
to take measures similar to
those necessary in years of famine,
and actually had to name commissaries,
whose duty it was to distribute
to each citizen the quantity of writing-paper
he absolutely required.</p>

<p>The papyrus reed seems indeed to
have been ancient Egypt's greatest
material blessing, for not only was it
the principal article of foreign commerce
and source of immense wealth
in the form of paper, but it was also
of the most extraordinary utility to
the poorer classes. Household utensils
of every description were fabricated
from its roots; boats were constructed
of its stem; roofing, sail-cloth,
ropes, and clothes were made of its
bark; and from the appellation of "eaters
of papyrus," often applied to the
Egyptians by the Greeks, some have
thought that it was a common article
of food. How extraordinary does it
then seem that a plant of such inestimable
value should ever have disappeared
from a land which derived
such benefits from it. Nevertheless,
it is a singular fact that the papyrus
is no longer to be found in Egypt;
recent travellers assure us that not a
stalk is to be seen at the present day
in the Delta. Sicily alone now possesses
the beautiful reed.</p>

<p>We are ignorant of the exact period
of the introduction of the papyrus
paper into Greece and Italy, but
Pliny has left us copious details concerning
the manipulations it underwent
among the Romans. Sizing
was then, as it is now, one of the most
important operations in paper-making.
The membranous covering of
the stem of the papyrus reed was far
from being of a firm, compact texture,
and the Alexandrian factories
probably sent it forth very imperfectly
prepared. The best quality of
paper was made by gluing together,
with starch and vinegar, two sheets
of papyrus, one transversely to the
other, and then sizing them. These
sheets were sometimes of considerable
dimensions; documents have been
discovered written on paper three
yards in length.</p>

<p>Those true lovers of literature, art,
and science, the Athenians, raised a
statue to Philtatius&mdash;to him who first
taught them the secret of sizing paper!</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that, about thirty
years since, the vegetable size used
by the ancient Egyptians was introduced,
with some slight improvement,
as a new discovery, into the paper
manufactories of France, and has
now almost entirely abolished the use
of animal size in that country for all
purposes connected with the fabrication
of paper.</p>

<p>About the fourth century, the Arabs
made Europe acquainted with cotton
paper, just then invented in Damascus,
thereby causing a great diminution
in the papyrus trade. A long
struggle ensued between the rival
productions, which was only put an
end to at the commencement of the
twelfth century, by the invention of
paper manufactured from flaxen and
hempen refuse. The papyrus disappeared
at once and completely; soon
forgotten by commerce, but immortal
in the remembrance of poets and
sages&mdash;immortal as the pages of Cicero
and Virgil, whose sweet and
eloquent thoughts were first traced
on Egypt's reed.</p>

<p>Until the present time, this flaxen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and hempen rag paper has been produced
in sufficient quantities for the
necessities of our civilization, but as
civilization increases, and as education
becomes more general, especially
among the masses of Europe, it is
evident that the supply of rags will
be inadequate to the demand, and
wood will most probably again be
brought into requisition, as in the
age of Pericles.</p>

<p>Not, however, in the form of the
ancient tablets, but transformed by
mechanical and chemical science into
sheets of white and pliant paper;
or the numerous fibrous plants of
Algeria, Cuba, and other tropical
countries will be turned to account,
and no longer permitted to waste
their usefulness on the desert air.
Even now, in France, among the
Vosges Mountains, there is a paper
manufactory where wood is manipulated
with the most complete
success. And some few years since,
a newspaper paragraph informed the
civilized world that a process of making
paper from marble had been discovered
by a canny Scotchman of
Glasgow! It is not, indeed, impossible
that the marble painfully hewn
and engraven by our forefathers to
perpetuate the memory of a bloody
struggle or of some vain triumph,
may in time to come, by the magic
power of modern science, become a
sheet of snowy tissue, whereon the
fair, slight hand of beauty shall trace
the dainty nothings of fashionable
life!</p>

<p>The tablets so continually mentioned
by ancient writers must be
noted. They were made of parchment,
thin boards, ivory, or metal,
prepared to receive ink, or coated
with wax and written on with a stylus,
or sharp-pointed pencil. In the
Fourth Book of Kings we read: "I
will efface Jerusalem as tables are
wont to be effaced, and I will erase
and turn it, and draw the pencil over
the face thereof." Herodotus and
Demosthenes speak of their tablets.
In Rome, they were used not only
as note-books and journals, but also
for correspondence in the city and
its environs, while the papyrus served
for letters intended to be sent to a
distance. The receiver of one of
these notes not unfrequently returned
his answer on the same tablet.
Made of African cypress and highly
ornamented and inlaid, they were given
as presents, precisely as portfolios,
souvenirs, and note-books are nowadays.
On the wax-covered tablets
was generally traced the first rough
copy of any document, to be afterward
neatly written out either on
papyrus or parchment. These wax-covered
tablets were used in France
until the beginning of the last century.</p>

<p>Two-leaved tablets were called
diptychs, and were sometimes of extraordinary
cost and beauty. The
Roman consuls and high magistrates
were accustomed, on their first appointment
to office, to present their
friends with ivory diptychs, exquisitely
engraved and carved, and ornamented
with gold.</p>

<p>Ancient ink was composed of lamp-black
and gum-water. Pliny says
that the addition of a little vinegar
rendered it ineffaceable, and that a
little wormwood infused in it preserved
the manuscript from mice.
This ink was used until the twelfth
century, when our present common
ink was invented.</p>

<p>Not only black, but also red, blue,
green, and yellow inks were employed
in antiquity. Sepia ink and Indian
ink are mentioned by Pliny.
Red ink, made from a murex, was especially
esteemed, and reserved for
the emperor's exclusive use, under
pain of death to all infringers of the
privilege. Gold and silver inks, principally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
used from the eighth to the
tenth centuries, were also prized;
writers in gold, termed chrysographers,
formed a class apart among writers
in general. The Imperial Library
of Paris possesses several Greek Gospels,
and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Livre des Heures</i> of
Charles the Bold, entirely written in
gold. Few manuscripts are extant
written in silver; the most celebrated
are the Gospels, preserved in the
Upsal Library.</p>

<p>The stylus, a dangerous weapon
when made in iron, and proscribed
by Roman law, which required it to
be of bone; the painting brush, used
still by the Chinese; the reed, which
was cut and shaped like our modern
pen, and with which some oriental
nations write even now; and the
feather pen, which is mentioned by
an anonymous writer of the fifth century,
were the general writing implements
of antiquity and the middle
ages. Metallic pens are also supposed
to have been known; the Patriarchs
of Constantinople were accustomed
to sign their official acts with
a silver reed, probably of the form
of a pen.</p>

<p>Some paintings found in Herculaneum
give evidence that the ancients
were accustomed to make use
of most, if not of all the various conveniences
with which modern writers
surround themselves. The writing-desk,
the inkstand, the penknife,
the eraser, the hone, and the powder-box
were well-known. They do not
seem, however, to have had the habit
of sitting up to a table to write,
but rested their tablet or paper on
their knee, or on their left hand, as
the orientals do at the present day.</p>

<h2>DOÑA FORTUNA AND DON DINERO.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE SPANISH OF FERNAN CABALLERO.</p>


<p>Well, sirs, Doña Fortuna and
Don Dinero were so in love that you
never saw one without the other.
The bucket follows the rope, and
Don Dinero followed Doña Fortuna
till folks began to talk scandal. Then
they made up their minds to get
married.</p>

<p>Don Dinero was a big swollen fellow,
with a head of Peruvian gold, a
belly of Mexican silver, legs of the
copper of Segovia, and shoes of paper
from the great factory of Madrid.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Doña Fortuna was a mad-cap,
without faith or law, very slippery, uncertain,
and queer, and blinder than
a mole.</p>

<p>The pair were at cross purposes before
they had finished the wedding-cake.
The woman wanted to take
the command, but this did not suit
Don Dinero, who was of an overbearing
and haughty disposition. Why,
sirs! my father (may glory be his
rest!) used to say that if the sea were
to get married he would lose his
fierceness. But Don Dinero was
more proud than the sea and did
not lose his presumption.</p>

<p>As both wished to be first and
best, and neither would consent to
be last or least, they determined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>decide by a trial which of the two
had the more power.</p>

<p>"Look," said the wife to the husband,
"do you see, down there in the
hollow of that olive-tree, that poor man
so discouraged and chop-fallen? Let's
try whether you or I can do more for
him."</p>

<p>The husband agreed, and they
went right away, he croaking, and
she with a jump, and took up their
quarters by the tree.</p>

<p>The man, who was a wretch that
had never in his whole life seen either
of them, opened eyes like a pair
of great olives when the two appeared
suddenly in front of him.</p>

<p>"God be with you!" said Don
Dinero.</p>

<p>"And with his grace's worship
also," replied the poor man.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"I only know his highness to
serve him."</p>

<p>"You have never seen my
face?"</p>

<p>"Never since God made me."</p>

<p>"How is that&mdash;have you nothing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I have six children as
naked as colts, with throats like old
stocking-legs; but, as to property, I
have only <i>grab and swallow</i>, and often
not that."</p>

<p>"Why don't you work?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because I can't find
work, and I'm so unlucky that everything
I undertake turns out as crooked
as a goat's horn. Since I married,
it appears as though a frost had
fallen on me. I'm the fag of ill-hap.
Now, here&mdash;a master set us to dig
him a well for a price, promising
doubloons when it should be finished,
but giving not a single <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">maravedi</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
beforehand."</p>

<p>"The master was wise," remarked
Don Dinero. "'Money taken, arms
broken,' is a good saying. Go on, my
man."</p>

<p>"I put my soul in the work; for,
notwithstanding your worship sees
me looking so forlorn, I am a man,
sir."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Don Dinero, "I had
perceived that."</p>

<p>"But there are four kinds of men,
señor. There are men that are men;
there are good-for-naughts; and contemptible
monkeys; and men that
are below monkeys, and not worth
the water they drink. But, as I was
telling you, the deeper we dug, the
lower down we went, but the fewer
signs we found of water. It appeared
as if the centre of the world had
been dried. Lastly, and finally, we
found nothing, señor, but a cobbler."</p>

<p>"In the bowels of the earth!" exclaimed
Don Dinero, indignant at
hearing that his ancestral palace was
so meanly inhabited.</p>

<p>"No, señor!" said the man deprecatingly;
"not in the bowels; further
on, in the country of the other
tribe."</p>

<p>"What tribe, man?"</p>

<p>"The antipodes, señor."</p>

<p>"My friend, I am going to do you
a favor," said Don Dinero pompously;
and he put a dollar in the man's
hand.</p>

<p>The man hardly credited his eyes;
joy lent wings to his feet, he was not
long in arriving at a baker's shop
and buying bread, but, when he went
to take out his money, he found nothing
in his pocket but the hole
through which his dollar had gone
without saying good-by.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was in despair; he
looked for it, but when did one of
his sort ever find anything? No;
St. Anthony guards the pig that is
destined for the wolf. After the money
he lost time, and after time patience,
and, that lost, he fell to casting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
after his bad luck every curse
that ever opened lips.</p>

<p>Doña Fortuna strained herself with
laughing. Don Dinero's face turned
yellower with bile, but he had no remedy
except to put his hand in his
pocket and bring out an <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">onza</i><a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> to
give the man.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was so full of joy
that it leaped out of his eyes. He
did not go for bread this time,
but hurried to a dry-goods store to
buy a few clothes for his wife and
children. When he handed the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">onza</i>
to pay for what he had bought, the
dealer said, and stuck to it, that the
piece was bad; that no doubt its
owner was a coiner of false money,
and that he was going to give him
up to justice. On hearing this, the
poor man was confounded, and his
face became so hot that you might
have toasted beans on it; but he
took to his heels and ran to tell Don
Dinero what had happened, weeping
the while with shame and disappointment.</p>

<p>Doña Fortuna nearly burst herself
with laughing, and Don Dinero felt
the mustard rising in his nose.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
"Here," said he to the poor man,
"take these two thousand reals; your
luck is truly bad; but if I don't mend
it, my power is less than I
think."</p>

<p>The man set off so delighted that
he saw nothing until he flattened his
nose against some robbers. They
left him as his mother brought him
into the world.</p>

<p>When his wife chucked him under
the chin and said it was her turn, and
it would soon be seen which had the
more power, the petticoats or the
breeches, Don Dinero looked more
shame-faced than a clown.</p>

<p>She then went to the poor man,
who had thrown himself on the
ground and was tearing his hair, and
blew on him. At the instant the lost
dollar lay under his hand. "Something
is something," he said to himself;
"I'll buy bread for my children,
for they have gone three days
on half a ration, and their stomachs
must be as empty as a charity-box."</p>

<p>As he passed before the shop
where he had bought the clothes, the
dealer called him in, and begged of
him to overlook his previous rudeness;
said that he had really believed
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">onza</i> to be a bad one, but
that the assayer, who happened to
stop as he passed that way, had assured
him that it was one of the very
best, rather over than under weight,
in fact. He asked leave to return
the piece, and the clothes besides,
which he begged him to accept as an
expression of sorrow for the annoyance
he had caused him.</p>

<p>The poor man declared himself
satisfied, loaded his arms with the
things; and, if you will believe me, as
he was crossing the plaza, some soldiers
of the civil guard were bringing
in the highwaymen that had robbed
him. Immediately, the judge, who
was one of the judges God sends,
made them restore the two thousand
reals without costs or waste. The
poor man, in partnership with a
neighbor of his, put his money in a
mine. Before they had dug down
six feet they struck a vein of gold,
another of lead, and another of iron.
Right away people began to call him
Don, then "You Sir," then Your Excellency.
Since that time Doña Fortuna
has had her husband humbled
and shut up in her shoe, and she,
more addle-pated and indiscriminating
than ever, goes on distributing
her favors without rhyme or reason,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
without judgment or discretion&mdash;madly,
foolishly, generously, hit or
miss, like the blows of the blind
stick; and one of them will reach the
writer, if the reader is pleased with
the tale.</p>

<h2>LETTER FROM ROME.</h2>


<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Rome</span>, Jan. 21, 1871.</p>


<p>Four months have gone by since
the Italian troops entered Rome
through the breach made by the
cannon of Cadorna, four months
since a new light dawned upon
the Eternal City, and its regenerators
set about the accomplishment
of their aspirations. What
has been the development of this
third life of Rome&mdash;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">la terza vita</i>, as
Terenzio Mamiani has been pleased
to style it&mdash;in this its primal stage?
The child is father to the man&mdash;the
seed produces the tree and its fruit.
So, too, do the beginnings of a political
state give an index of its future,
fix the causes that are to produce
the results of the future. The history
of these four months, then, must
be looked on with interest, and pondered
with care.</p>

<p>The present century is universally
considered an age of progress, and it
was in the name of progress that the
forces of Victor Emmanuel entered
the capital of Christianity. Progress
implies motion from one state or
condition to another more perfect:
the simplicity of this statement cannot
be gainsaid, and we shall assume
it as uncontested. The party of
progress took possession of Rome
in the interest of progress. Has
Rome progressed during these
months since the 20th of September?
Has she gone from her past state to
one more perfect? Facts must
speak; and facts we give. One thing
at a time.</p>

<p>Abundance and cheapness of food
are the first essentials in the well-being
of a state, and necessarily connected
with this is the facility of obtaining
it. We cannot say that food
is scarce in Rome; but the absolute
and the relative cheapness have undergone
a decided change, to the disadvantage
of the poorer as well as
the wealthier classes, since the 20th
of September. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mocinato</i>, or so-called
grist-tax, extending even to
the grinding of dried vegetables,
chestnuts, and acorns, has sent up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the price of bread. Salt has risen at
least a cent per pound. The further
application of the system of heavy
taxation is not likely to make other
articles of prime necessity cheaper.
And while this state of things exists,
the facility of obtaining food has
become much less for the poorer
classes. The causes of this are to
be sought in the want of employers.
It is the universal complaint that
there is no work. Before the coming
of the present rulers, the army
of the Pope, composed in great part
of young men of some means, spent
a great deal among the people. This
source of gain ceased with the disbandment
of the Papal troops, for it
is notorious <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lippis et tonsoribus</i>, that
the men of the present contingent
have barely enough daily allowance
to keep body and soul together. Besides
this, ecclesiastics spent their
revenues, fixed by law and sure, with
a liberal hand. Now, when they find
difficulty in getting even what they
cannot be deprived of; now that
confiscation hangs over their heads
with menacing aspect; now that religious
orders are called on to make
immense outlays to send their young
men to places of safety&mdash;in one case to
the extent of six thousand dollars&mdash;it
would be foolish to expect them to
sacrifice what is necessary for themselves;
though, to do them justice,
they are always willing to share their
little with the poor. Dearth of foreign
ecclesiastics, and of foreigners
in general, is another source of distress,
and this is directly a consequence
of the invasion. The result
of all this is that there is more misery
in the city of Rome than has
been seen for many a day&mdash;beggars
are more numerous in the streets,
and needy families, ashamed to beg,
suffer in silence or pour their tale
of woe into the ear of the clergy,
who always are honored with the
confidence of the poor and afflicted.
Surely this state of things is not an
improvement on the plenty which
characterized the rule of the pontiffs.
We cannot say Rome in this
respect has moved into a better
sphere&mdash;that she has progressed.</p>

<p>Security of person and property is
another essential object of the attention
of every state. No state
that cannot guarantee this is deserving
of the name of having a good
government. Under the Papal rule,
it is well known that not only in
Rome did good order prevail, as the
immense multitude present at the
Œcumenical Council can attest, but
that also on the frontiers of the territories
governed by the Pope, after
the withdrawal of the French
troops from Veroli and Anagni, the
energy displayed by the Roman delegate
was such as to liberate completely
the provinces from the bands
sprung from the civil strifes of
southern Italy. The city of Rome
itself was a model of good order and
of personal safety. Now things are
changed. Only a few days ago, a
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">guardia di pubblica sicurezza</span>" was
stopped in the streets and robbed
of his watch and <i>revolver</i>. There is
not a day that has not in the daily
papers its record of thefts and acts
of personal violence. Only a few
days ago, there was a sacrilegious
robbery in the Church of St. Andrea
della Valle. On the 8th of December
there was rioting with bloodshed
in Rome. A band of young students
under the charge of a religious
were stoned on Sunday, January
15. On the 16th, the Very Rev.
Rector of the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ospizio degli Orfanelli</span>"
was struck with a stone. It
would be easy to multiply examples,
but those we have given are quite
enough to show that progress in security
of person and property has
not been attained since the 20th
of September, 1870.</p>

<p>Then public morality in the centre
of Christianity could not fail to be
at a far higher standard, now that the
regeneration of the city of Rome has
been accomplished. What bitter illusions
fortune delights in dispensing
to those that trust her! Before
the entrance of Italian statesmen into
Rome, vice and immorality did not
dare raise their heads&mdash;they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
not flaunt themselves on the public
ways. Now there is a change, and
the moral order of Italy has entered
through the breach at the Porta
Pia. We say no more, the subject is
a delicate one, and we therefore refrain
from penning facts notorious
in Rome. Surely, none who has received
even an elementary training
in virtue will deem this state of
things progress&mdash;an elevation to a
higher and more perfect state.</p>

<p>But the King of Italy came to
Rome to protect the independence
of the Sovereign Pontiff, to save
him from the bondage of foreign
hordes. Now, as the Pope is principally
a spiritual sovereign, it is his
spiritual power that most needs protection;
consequently, the King of
Italy and his faithful servants have
been most zealous in preventing
acts or publications that would tend
to diminish the respect due to the
Holy Father.</p>

<p>Incomprehensible, but true&mdash;the
very opposite has taken place!
We have at hand the satirical paper,
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Don Pirlone Figlio</i>, of January
19. On its first page is a ridiculous
adaptation of the heading used
by the cardinal vicar in his official
notifications to the faithful. The
same page has an article grossly disrespectful
to the Sovereign Pontiff,
and insulting to the Belgian deputation,
who have just come on to
present the protest of their countrymen,
and their contributions.
The Holy Father is styled <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giovanni
Mastai detto Colui ex-disponibile
anche lui</span>; the members of the deputation
are given ridiculous names;
and the contributors of Peter Pence
are blackbirds caught in a cage; finally,
a ridiculous discourse is put in the
mouth of the Pope, concluding with
a benediction. The illustration represents
Pius IX. with a boot in his
hand, in the act of giving it to the
Emperor of Germany, who figures as
a cobbler. Such are the illustrations
and articles one sees exposed to the
public day by day. When we who
have seen Rome under far different
circumstances witness these things,
is it at all strange that we refuse to
see "the general respect shown to
ecclesiastics in the exercise of their
sacred functions," even though on
the faith of a Lamarmora it be asserted
to exist? Can we be blamed
for thinking that anything but progress
in veneration of religion has
been the result of the taking of
Rome?</p>

<p>After this, any of the advantages
arising from the occupation of Rome
can have no weight sufficient to warrant
much attention&mdash;for they must
be, as they are, material and of a low
order&mdash;chiefly regarding facility of
communication and despatch in business
matters, things desirable in
themselves, but, it would seem, purchased
at a fearful sacrifice.</p>

<p>Is this state of things to continue?
Is the Italian kingdom on such a
permanent basis that the Papacy has
no hope of a change that may give
it back its possessions? Or can the
kingdom of Italy be brought to
make restitution of what it has
seized, without itself undergoing
destruction? A word in reply to
each of these queries. And first,
is this state of things to continue?</p>

<p>When we consider who the Sovereign
Pontiff is, and consult the opinions
of men famed for their foresight
and statesmanship, it is difficult
to deny that the restoration of
the Pontiff to his rights is very possible.
Napoleon Bonaparte, although
he afterwards made Pius VII. his
prisoner, left recorded his opinion
that it was impossible that the Pope
should be the subject of any one
sovereign, and that it was providential
the head of the church had been
given the possession of a small state
to secure his independence. M.
Thiers, in commendation of whom we
need say nothing, as his reputation is
world-wide, has clearly and forcibly
proclaimed this very opinion. In
the debates on the temporal power
in the French Senate, in 1867, his
voice was heard calling on France
to protect Rome, and it was his
energy forced from the hypocritical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
government of his country the
famous word, uttered by Rouher,
that struck terror into Italy&mdash;"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jamais</i>."
One would imagine that
now Rome has fallen, and France is
reduced to the verge of desperation,
no man of "liberal" political views
would be foolhardy enough to risk
his reputation by reiterating an opinion
like this. Yet, strange to say,
there is one who has been willing to
run the risk, and that in the very
Chamber of Deputies at Florence.
Only a few weeks ago, the Deputy
Toscanelli, a liberal, and, we learn,
a free-thinker, with a courage, a
strength of argument, and flow of
wit that gained the respect and attention
of the house, almost in the words
of M. Thiers gave the same opinion.
In the days of the last of the Medici,
said the distinguished deputy, there
was a court-jester riding a spirited
horse down the Via Calzaioli, in Florence.
The horse got the better of
his rider, and started off at full speed.
"Ho! Sor Fagioli," cried out one
of the crowd, "where are you going
to fall?" "No one knows or can
know," was the jester's answer, as
he held on with both hands. Just
so is it with the government; it has
mounted a policy that is running
away with it, and neither it nor any
one else knows where it is going to
fall. The government has gone to
Rome, and in Rome it cannot stay;
it cannot hold its own face to face
with the Pope. "I give you, then,
this advice: leave Rome, declare it
a free city under the protection of
the kingdom of Italy." So much for
the opinions of political men of eminence;
we will examine the question
for a moment on its intrinsic
merits.</p>

<p>We know the Sovereign Pontiff in
his official capacity of teacher of the
whole church is infallible in declarations
regarding faith or morals. But
in other matters of policy, of fact,
he has no guarantee against error
beyond what is afforded him by
the use of the means which he
has at hand, the information of
his advisers, and especially of the
Sacred College of Cardinals. Suppose
for a moment this means of
information is done away with, or
made a vehicle of untrue statements.
Suppose unworthy men are artfully
intruded on the Pope, and act in accordance
with instructions received
from the rulers of Italy. Imagine
Italy at war or on bad terms with
the United States or England. A
crafty statesman sees an opportunity
of putting in a position to aid him
in one or the other country an able
man, through the influence of some
high ecclesiastic, whose good opinion
will have great weight with
men of standing or with the people.
The whole matter is artfully carried
out. There is an understanding between
the Italian statesman and his
American or English friend; both
act cautiously and avoid alarming
susceptibilities. The affair works
well. Persons around the Pope are
made to drop a word incidentally in
praise of the virtue and ability of
the one whom it is intended to raise
to power. The Pope in his relations
with the bishops of foreign countries,
speaking of the prospects of
the church in good faith, speaks also
to the ecclesiastic of whom we have
made mention, and in favorable
terms, of the person in question.
Who that knows human nature can
fail to see the thorough nature of
the influence thus used? The crafty
originators are the ones to blame,
and the harm done is effected in perfect
good faith by the unconscious
instruments of their design. To
show we are not building on our fancy,
we turn to the pages of a man
whose name all revere&mdash;Cardinal
Wiseman. In his <cite>Recollections of the
Last Four Popes</cite>, he speaks of the
character of Pius VII.:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When no longer a monarch, but a
captive&mdash;when bereft of all advice and
sympathy, but pressed on close by those
who, themselves probably deceived, thoroughly
deceived him, he committed the
one error of his life and pontificate, in
1813. For there came to him men 'of the
seed of Aaron,' who could not be expected
to mislead him, themselves free and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
moving in the busiest of the world, who
showed him, through the loopholes of his
prison, that world from which he was
shut out, as though agitated on its surface,
and to its lowest depths, through
his unbendingness; the church torn to
schism, and religion weakened to destruction,
from what they termed his
obstinacy. He who had but prayed and
bent his neck to suffering was made to
appear in his own eyes a harsh and cruel
master, who would rather see all perish
than loose his grasp on unrelenting but
impotent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>"He yielded for a moment of conscientious
alarm; he consented, though conditionally,
under false but virtuous impressions,
to the terms proposed to him
for a new concordat. But no sooner had
his upright mind discovered the error,
than it nobly and successfully repaired
it." (Chap. IV.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Such are the words of a man writing
after years of intercourse with
the first men of Europe. They are
instructive words&mdash;for human nature
is ever the same. There are men still
in Italy who follow out closely the
principles of Macchiavelli&mdash;to whom
everything sacred or profane, no
matter what veneration may have
surrounded it, is but the means
to self-aggrandizement and the
satisfaction of ambition. It is
for the nations of the world to
say whether they are willing
to allow the existence of the permanent
danger to themselves, arising
from the subjection of the spiritual
head of the church to any
crowned head or even republic
whatsoever. Perhaps, of the two,
the latter would be the more to
be dreaded. The Roman mobs that
drove Eugenius IV. from Rome, and
pelted him as he went down the
Tiber, or made many another Pope
seek safety in flight, could be easily
gotten together again, as the present
residents of the Eternal City
know only too well.</p>

<p>We answer, then, our first query,
and say that this state of things cannot
last. Time, the great remedy of
human ills, will solve this question,
and establish the See of Peter on a
perfectly independent basis&mdash;independent
of all sovereign control,
even if this be not done shortly
through the armed interference of
European powers.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to inquire
whether the Italian kingdom is so
firmly constituted that no hope of
restoration of the Pope is to be seen.
For ourselves, we think there are indications
that point to a speedy dissolution
of this state on the first
breaking out of a war between Italy
and any great power. Her policy is
to avoid entangling alliances, and
this she is following out, striving to
propitiate the Emperor of Germany
for her leaning towards France.
The first army that will enter the
peninsula to aid the Pope will shiver
Italy to fragments. The southern
provinces have too lively a recollection
of the days of plenty under
their kings, and too painful an impression
of heavy taxation and proconsular
domination of the Piedmontese
race, to hesitate between submission
to them and the regaining their own
autonomy, which will make Naples
again one of the queenly capitals of
the world.</p>

<p>One index of the general discontent
or indifference is the small
number of those who vote at the
elections in proportion to those
who are inscribed on the electoral
lists. The motto proposed by the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Unità Cattolica</i>, the foremost Catholic
journal of Italy&mdash;"<i>Neither elected
nor electors</i>"&mdash;has been adopted and
acted upon by very many throughout
the country. We feel no difficulty
in saying that the majority of
the Italians are not with the House
of Savoy, nor are they in favor of
United Italy. The ruling power has
the government and the command
of the army, a fact that quite accounts
for the existing state of
things.</p>

<p>Our third question, whether the
kingdom of Italy can be brought to
make restitution of the territories
it has seized, without itself undergoing
destruction, remains to be answered.
We believe it cannot, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
half-measures&mdash;always more or
less dangerous&mdash;be adopted. The
late spoliation is not more criminal
than the first, and no amount of
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">plébiscite</i> can make it legitimate, no
more than&mdash;to use the words of the
able editor of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Unità Cattolica</i>&mdash;the
popular approbation of the condemnation
of Jesus Christ legitimized
the crucifixion. The claim,
then, to restitution extends to the
whole of the former provinces, justly
held by the Popes to supply them
with the revenue needed to make
them independent of the precarious
contributions of the Peter Pence,
and which was none too large for
that purpose.</p>

<p>Whatever may come, we know the
future of the church is in the hands
of One in whose holding are the
hearts of princes and peoples. What
we have to do is to pray earnestly
for our spiritual head, aid him by
our means, console him with our
sympathy, and give him whatever
support, moral or other, it be in our
power to offer. And while we do so,
it is a joy to us to know we have
lessened the grief of his hardships
by what we have done hitherto, even
gladdened the hours of his captivity.
A few days ago, speaking to the
Belgian deputation, Pius IX. said:
"Belgium gives me very often proofs
of her fidelity. Continue in the way
in which you are walking; do not
allow your courage to fail. What is
happening to-day is only a trial, and
the church came into existence in
the midst of trials, lived always
amid them, and amid them she
will end her earthly career. It is
our duty to battle and stand firm in
the face of danger.... We have an
Italian proverb which says: It is
one thing to talk of dying; quite
another to die. People speak very
resignedly of persecutions, but
sometimes it is hard to bear them.
The world offers to-day a very sad
spectacle, and particularly this our
city of Rome, in which we see things
to which our eyes have not been accustomed.
Let us all pray together
that God may soon deliver his
church, and re-establish public order,
so deeply shaken. Your efforts,
your prayers, your pious pilgrimages,
all tend to this end, and I
therefore bless them with all my
heart." May the words of the
Holy Father find an echo in our
hearts; let us not lose courage, but
keep up our efforts, so happily begun,
and never rest till wrong be righted,
until we see the most sublime dignity
and power on earth freed from
the surroundings that would seek to
make it as little as themselves.</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Mechanism in Thought and Morals.</span>
An Address delivered before the Phi
Beta Kappa Society of Harvard University,
June 29, 1870. With Notes
and Afterthoughts. By Oliver Wendell
Holmes. Boston: James R. Osgood
&amp; Co. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Holmes is a Benvenuto Cellini
in literature, and everything he
produces is of precious metal, skilfully
enchased, and adorned with
gems of art. The present address
is no exception to the general rule,
but rather an unusually good illustration
of it. It is a remarkably curious
piece of work, containing many
interesting facts and speculations
derived from the author's scientific
studies on the mechanism of the
brain. There is nothing in it positively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
affirmed which is necessarily
materialistic, as far as we can see;
rather, we should say that its doctrine
stands on one side of both materialism
and spiritualism, and can
be reconciled with either. It can be
explained, if we have understood
it correctly, in conformity with the
Aristotelian and scholastic philosophy,
in such a way as not to prejudice
the truth of the distinct and
spiritual nature of the soul. The
author, indeed, appears more inclined
to that belief than the opposite,
although we are sorry to find
him expressing himself in so hesitating
and dubious a manner. When
he passes from thought to morals,
he gets out of his element, and displays
a flippancy and levity which
may pass very well in humorous
poetry, but are out of place in treating
of graver topics. His remarks
on some points of Catholic doctrine
are so completely at fault as to show
his entire incompetency to meddle
with the subject at all. His language
in regard to the Council of the
Vatican and Pius IX. is more like
that of a pert and vulgar student of
Calvinistic divinity than that of an
elegant and refined Cambridge professor.
"But political freedom inevitably
generates a new type of religious
character, as <i>the conclave that
contemplates endowing a dotard with
infallibility</i> has found out, we trust,
before this time" (p. 95). Dr.
Holmes has apparently profited by
his close observations among that
class of the female population of
Boston who are wont to thrust their
bodies half out of their windows, and
"exhaust the vocabulary, to each
other's detriment." We congratulate
him, and the learned Society of
Phi Beta Kappa, on the choice sentence
we have quoted above. We
trust those Catholics who are disposed
to think that we can make
use of Harvard University as a place
of education for our youth, will take
note of this sample of the language
they may expect to hear in that and
similar institutions, and open their
eyes to the necessity of providing
some better instruction for their
sons than can be had at such sources.
Notwithstanding our high appreciation
of Dr. Holmes's genius, and the
great pleasure we have derived from
his works, we regret to say that we
must consider his influence on young
people grievously detrimental. In
virtue of a reaction from Calvinism,
he has swung into an extreme of
rationalism the effect of which is
checked in his own person by the
influence of an unusually good heart
and an early religious education, but
in itself is sure to overthrow all reverence,
faith, and moral principle.
The whole effect of this address on
the minds of young men tends to a
most pernicious result, and encourages
them, with a kind of thoughtless
gaiety, to rush forward in a
career of mental and moral lawlessness.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Jesus and Jerusalem; or, The Way
Home.</span> Books for Spiritual Reading.
First Series. Boston: Patrick Donahoe.
1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here we have a plain, practical,
but very attractively and charmingly
written book of spiritual reading
for everybody. It emanates from
the Convent of Poor Clares, Kenmare,
County Kerry, Ireland, who
are anything but poor in intellectual
gifts and religious zeal. We suppose
it is from the pen of the gifted
authoress of the <cite>History of Ireland</cite>
and several other works of the highest
literary merit. The idea of the
volume is apparently taken from
the "Parable of a Pilgrim" in F.
Baker's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sancta Sophia</i>, of which it is
a minute paraphrase and commentary.
Its minuteness, diffuseness,
and fluency of style are, in our
opinion, great merits, considering
the end and object of the book. It
is easy reading, explains and enlarges
on each topic at length and
in detail with great tact and discretion,
and is eminently fitted to
help a person in the acquisition and
practice of the homely, everyday
Christian virtues. Its bread is of
fine quality, broken up fine. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
eminently adapted for the young and
simple, timid beginners, and persons
living an everyday busy life, and also
for the sick, the suffering, and the
afflicted. At the same time, a professor
of theology, or even a bishop,
may read it with great profit and
satisfaction. We recommend this
book with more than usual earnestness,
and we trust the good Sisters
of Kenmare will keep on with
their series, which must certainly
produce an extraordinary amount of
good.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Elia; or, Spain Fifty Years Ago.</span>
Translated from the Spanish of Fernan
Caballero. New York: Catholic Publication
Society.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fernan Caballero is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de
plume</i> of Madame de Baer, who is
now an aged lady, though still in the
full possession of her intellectual
powers. We admire the old Spanish
character, customs, faith, and chivalry.
Mme. de Baer is their champion,
and the enemy of the revolution
which has desolated that grand old
Catholic country. This is one of her
stories written to that point, and we
trust it will find even here many a
reader who will sympathize with the
author, and help to neutralize the
poison, too widely spread, of modern
liberalism&mdash;the deadly epidemic of
Spain and all Europe. It is a very
suitable book for school premiums,
and ought to be in every library.
Other persons, also, will find it a
lively and entertaining book, with a
strong dash of the peculiar quaintness
usually found in Spanish stories.</p>


<blockquote>

and Essays.</span> By J. R. Seelye,
M.D., Professor of Modern History in
the University of Cambridge. (Author
of "Ecce Homo.") Boston: Roberts
Brothers. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>These essays are cleverly and
agreeably written. Their topics are
very miscellaneous, but all of them
important and interesting. Those
on "Liberal Education in Universities,"
"English in Schools," "The
Church as a Teacher of Morality,"
and the "Teaching of Politics," are
especially worthy of attention. Some
of the writers of the "Broad Church,"
to which Prof. Seelye belongs, are
quite remarkable for their honorable
candor, largeness of mind, originality
of thought, and, in certain respects,
approximation to Catholic
views. We like to read them better
than most other Protestant writers,
and often find their writings instructive.
We have seldom seen a book
written by a Protestant in which a
Catholic can find so many things to
approve of and be pleased with, and
so few in which he is obliged to differ
from the author, as the present
volume.</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Life and Select Writings of the Ven.
Louis Marie Grignon de Montfort.</span>
Translated from the French by a Secular
Priest. London: Richardson. 1870.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Ven. Grignon de Montfort
was a priest of noble birth, who
lived and labored in France as a
missionary, and became the founder
of two religious congregations, during
the eighteenth century. He
was a person of great individuality
of character and many peculiar gifts
and traits, which made his life quite
a salient one, if we may be allowed
the expression. His talents for
poetry, music, and the arts of design,
and a marked poetic fervor in
his temperament, gave a certain zest
and raciness to his career as a missionary,
and were a great help to his
success. His character was chivalrous
and daring, and his sanctity
shows a kind of exaltation, a sort of
gay mockery of danger, contempt,
privation, and suffering, which it almost
takes one's breath away to contemplate.
His life was very short,
but his labors, persecutions, and
services were very great. He is
best known in modern times by his
extraordinary devotion to the Blessed
Virgin. It is altogether probable
that ere long the process of his canonization
will be completed, and a
decree of the Vicar of Christ enroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
his name among the saints. Those
who are capable of profiting by an
example, and by writings of such
sublime spirituality, will find something
in this book seldom to be met
with even in the Lives of Saints.</p>

<p>Chemical science, as Prof. Barker

undergone a remarkable revolution
in the last few years; and the text-books
which were excellent not long
ago are now almost useless, as far
as the theoretical part of the subject
is concerned. And though, in all
probability, more brilliant discoveries
as to the internal constitution of
matter, the formation of molecules,
and the nature of the chemical adhesion
of atoms are in store than
any yet made, still the conclusions
recently attained on these points
maybe considered as well established,
and can by no means be considered
as crude speculations, to be
overthrown to-morrow by others of
no greater weight. Chemistry seems,
at present, to promise better than
ever before to solve the problem of
the arrangement of the ultimate
material elements, though, perhaps,
the laws of the forces which connect
them, and the nature of the
molecular movements, will be rather
obtained from other sources.</p>

<p>Prof. Barker's book is an admirable
exponent of the science in its
present state. The first quarter of
it is devoted to an explanation of
the principles of theoretical chemistry,
and it is this, of course, which
is specially interesting and important
at present, though the remainder
will be found much easier reading.
The work is one, however,
which is meant to be studied, rather
than merely read, containing a great
deal of information, and giving much
material for mental exercise throughout.
It would not have been easy
to put more valuable matter in its
few pages, and its merits as a text-book
are very great. The type is
very clear, and the illustrations numerous
and excellent.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Varieties of Irish History.</span> By James
J. Gaskin. Dublin: W. B. Kelly. New
York: The Catholic Publication Society,
9 Warren Street. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Mr. Gaskin had not stated in
his preface that "the present work
is, in great part, based on a lecture
delivered by the author before a
highly influential, intelligent, and
fashionable audience," we would
have anticipated, from the title of
his book, something not only interesting
but instructive relating to
Irish history. But knowing very
well what pleases a highly fashionable
audience in the dwarfed and
provincialized capital of Ireland, this
announcement was enough to satisfy
us that his conception of what makes
history was neither very lucid nor
comprehensive. It is unnecessary
to say that, within the shadow of
Dublin Castle, any rash man who
would be unthinking enough to
write or speak seriously about the
history of Ireland&mdash;that protracted
tragedy upon which the curtain has
not yet fallen&mdash;would soon be voted
a bore, or something worse, by the
fashionable people who are privileged
once or twice a year to kiss the
hand of the representative of royalty.
But the author is evidently too
well bred to commit such a solecism,
and accordingly, under a very attractive
exterior, he treats us to all
sorts of gossip, from the doings of
<i>Gra na' Uile</i>, a sort of western Viqueen,
to the murder of Captain Glas,
a Scotch privateersman. The intervals
between these two great historical
events is filled up with the mock
regal ceremonies that used to be observed
annually on the island of
Dalkey; reminiscences of Swift, Dr.
Delaney, Curran, and other distinguished
men of the last century,
which, though not new, are pleasant
to read; and some correct and elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
descriptions of scenery in the
suburbs of Dublin, which will not be
without interest to those who have
visited that part of Ireland. The
<cite>Varieties</cite> is not a book which will
find much favor with historical students,
but for railroad and steamboat
travellers, who wish to read as
they run, and as a book for the
drawing-room, being light in style
and handsomely illustrated, it will
be found entertaining and agreeable.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">A Hand-Book of Legendary and Mythological
Art.</span> By Clara Erskine
Clement. With Descriptive Illustrations.
New York: Hurd &amp; Houghton.</p></blockquote>

<p>The best thing we can say about
this book is that it affords another
striking proof that the Catholic
Church is the genius of all true
poetry and art. One-half of the
volume is devoted to sketches of
the lives of Catholic saints, the other
half being equally divided between
legends of German localities and the
gods and goddesses of Greece and
Rome. We look in vain for some
notice of works of art or poetic legend
to which Protestantism, with
its heroes, or modern Rationalism,
with no heroes, has given inspiration.
The authoress, however, is
not a Catholic, for she calls us
"Romanists," a vulgar term, the use
of which, she ought to know, we consider
as impertinent and insulting.</p>

<p>False legends and true biographies
of our saints are strung together
without discrimination. This we
would not complain of so much, if,
as she would seem to imply, they are
both illustrated by art; but the instances
in which these apocryphal
and unworthy stories have been
chosen by the painter or sculptor as
fitting subjects are exceedingly rare,
and where they are, as in the case
of Durer's painting of "St. John
Chrysostom's Penance," which is
reproduced by the authoress (shall
we say with her in the preface, "to
interest and instruct her children"?),
they bear evidence of an art degraded
in inspiration and debased
in morals.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Sarsfield; or, The Last Great Struggle
for Ireland.</span> By D. P. Conyngham.
Boston: Patrick Donahoe.</p></blockquote>

<p>This short historical novel has
been written for two purposes&mdash;to
disprove the correctness of the saying,
attributed to Voltaire, that the
Irish always fought badly at home,
and to illustrate, in a popular manner,
the struggle between James II.
and his son-in-law, the Prince of
Orange. With due respect to the
author, we submit that too much
importance has already been attached
to Voltaire's <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</i> with regard
to the fighting qualities of the
Irish. It is of little importance, indeed,
what that gifted infidel has
said about anything or anybody, as
it is pretty well understood in our
day that among his numerous failings
veracity was not very conspicuous.
Mr. Conyngham has, however,
succeeded very creditably in accomplishing
his main object, and presents
us with a succinct and truthful
view of the rival forces which, for
three years, contested for the English
crown on the soil of Ireland.
There is very little plot in the story,
the principal interest centring in
the acts of Sarsfield and other well-known
historical personages; but
the narrative of the war is well sustained,
and the author's conception
of the inner life of his principal
characters is in the main correct and
natural.</p>

The fact that the characters have

the story a little obscure at times.
This, however, will not prevent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
boys who enjoy tales of perilous

<p>We have read this unpretending

The author is a true poet, and has
the merit of originality quite as much
as of descriptive power. His more
serious poems display a high appreciation
of the beautiful and the romantic,
and there is a Catholic tone
about them. Those in dialect, with
the other humorous pieces, are
equally pleasing in their way. The
former, particularly, reflect a side of
life which is generally supposed the
least poetical of all. Mr. Bret Harte
has "gathered honey from the weed."</p>

<h2>THE CHURCH ACCREDITS HERSELF<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></h2>

<p>Archbishop Manning's pastoral
letter to his clergy on the first council,
<cite>The Vatican and its Definitions</cite>, to
which are appended the two constitutions
the council adopted&mdash;the one
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Constitutio de Fide Catholica</i>, and
the other the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Constitutio Dogmatica
Prima de Ecclesia</i>&mdash;the case of Honorius,
and the Letter of the German
bishops on the council, though containing
little that is new to our readers,
is a volume which is highly
valuable in itself, and most convenient
to every Catholic who would
know the real character of the council
and what is the purport of its
definitions. Few members of the
council were more assiduous in their
attendance on its sessions or took
a more active part in its deliberations
than the illustrious Archbishop of
Westminster, and no one can give a
more trustworthy account of its dispositions
or of its acts. We are
glad, therefore, that the volume has
been republished in this country, and
hope it will be widely read both by
Catholics and non-Catholics.</p>

<p>The character of the book and of
the documents it contains renders any
attempt by us either to review it or to
explain it alike unnecessary and impertinent.
The pastoral is addressed
officially by the Archbishop to his
clergy; the constitutions or definitions
adopted by the Holy Synod declare,
by the assistance of the Holy Ghost,
what is, and always has been, and
always will be the Catholic faith on
the matters defined; and we need not
say that we cordially accept it as the
word of God, and as the faith which
all must accept <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex animo</i>, and without
which it is impossible to please God.
What the council has defined is the
law of God, and binds us as if spoken
to us directly by God himself in a
voice from heaven. He speaks to us
by his church, his organ, and her
voice is in fact his voice, and what
we take on her authority we take on
his authority, for he assists her,
vouches for her, and commands us
to believe and obey her.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, enemies of the
faith who pretend that Catholics believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
solely on the authority of the
church as an organic body; but this
is a misapprehension. We believe
what is revealed on the veracity of
God alone, because it is his word,
and it is impossible for his word to
be false; and we believe that it is his
word on the authority or testimony
of the church, with whom the word is
deposited, and who is its divinely
commissioned keeper, guardian, witness,
and interpreter. The word of
God is and must be true, and there is
and can be no higher ground of faith
or even of knowledge than the fact
that God says it. Nothing can be
more consonant to reason than to
believe God on his word. Certainly, it
is answered, if we have his word;
but how do I know that what is proposed
to me as his word is his word?
We take the fact that it is his word
on the authority of the Catholic
Church; we believe it is his word
because she declares it to be his
word. It is permitted no one to
doubt the word of God is conceded;
but whence from that fact does it
follow that I am not permitted to
doubt the word of the church? Or
why should I believe her testimony
or her declaration rather than that of
any one else?</p>

<p>To this question the general answer
is, that she has been divinely
instituted, and is protected and assisted
to bear true witness to the
revelation which it has pleased God
to make, to proclaim it, declare its
sense, and condemn whatever impugns
or tends to obscure it. Supposing
she has been instituted and
commissioned by our Lord himself,
for this very purpose, her authority
is sufficient for believing whatever
she teaches and declares or defines
to be the word of God is his word
or the truth he has revealed; for the
divine commission is the divine
word pledged for her veracity and
infallibility. This is plain enough and
indubitable; but how am I to know
or to be assured that she has been
so instituted or commissioned, and is
so assisted?</p>

<p>There are several answers to this
question; but we would remark,
before proceeding to give any answer,
that the church is in possession,
has from the moment of the descent
of the Holy Ghost upon the apostles
on the day of Pentecost claimed
to be in possession of the authority in
question, and has had her claim acknowledged
by the whole body of
the faithful, and denied by none except
those who deny or impugn
authority itself. Being in possession,
it is for those who question her right
to show that she is wrongfully in
possession. They are, to use a legal
term, the plaintiffs in action, and
must make out their case. Every
one is presumed in law to be innocent
till proven guilty. The church
must be presumed to be rightfully in
possession till the contrary is shown.
They who question her possession
must, then, adduce at least <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima
facie</i> evidence for ousting her before
she can be called upon to produce
her title-deeds. This has never been
done, and never can be done; for, if
it could be done, some of our able and
learned Protestant divines would, in
the course of the last three hundred
years and over, have done it. There is,
then, in reality no need, in order to justify
the faith of Catholics, to prove by
extrinsic testimony the divine institution
and commission of the church to
teach all men and nations all things
whatsoever God has revealed and
commanded to be believed.</p>

<p>But we have no disposition to
avail ourselves just now of what some
may regard as a mere legal technicality.
We answer the question by
saying the church is herself the witness
in the case, and accredits herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
or her existence itself proves her
divine institution, commission, and
assistance or guidance.</p>

<p>The church was founded by our
Lord on the prophets and apostles,
being himself the chief corner-stone.
This is asserted here as a simple historical
fact. Historically, the church
has existed, without any break or
defect of continuity, from the apostles
down to our times. Its unbroken
existence from that time to
this cannot be questioned. It has
been a fact during all that period
in the world's history, and too momentous
a fact to escape observation.
Indeed, it has been the one great
fact of history for over eighteen
hundred years; the central fact
around which all the facts of history
have revolved, and without which
they would be inexplicable and
meaningless. This assumed or granted,
it must be conceded that she
unites as one continuous fact, in one
body, the apostles and the believers
of to-day. She is a continuous fact;
a present fact during all the period
of time that has elapsed between the
apostles and us, and therefore is alike
present to them and to us. Her existence
being unbroken, she has never
fallen into the past; never been a past
fact; but has always been and is a present
fact; and therefore as present with
the apostles to-day as she was on the
day of Pentecost, when they received
the Holy Ghost; and therefore presents
us not simply what they taught,
but what they teach her now and
here. She bridges over the abyss
of time between our Lord himself
and us, and makes us and the
apostles, so to speak, contemporaries;
so that, as it is our Lord himself
we hear in the apostles, so it is
the apostles themselves that we hear
in her.</p>

<p>This continuity or unity of the
church in time is a simple historical
fact, and as certain as any other historical
fact, and even more so, for it
is a fact that has never fallen into
the past, and to be established only
by trustworthy witnesses or documents.
By it the church to-day is
and must be as apostolic and as authoritative
as in the days of the apostles
Peter, James, and John. Individuals
die, but the church dies not;
individuals are changed, as are the
particles of our bodies, but the church
changes not. As in the human race
individuals pass off, but the race remains
always the same; so in the
church individuals pass away, but
the church remains unchanged in all
its integrity; for the individuals die
not all at once, and the new individuals
born in their places are born
into the one identical body, that does
not die, but remains ever the same.
No matter, then, how many generations
succeed one another in their
birth and death, the body of the
church is subject to no law of succession,
and remains not only one
and the same church, but always the
one and the same present church.
The church of to-day is identically
the church of yesterday, the church
of yesterday is identically the church
of the day before, and thus step by
step back to the apostles; on the other
hand, the church in the time of
the apostles is identically the church
of their successors down through all
succeeding generations of individuals
to us. There has never been an interval
of time when it was not, or
when it lost its identity as one and
the same body. The church is precisely
as apostolic now as it was in
the beginning, or as were the apostles
themselves.</p>

<p>Now, if we suppose our Lord communicated
the whole revelation to
the apostles either by his personal
teaching or by the inspiration of the
Holy Ghost, then he communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it to her, and she is an eye and ear
witness to the fact of revelation in
the same sense that the apostles
were, and her historical identity with
the apostles makes her a perpetual
and contemporary witness to the fact
of revelation and to what is revealed.
What misleads not a few on this
point is that they regard the church
as a mere aggregation of individuals,
born and dying with them, or succeeding
to herself with the succession
of each new generation of individuals.
But this is no more the
case with the church than with the
human race itself, or with any particular
nation that has an historical
existence through several generations.
In all historical bodies the generations
overlap one another, and no
generation of individuals is either
aggregated to the body or segregated
from it all at once. The body
does not die with the receding nor
is it born anew with the acceding
generation. The church, indeed, is
an organism, not a mere aggregation
of individuals, but even if it were
the conclusion would not follow; for
though the individuals are successively
aggregated or affiliated, they are
aggregated or affiliated to her as a
persistent body, and though they pass
off successively, they leave the body
standing, one and identical. This is
the simple historical fact. The church,
as an ever-present body, remains one
and the same identical body amid
all the successive changes of individuals,
and is just as much the depositary
of the revelation and an eye-witness
of the facts recorded in the
Gospels, as were the apostles themselves.</p>

<p>We say, then, the church is herself
the witness, and a competent and
credible witness, to her own divine
commission to teach and declare the
word of God which he has revealed,
and no better, no more competent
or credible witness is needed or, in
fact, conceivable. She is competent
because she is the identical apostolical
body, the contemporary and the
eye-witness through the successive
ages of the facts to which she testifies.
She is a credible witness, because
even as a human body it would
be hardly possible for her either to
mistake or to misrepresent the facts
to which she testifies, since they are
always present before her eyes, since,
however her individual members
may change, she herself knows no
change with lapse of time, and no
succession. She could not forget the
faith, change it, or corrupt it, because
there is at all times in her communion
an innumerable body of living
witnesses to its unity, purity, and integrity,
who would detect the change
or alteration and expose it. It is
not with her as it would be with a
book having a limited circulation.
Copies of the book could easily be
altered or interpolated without detection;
but the living testimony of the
church, spread over the whole world
and teaching all nations, cannot be
interpolated or corrupted. It is on
the fidelity of the church, her vigilant
guardianship, and uniform
testimony that we depend for our
confidence in the genuineness and authenticity
of our copies of the sacred
writings, and it is worthy of note
that in proportion as men throw off
the authority of the church, and reject
her traditions, they lose that confidence,
and fail to agree among
themselves what books, if any, are
inspired; so that without the testimony
of the church the Holy Scriptures
themselves cease to be an authority
in matters of faith.</p>

<p>In human tribunals the supreme
court is presumed to know the law
which constitutes it, and it defines
its own jurisdiction and powers. It
declares the law of which it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
depositary and guardian, and though
the judges have only their human
wisdom, learning, and sagacity, it is
remarkable how few mistakes through
a long series of ages they commit
as to what is or is not the law they
are appointed to administer, and
nearly all the mistakes they do commit
are due to the changes the legislature
makes in the law or in the
constitution of the court. Why should
the church be less competent to
judge of the law under which she
is constituted, and to define her jurisdiction
and powers? And since
her constitution, as well as the law
she administers, changes not, why
should she be less exempt, even as a
human court, from mistakes in interpreting
and declaring the law, than
the supreme court of England or
the United States? What higher
authority can there be to judge of
her own constitution and the law
given her to administer than the
church herself?</p>

<p>The church received her constitution
in the commission given to the
apostolic body with whom she is one
and identical, and the law or revealed
word in the reception of it by the
apostles. Being one and identical
body with them, she has received
what they received, and knows what
they knew, is taught what they were
taught, understands it in the same
sense that they did, and has the same
authority to interpret and declare it
that they had. If they were commissioned
to teach all nations to observe
all things whatsoever our Lord
commanded them, she is commissioned
in their commission to do the
same. If he promised them his efficacious
presence and assistance to
the consummation of the world, he
made the promise to her; if he made
Peter the prince of the apostles, the
father and teacher of all Christians,
and gave him plenary authority to
feed, rule, and govern the universal
church, he made the successor of
Peter the visible head of the church,
and gave him the same authority.
The church, being the apostolic body
persisting through all times, knows
what the apostles received, knows
therefore both her own constitution
and the law deposited with her, and is
as competent to judge of them as the
apostles were, and has full authority
to interpret and declare both, and it
is to her, as to the supreme court of
a nation, to judge what they are, and
to define her constitution, jurisdiction,
and powers.</p>

<p>The objection which many make
to this conclusion arises from their
confounding the authority of the
church to interpret and define the
law&mdash;and, as a part of the law, her
own constitution, jurisdiction, and
powers or functions&mdash;with the authority
to make the law: a mistake like
that of confounding the supreme
court of the United States with Congress.
The church, like the court or
the supreme executive, may make her
own rules and orders&mdash;what are
called the orders and rules of court,
for the purpose of carrying out the
intent of the law&mdash;but she no more
makes the law than does the civil
court make the law under which it is
constituted, and which it administers.
God alone is the lawgiver or lawmaker,
and his revealed word is the
law&mdash;the law for the human reason
and will, and which binds all men in
thought, word, and deed. We want
no church, as the supreme judge of
the law, to tell us this, for it is a dictamen
of reason itself. It is the revealed
word of God, which again is
only his will, the will of the supreme
Lawgiver&mdash;that is the law under
which the church is constituted, and
which she guards, interprets, and declares,
whenever a question of law
arises. She does not make the law;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
she keeps, interprets, declares, and
defends or vindicates it. Even with
only human wisdom, she can no more
make the law, or declare that to be
law which is not, than the supreme
civil court can declare that to be civil
law which is not civil law. The objection,
therefore, is not well taken.</p>

<p>The law, it is agreed on all hands&mdash;that
is, the revelation, whether written
or unwritten&mdash;was deposited with
the apostles, then it was deposited, as
we have seen, with the church identical
with the apostolic body. Now,
she knows, as the apostles knew, what
she received, the law committed to
her charge, and, as she is constituted
by the law she has received, she
knows, and cannot but know, her
own constitution and powers, also
what promises, if any, she has received
from her divine Lawgiver and
Founder. The promises of God cannot
fail; and if he has promised her
his assistance as an immunity from
error she knows it, and knows that
her judgments of law, or in matters
of faith, are through that assistance
infallible. Of all these questions she
is the divinely constituted judge. She
is the judge of the law constituting
her, of her own appointment and
commission, and of her rights, powers,
and jurisdiction, no less than of
the law or revelation committed to
her charge, for all this is included in
the law. If she defines that in her
commission is included the promise
of the divine assistance to protect
her from error in interpreting and declaring
the law&mdash;that is, the faith, the
revealed word of God&mdash;then of all
this she judges infallibly, and she is
the infallible authority, not for believing
what God has revealed&mdash;for that
is believed on the veracity of God
alone&mdash;but for believing that what she
teaches as his revealed word is his
revealed word, and therefore the law
we are to obey in thought, word,
deed, as the supreme court is the
authority for defining its own constitution
and powers, and what is or is
not the law of the state. Say we not,
then, truly that the church is her
own witness and accredits herself?
Say we not truly, also, that she is the
faithful and infallible witness to the fact
of revelation, and teacher and judge
of what God has or has not revealed?
The fact, then, that the church
defines that she is the divinely appointed
guardian and infallible teacher
and judge of revelation, is all we
need to know in order to know that
it is God we believe in believing her.</p>

<p>None of the sects can apply this
argument to themselves; for no one
of them can pretend to be the identical
apostolical body, or to span the
distance of time from the apostles to
us, so as to be at once their contemporary
and ours. They all have
either originated too late or have died
too soon for that. Not one of them
can pretend to have originated in the
apostolic communion, and to have
existed as one continuous body down
to us. There were sectaries in the
lifetime of the apostles, but they were
not in the apostolic communion, but
separated from it; and there is, as far
as we know, no sect in existence that
originated in apostolic times. Some
of the Gnostic sects sprang up at a
very early day, but they have all
disappeared, though many of their
errors are revived in our day. The
Nestorian and Jacobite sects still
subsist in the East, but they were
born too late to be of apostolic origin,
and our modern Unitarians
are not the old Arians continued
in one unbroken body. The Lutheran
and Calvinistic sects are of yesterday,
and they and their numerous
offshoots are out of the question.
The poor Anglicans talk of apostolic
succession indeed, but they separated
or were cut off from the apostolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
body in the sixteenth century, and,
with all the pretensions of a few of
them, are only a Protestant sect, born
of the Reformation, as the greater part
of them strenuously contend. There is
something in people's instincts; and it
is worthy of note that no people who
have cast off the authority of the
Holy See have ever ventured to assume
as their official name the title
of <span class="smcap lowercase">APOSTOLIC</span>. Even the schismatic
Greeks, while they claim to be orthodox,
do not officially call their
church apostolic; and the American
Anglicans assume only the name of
Protestant Episcopal. <i>Protestant apostolic</i>
would strike the whole world
as incongruous, and very much as a
contradiction in terms.</p>

<p>Let the argument be worth little
or much, the only body claiming to
be the church of Christ that has or
has had an uninterrupted historical
existence from the apostles to us, is
the body that is in communion with
the See of Rome, and recognizes the
successor of Peter in that see as
the Vicar of Christ, the teacher of
the nations, supreme pastor of the
faithful, with plenary authority from
our Lord himself to feed, rule, and
govern the universal church. The
fact is too plain on the very face of
history for any one who knows history
at all to deny it. Nor, in fact,
does any one deny it. All in reality
concede it; and the pretence is that
to be in communion with that see is
not necessary in order to be in communion
with Christ, or with the universal
church.</p>

<p>But this is a question of law or of
its interpretation, and can itself be
determined only by the supreme
court instituted to keep, interpret, and
declare the law. The court of last
resort has already decided the question.
It is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res adjudicata</i>, and no longer
an open question. The court has
decided that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra ecclesiam, nulla
salus</i>, or, that out of communion
with the church there is no communion
with Christ; and that out of
communion with the Holy See there
is no communion with the universal
church, for there is no such church.
Do you appeal from the decision
of the court? To what tribunal?
To a higher tribunal? But there is
no higher tribunal than the court of
last resort. None of the sects are
higher than the church, or competent
to set aside or overrule her decisions.
Do you appeal to the Bible? But
this were only appealing from the
law as expounded by the church or
the supreme court to the law as expounded
by yourself or your sect.
Such an appeal cannot be entertained,
for it is an appeal, not from an
inferior court to a superior, but from
the highest court to the lowest. The
law expounded by the individual or
the sect is below, not above, the law
expounded and declared by the
church. The sect has confessedly
no authority, and the law expounded
and applied by the sect is no more
than the law expounded and applied
by the private individual; and no private
individual is allowed to expound
and apply the law for himself, but
must take it as expounded and applied
by the court, and the judgment as to
what the law is of the court of last
resort is final, and from it, as every
lawyer knows, there lies no appeal.
To be able to set aside or overrule
the judgment of the church, it is necessary,
then, to have a court of superior
jurisdiction, competent to revise
her judgments and to confirm
or to overrule them. But, unhappily
for those who are dissatisfied with
her judgments, there is and can be
no such court to which they can appeal.</p>

<p>There might be some plausibility
in the pretended appeal from the
church to the Bible, if the church had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
not the Bible, or if she avowedly
rejected its divine authority; but as
the case stands, such an appeal is
irregular, illegal, and absurd. The
church has and always has had the
Bible ever since it was written. It was,
as we have seen, originally deposited
with her, and it is only from her that
those outside of her communion have
obtained it or their knowledge of it.
She has always held and taught it
to be the divinely inspired and authoritative
written word of God, which
none of her children are allowed to
deny or question. There is no opposition
possible between her teaching
and the Bible, for the Bible is
included in her teaching, and consequently
no appeal from her teaching
to the Bible. It would be only an
appeal from herself to herself. The
only appeal conceivable in the case
is from her understanding of the sacred
Scriptures or the revealed word
of God to&mdash;your own; but as you
at best have confessedly no authority
to expound, interpret, or declare
the law, your understanding
of the written word can in no case
override or set aside hers.</p>

<p>The Reformers, when they pretended
to appeal from the church to
the Bible, mistook the question and
proceeded on a false assumption.
There never was any question between
the church and the Bible; the
only question there was or could be
was between her understanding of
the Bible and theirs, or, as we have
said, between the Bible as expounded
by the church and the Bible as
expounded by private individuals.
This the Reformers did not or would
not see, and this their followers do
not or will not see to this day. Now,
count the authority of the church for
as little as possible, her understanding
cannot be below that of private
individuals, and the understanding
of private individuals can never override
it, or be a sufficient reason for
setting it aside. The Reformers had
recognized the church as the supreme
authority in matters of faith, and the
question was not on admitting her
authority as something hitherto unrecognized,
but on rejecting an
authority they had hitherto acknowledged
as divine. They could
not legally reject it except on a higher
authority, or by the judgment of
a superior court. But there was no
superior court, no higher authority,
and they could oppose to her not the
authority of the Bible, as they pretended,
but at best only their private
opinion or views of what it
teaches, which in no case could count
for more than her judgment, and
therefore could not overrule it or authorize
its rejection.</p>

<p>It is all very well to deny the
divine commission and authority of
the church to expound the word and
declare the law of God; but a denial,
to serve any purpose, or to be worth
anything, must have a reason, and a
higher reason than has the affirmation
denied. One can deny only by
an authority sufficient to warrant an
affirmation. It needs as much reason
to deny as to affirm. The authority
of the church can really be denied
only by opposing to her a truth
that disproves it. A simple negation
is nothing, and proves or disproves
nothing. Yet the Reformers opposed
to the church only a simple negation.
They opposed to her no authority,
no affirmative truth, and consequently
gave no reason for denying or unchurching
her. Indeed, no individual
or sect ever opposes either to
the church or to her teaching anything
but simple negation, and no
one ever makes an affirmation or
affirms any truth or positive doctrine
which she does not herself affirm
or hold and teach. Every known
heresy, from that of the Docetæ down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to the latest development of Protestantism,
simply denies what the church
teaches, and affirms nothing which
she does not herself affirm, as Catholics
have shown over and over again.
These denials, based as they are on
no principle or affirmative truth, are
gratuitous, and count for nothing
against the church or her teaching.
Who would count the denial by a
madman that the sun shines in a clear
sky at noonday?</p>

<p>The simple fact is that whoever
denies the church or her judgments
does it without any authority or
reason but his own private opinion or
caprice, and that is simply no authority
or reason at all. It is not possible
to allege any authority against
her or her teaching. Men may cavil
at the truth, may by their sophistries
and subtleties obscure the truth or
involve themselves in a dense mental
fog, so that they are unable to see
anything distinctly, or to tell where
they are or in what direction they
are moving. They may thus imagine
that they have some reason for
their denials, and even persuade
others that such is the fact; but whenever
the fog is cleared away, and
they have <i>easted</i> themselves, they cannot,
if they have ordinary intelligence,
fail to discover that the truth which
in their own minds they opposed to
her or her teaching is a truth which
she herself holds and teaches as an
integral part of her doctrine, or as
included in the depositum of faith
she has received. Do you say there
is truth outside of the church; truth
in all religions; in all superstitions,
even? Be it so; but there is no
truth outside of her in any religion or
superstition that she denies or does
not recognize and hold, and hold in
its unity and catholicity. There may
be facts in natural history, in physics,
chemistry, in all the special sciences,
as in the several handicrafts, that she
does not teach; but there is no principle
of science of any sort that she
does not hold and apply whenever
an occasion for its application occurs.
None of the special sciences have
their principles in themselves, or do
or can demonstrate the principles on
which they depend, and from which
they derive their scientific character.
They all depend for their scientific
character on a higher science, the
science of sciences, which the church
and the church alone teaches. The
principles of ethics, and therefore of
politics as a branch of ethics, all
lie in the theological order, and
without theology there is and can be
no science of ethics or politics; and
hence we see that both, with those who
reject theology, are purely empirical,
without any scientific basis. An
atheist may be moral in his conduct,
but if there were no God there
could be no morality; so may an
atheist be a geometrician, but if there
were no God there could be no geometry.
Deny God, and what becomes
of lines that may be infinitely
projected, or of space shading off into
immensity, on which so much in the
science of geometry depends? Nay,
deny God, and what would become
even of finite space? Yet without the
conception of space, which is in
truth only the power of God to externize
his acts, geometry would be
impossible. All the special sciences
are secondary, and are really science
only when carried up to their first
principles and explained by them.
What more absurd, then, than the attempt
of scientists to prove by science
there is no God, or to oppose
science to the theology of the church,
without which no science is possible?</p>

<p>We need but look at the present
state of men's minds to see how the
world gets on without the church.
Never were men more active or indefatigable
in their researches: they send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
their piercing glances into all subjects,
sacred and profane; they investigate
the heavens and the earth, the present
and the past, and leave no nook or
corner of nature unexplored, and yet
there is not a principle of ethics, politics,
or science that is not denied or
called in question. In the moral and
political world nothing is fixed or
settled, and moral and intellectual
science, as well as statesmanship, disappears.
Doubt and uncertainty
hang over all questions, and the distinctions
between right and wrong,
just and unjust, as well as between
good and evil, are obscured and well-nigh
obliterated. The utmost confusion
reigns in the whole world of
thought, and "men," as a distinguished
prelate said to us the other
day, "are trying the experiment of
governing the world without conscience."
All this proves what we
maintain, that they who deny the
church, or reject her teaching, have
no truth to oppose to her, no reason
for their denial, and no principle on
which they base their rejection of
her authority. Their rejection of the
church and her teaching is purely
gratuitous, and therefore, if not sinful,
is at least baseless.</p>

<p>This much is certain, that it is
either the church or nothing. There
is no other alternative. Nothing is
more absurd than for those who reject
the church and her teaching
to pretend to be Christian teachers
or believers. They cannot believe
the revelation God has made on the
veracity of God alone, for they have
no witness, not even an unassisted
human witness, of the fact of revelation,
of what God has revealed, or
that he has or has not revealed anything,
since they have no witness
who was the contemporary of our
Lord and his apostles&mdash;they were
none of them born then&mdash;and they
have no institution that dates from
apostolic times, and that has continued
without break down to the
present. In fact, what they profess
to believe, in so far as they believe it
at all, they believe on the authority
of the church, or of that very tradition
which they reject and deny to be
authority. They agree among themselves
in their doctrinal belief only
when and where they agree with
the church; whenever and wherever
they break from Catholic tradition,
preserved and handed down by her,
they disagree and fight with one another,
are all at sea, and have neither
chart nor compass. Do they tell us
that they agree in the essentials of
the Christian faith? Yet it is only so
far as they follow Catholic tradition
that they know or can agree among
themselves as to what are or
are not essentials. There is a wide
difference between what Dr. Pusey
holds to be essential and what is held
to be essential by Dr. Bellows. Nearly
the only point in which the two agree
is in rejecting the infallible authority
of the successor of Peter; and, in rejecting
that authority, neither has any
authority for believing what he believes,
or for denying what he denies.
Deny the church, and you have no
authority for asserting divine revelation
at all, as your rationalists and
radicals conclusively prove.</p>

<p>But, happily, the other alternative
saves us from all these logical inconsistencies.
The church meets every
demand, removes every embarrassment,
and affords us the precise authority
we need for faith, for she is
in every age and every land a living
witness to the fact of revelation, and
an ever-present judge competent to
declare what God reveals, and to
teach us what we have, and what we
have not, the veracity of God for believing.
She can assure us of the
divine inspiration and authority of
the Holy Scriptures, which without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
her tradition is not provable; for she
has received them through the apostles
from our Lord himself. She can
enable us to read them aright, and
can unfold to us by her teaching their
real sense; for the Holy Ghost has
deposited with her the whole revelation
of God, whether written or unwritten.
Outside of her, men, if
they have the book called the Bible,
can make little or nothing of it, can
come to no agreement as to its sense,
except so far as they inconsistently
and surreptitiously avail themselves of
her interpretation of it. They have
no key to its sense. But she has the
key to its meaning in her possession
and knowledge of all that God reveals,
or in the divine instruction she
has received in the beginning. The
whole word of God, and the word
of God as a whole, is included in
the depositum she has received, and
therefore she is able at all times and
in all places to give the true sense
of the whole, and of the relation
to the whole of each and every
part. In her tradition the Bible
is a book of divine instruction, of
living truth, of inestimable value,
and entitled to the profoundest reverence,
which we know it is not in the
hands of those who wrest it from her
tradition, and have no clue to its
meaning but grammar and lexicon.</p>

<p>The notion that a man who knows
nothing of the Christian faith, and is
a stranger to the whole order of
Christian thought and life, can take
up the Bible, even when correctly
translated into his mother-tongue,
and from reading and studying it arrive
at an adequate knowledge, or
any real knowledge at all, of Christian
truth or the revelation which
God has made to man, is preposterous,
and contradicted by every day's
experience. Just in proportion as
men depart from the tradition of faith
preserved by the church, the Bible
becomes an unintelligible book, ceases
to be of any use to the mind,
and, if reverenced at all, becomes,
except in a few plain moral precepts,
a source of error much more frequently
than of truth. One of the
most precious gifts of God to man
becomes instead of a benefit a real
injury to the individual and to society.
Our school-boards may, then,
easily understand why we Catholics
object to the reading of the Bible in
schools where the church cannot be
present to enlighten the pupil's mind
as to its real and true sense. It
is the court that keeps the statute-books,
and interprets and applies the
law, whether the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex scripta</i> or the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex non scripta</i>.</p>

<p>The church, existing in all ages
and in all nations as one identical
body, is a living witness in all times
and places, as we have said, of the
fact that God has revealed what she
believes and teaches, and is through
his assistance a competent and sufficient
authority for that fact, and to
interpret and declare the revealed
law, as much so, to say the least, as
the supreme court of a nation is to
declare what is the law of the state.
The objection made by rationalists
and others to believing on the authority
of the church, or to recognizing
her authority to declare the faith, is
founded on the false assumption that
the church makes the faith, and can
make anything of faith she pleases,
whether God has revealed it or not.
We have already answered this objection.
The church bears witness
to the fact of revelation, and declares
what is or is not the faith God has
revealed, as the supreme court declares
what is or is not the law of
the state; but she can declare nothing
to be of faith that is not of faith,
or that God has not revealed and
commanded all men to believe, for
through the divine assistance she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
infallible, and therefore cannot err in
matters of faith, or in any matters
pertaining in any respect to faith and
morals. Since she cannot err in declaring
what God has revealed and
commanded, we are assured that
what she declares to be revealed is
revealed, or to be commanded is commanded,
and therefore we know that
whatever we are required to believe
as of faith, or to do as commanded
of God, we have the authority of
God himself for believing and doing,
the highest possible reason for faith,
since God is truth itself, and can neither
deceive nor be deceived; and the
highest possible law, for God is the
Supreme Lawgiver. It is they who
reject the church or deny her authority
that have only an arbitrary and
capricious human authority, and who
abdicate their reason and their freedom,
and make themselves slaves,
and slaves of human passion, arrogance,
and ignorance. The Catholic
is the only man who has true mental
freedom, or a reason for his faith.
His faith makes him free. It is the
truth that liberates; and therefore our
Lord says, "If the Son shall make
you free, ye shall be free indeed."
Who can be freer than he who is held
to believe and obey only God? They
whom the truth does not make free
may fancy they are free, but they are
not; they are in bondage, and abject
slaves.</p>

<p>The church in affirming herself is
not making herself the judge in her
own cause, is not one of the litigants, as
some pretend, for the cause in which
she judges is not hers, but that of
God himself. She is the court instituted
by the Supreme Lawgiver to
keep, interpret, and declare his law,
and therefore to judge between him
and the subjects his law binds. She,
in determining a case of faith or morals,
no more judges in her own cause
than the supreme court of a nation
does in defining its own jurisdiction,
and in determining a case arising under
the law of which it is constituted
by the national authority the judge.
She has, of course, the right, as has
every civil court, to punish contempt,
whether of her orders or her jurisdiction,
for he who contemns her contemns
him who has instituted her;
but the questions to be decided are
questions of law, which she does not
make, and is therefore no more a
party to the cause litigated, and no
more interested or less impartial, than
is a civil court in a civil action. Indeed,
we see not, if it pleases Almighty
God to make a revelation, and to set
up his kingdom on earth with that
revelation for its law, how he can
provide for its due administration
without such a body as the church
affirms herself to be, nor how it would
be possible to institute a higher or
more satisfactory method of determining
what the law of his kingdom
is, than by the decision of a court
instituted and assisted by him for that
very purpose. In our judgment, no
better way is practicable, and no other
way of attaining the end desired
is possible. We repeat, therefore, that
the church meets every demand of
the case, and removes every real difficulty
in ascertaining what is the
faith God has revealed, as well as
what is opposed to it, or tends to obscure
or impair it.</p>

<p>It is agreed on all hands, by all
who hold that our heavenly Father
has made us a revelation and instituted
a church, that the Church of
Rome, founded by Saints Peter and
Paul, was in the beginning catholic
and apostolic. If she was so in the
beginning, she is so now; for she has
not changed, and claims no authority
which she has not claimed and exercised,
as the occasion arose, from the
first. She is the same identical body
as she has been from the beginning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
All the sectarian and schismatical
bodies that oppose or refuse to submit
to her authority acknowledged
her authority prior to rejecting it, and
were in communion with her. The
change is not hers, but theirs. They
have changed and gone out from her,
because they were not of her, but she
has remained ever the same. Take
the schismatic Greeks. They originally
were one body with her, and
held the successor of Peter in the
Roman See as primate or head of the
whole visible church. They got angry
or were perverted, and rejected the
authority of the Roman Pontiff, and
have never even to this day ventured
to call themselves officially the Catholic
or the Apostolic church. The men
who founded the Reformed Churches
so-called&mdash;Anglican among
the rest&mdash;were brought up in the
communion of the Catholic Church,
and acknowledged the supremacy of
the Roman Pontiff, and the Church
of Rome as the mother and mistress
of all the churches. The separation
was caused by their change, not by
hers. She held and taught at the
time of the separation what she had
always held and taught, and claimed
no authority which she had not
claimed from the first. Evidently,
then, it was they and not she that
changed and denied what they had
previously believed. She lost individuals
and nations from her communion,
but she lost not her identity,
or any portion of her rights and
authority, as the one and only church
of Christ, for she holds from God, not
from the faithful. She has continued
to be what she was at first, while
they have gone from one change to
another, have fallen into a confusion
of tongues, as their prototypes did at
Babel; and Luther and Calvin could
hardly recognize their followers in
those who go by their name to-day.</p>

<p>In the very existence of the church
through so many changes in the world
around her, the rise and fall of states
and empires, assailed as she has been
on every hand, and by all sorts of
enemies, is a standing miracle, and a
sufficient proof of her divinity. She
was assailed by the Jews, who crucified
her Lord and stirred up, wherever
they went, the hostility of the
people against his holy apostles and
missionaries; she was assailed by the
relentless persecution of the Roman
Empire, the strongest organization
the world has ever seen, and the
greatest political power of which history
gives any hint&mdash;an empire
which wielded the whole power of
organized paganism; she was driven
to the catacombs, and obliged to
offer up the holy sacrifice under the
earth, for there was no place for her
altars on its surface. Yet she survived
the empire; emerged from the catacombs
and planted the cross on the
Capitol of the pagan world. She
had then to encounter a hardly
less formidable enemy in the Arian
heresy, sustained by the civil power;
then came her struggle with the barbarian
invaders and conquerors from
the fifth to the tenth century&mdash;the
revolt of the East, or the Greek
schism; the great schism of the
West; the Northern revolt, or the so-called
Reformation of the sixteenth
century; and the hostility since of
the greatest and most powerful states
of the modern world; yet she stands
erect where she did nearly twenty
centuries ago, maintaining herself
against all opposition; against the
power, wealth, learning, and refinement
of this world; against Jew,
pagan, barbarian, heretic, and schismatic,
and preserving her identity
and her faith unchanged through all
the vicissitudes of the world in the
midst of which she is placed. She
never could have done it if she had
been sustained only by human virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
human wisdom, and human sagacity;
she could not have survived unchanged
if she had not been under
the divine protection, and upheld by
the arm of Almighty God. The
fact that she has lived on and preserved
her identity, especially if we
add to the opposition from without
the scandals that have occurred within,
is conclusive proof that under her
human form she lives a divine and
supernatural life; therefore that she is
the church of God, and is what she
affirms herself to be.</p>

<p>Believing the church to be what
she affirms herself to be; believing the
Roman Pontiff to be the successor of
Peter, the Vicar of Christ on earth,
the father and teacher of all Christians,
we have no fear that she will
not survive the persecution which
now rages against her, and that the
Pope will not see his enemies prostrate
at his feet. Through all history,
we have seen that the successes
of her enemies have been short-lived,
and the terrible losses they have occasioned
have been theirs, not hers.
It will always be so. Kings, emperors,
potentates, states, and empires may
destroy themselves by opposing her,
but her they cannot harm. See we
not how the wrongs done to the
Holy Father by Italian robbers,
obeying the dictates of the secret
societies, some of which, like the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Madre Natura</i>, date almost from apostolic
times, are quickening the faith
and fervor of Catholics throughout
the world? Not for centuries has
the Holy Father been so strong in
the love and devotion of his faithful
children as to-day. Never is the
church stronger or nearer a victory
than when abandoned by all the
powers of this world, and thrown back
on the support of her divine Spouse
alone.</p>

<h2>BORDEAUX.</h2>


<p>One of the first objects that strikes
the mariner ascending the Garonne
towards Bordeaux is the ancient tower
of St. Michel. I visited it the
very morning after my arrival in that
city. It is the belfry of a church of
the same name, but is separated from
it, being about forty yards distant.
It was built in 1472, and is two hundred
and fifty feet high. Formerly,
it was over three hundred feet in
height, but the steeple was blown
down by a hurricane on the 8th
of September, 1768. The view from
the top is superb. Before you, like
a map, lies the whole city&mdash;a noted
commercial centre from the time of
the Cæsars&mdash;encircling a great bend
of the river. The eye is at first confused
by the mass of roofs, spires, and
streets, but in a moment singles out
the great cruciform churches of St.
André, Ste. Croix, and St. Michel.
They lie beneath like immense
crosses with arms stretched out&mdash;a
perpetual appeal to heaven. Such
remembrances of Calvary must ever
stand between a sinful world and the
justice of Almighty God. How can
he look down upon all the iniquity
of a great city, and not feel the silent
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Parce nobis</i> of these sacred arms
extended over it, repeating silently,
as it were, the divine prayer, "Father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
forgive them, for they know not what
they do!" Oh! what a love for the
Passion dwelt in the heart of the
middle ages which built these churches.
Absorbed in the thought, I lost
sight of the city. Its activity, its
historical associations, the fine buildings
and extensive view, all disappear
before the cross. Bordeaux is
generally thought of only as a wine-mart,
but it also has holier associations.
"Every foot-path on this
planet may lead to the door of a
hero," it is said, and very few paths
there are in this Old World that do
not bring us upon the traces of the
saints&mdash;the most heroic of men, who
have triumphed over themselves,
which is better than the taking of a
strong city. They it was that made
these great signs of the cross on the
breast of this fair city, hallowing it
for ever.</p>

<p>Beneath the tower of St. Michel
is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caveau</i>, around which are ranged
ninety mummies in a state of preservation
said to be owing to the nature
of the soil. Why is it that every
one is enticed down to witness so
horrid a spectacle? Dust to dust
and ashes to ashes is far preferable
to these withered bodies, and a quiet
resting-place, deep, deep in the bosom
of mother earth till the resurrection.
Edmond About says the
twelfth century would have embroidered
many a charming legend to
throw around these bodies, but the
moderns have less imagination, and
the guardian of the tower, who displays
them by the light of his poor
candle, is totally deficient in poesy.
Had this writer been at Bordeaux
on the eve of All Souls' day, he would
have been invited at the midnight
hour, "when spirits have power," to
listen to the lugubrious cries and
chants that come up from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caveau</i>,
where, as the popular voice declares,
these ninety forms are having their
yearly dance&mdash;the dance of death!
I wonder if the mummy next the
door, as you gladly pass out into the
upper air, has his hand still extended
like an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>.... Yes, there
is one place where we shall meet,
but not in this repulsive form. May
we all be found there with glorified
bodies!</p>

<p>The church of St. Michel is older
than the tower, having been built in
the twelfth century. It is of the Gothic
style, and one of those antique
churches that speak so loudly to the
heart of the traveller from the New
World&mdash;one in which we are penetrated
with</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"An inward stillness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That perfect silence when the lips and heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are still, and we no longer entertain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our own imperfect thoughts and vain opinions,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God alone speaks in us, and we wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In singleness of heart that we may know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His will, and in the silence of our spirits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he may do his will, and do that only."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The ancients had a deep meaning
when they represented the veiled Isis
with her finger on her hushed lips.
The soul profoundly impressed by
the Divine Presence is speechless.</p>

<p>In one of the side chapels is the
tomb of an old bishop of the middle
ages, in a niche of the wall. On it
he lies carven in stone, with the mitre
on his head, and clad in his pontifical
vestments, and his hands folded
in prayer.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"Still praying in thy sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With lifted hands and face supine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet attitude of calm and reverence deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Keeping thy marble watch in hallowed shrine."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The cathedral of St. André is another
of these venerable monuments
of the past. Founded in the fourth
century, destroyed by the barbarians,
restored by Charlemagne, and again
ruined by the Normans, it was rebuilt
in the eleventh century, and
consecrated by Pope Urban II., in
1096. I went there at an early hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
to offer up my thanksgiving for the
happy end of this stage of my journey.
The canons were just chanting
the hours, which reverberated among
the light arches with fine effect.
Masses were being offered in various
chapels, and there were worshippers
everywhere. I was particularly struck
with the devout appearance of a venerable
old man in one of the dimmest
and most remote chapels, enveloped
in a hooded cloak, with the
capuche drawn over his head. He
looked as if his soul, as well as his
body, was almost done with time.</p>

<p>Through all these aisles and oratories,
which whispering lips filled
with the perfume of prayer streaming
through the old windows came
the morning sun,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Whose beams, thus hallowed by the scenes they pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell round the floor each parable of glass."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>I can still see the purple light filling
the chapel of the Sacred Heart
and ensanguining the uplifted Host.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"A sweet religious sadness, like a dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broods o'er this place. The clustered pillars high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are roséd o'er by the morning sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the heaven-hued windows far above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intense as adoration, warm as love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A purple glory deep is seen to lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn, poet, Christian, now the serious eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in white vests, a meek and holy band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chanting God's praise in solemn order, stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O hear that music swell far up and die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old temple, thy vast centuries seem but years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where wise and holy men lie glorified!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearts are full, our souls are occupied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And piety has birth in quiet tears!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>And all the worshippers in this
church were turned toward the holy
East, whence cometh the Son of
Man. The glory of the Lord came
into the house by the way of the
gate whose prospect is toward the
East. I like this orientation of
churches now too much neglected.
The old symbolic usages of the
church should be perpetuated. This
turning to the East in prayer was at
one age the mark of a true believer,
distinguishing him from those who
had separated from the church. True,
some of the old basilicas at Rome
and elsewhere have their altars at the
west, but, according to the ritual of
such churches, the priest turns toward
the people, thus looking to the East.
Cassiodorus and others say that our
Lord on the cross had his face toward
the west. So, in directing our
thoughts and hearts to Calvary, it is
almost instinctive to look to the East.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"With hands outstretched, bleeding and bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He doth in death his innocent head recline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turning to the west. Descending from his height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun beheld, and veiled him from the sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither, while from the serpent's wound we pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee, remembering that baptismal sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We turn and drink anew thy healing might."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Let us, then, place, as Wordsworth
says,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"Like men of elder days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Christian altar faithful to the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence the tall window drinks the morning rays."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>While I was lingering with peculiar
interest before a monument to
the memory of Cardinal de Cheverus,
the first Bishop of Boston, and
afterward Archbishop of Bordeaux,
whose memory is revered in the Old
World and the New, I heard a chanting
afar off, and, looking around, saw
through the open door a funeral procession
coming hastily along the
street toward the church, and singing
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</i>&mdash;coming, not with
mournful step and slow, as with us,
but like the followers of Islam, who
believe the soul is in torment between
death and burial, and so lay
aside their usual dignified deportment
and hurry the body to the grave.
But in France the funeral <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i>
does not necessarily include the
relatives, and I felt this very haste
might be typical of their eagerness to
commence the Office of the Dead.
Anyhow, I forgave them when, in the
chapel draped in black, I saw them
devoutly betake themselves to prayer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
during the Holy Sacrifice. I, too,
dropped my little bead of prayer for
the eternal rest of one whose name
I know not, but which is known to
God.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Help, Lord, the souls which thou hast made,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The souls to thee so dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In prison for the debt unpaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Of sins committed here."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The confessionals seemed to be
greatly frequented the day I was at
St. André's&mdash;those sepulchres into
which rolls the great burden of our
sins. There</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The great Absolver with relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands by the door, and bears the key,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er penitence on bended knee."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>What non-Catholic has not felt, at
least once in his life, as if he would
give worlds for the moral courage
to lay down the burden of memory at
the feet of some holy man endowed
with the power of absolving from sin!
Almighty God has made his church
the interpreter between himself and
his creatures; hence the peculiar grace
a holy confessor has to meet the
wants of the human heart laid bare
before him. Zoroaster told his disciples
that the wings of the soul, lost by
sin, might be regained by bedewing
them with the waters of life found
in the garden of God. It is only
the consecrated priest who has the
power of unsealing this fountain to
each one of us. These confessionals
are distributed in the various chapels,
everywhere meeting the eye of the
parched and sin-worn traveller who
would</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Kneel down, and take the word divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Absolvo te</span>."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Of course there is a Ladye Chapel
in this church, as in all others. Jesus
and Mary, whose names are ever
mingled on Catholic lips, the first they
learn and the last they murmur, are
never separated in our churches. Devotion
to the Virgin has grown up
through the church, beautifying and
perfuming it like the famous rose-bush
in the Cathedral of Hildesheim
in Germany&mdash;the oldest of all known
rose-bushes. It takes root under the
choir in the crypt. Its age is unknown,
but a document proves that
nearly a thousand years ago Bishop
Hezilo had it protected by a stone
roof still to be seen. So with devotion
to our Mystical Rose&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">quasi
plantatio rosæ in Jericho</i>&mdash;its roots
go down deep among the foundations
of the church; saints have protected
and nourished it, and all nations
come to sit under its vine and
inhale its perfume.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Blossom for ever, blossoming rod!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou didst not blossom once to die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That life which, issuing forth from God,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy life enkindled, runs not dry.<br /></span>

<span class="iq">"Without a root in sin-stained earth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No single soul the church brings forth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But blooms from thee, and is thy dower."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>What a safeguard to man is devotion
to Mary Most Pure! It is like
the Pridwin&mdash;the shield of King Arthur&mdash;on
which was emblazoned the
Holy Virgin, warding off the strokes
of the great enemy of souls.</p>

<p>There are some poetical associations
connected with Bordeaux:
among others, the memory of the
troubadours who enriched and perfected
the Romance tongue, but whose
songs at last died away in the sad
discord of the Albigensian wars.
Here the gay and beautiful Eleanor
of Aquitaine held her court of love,
gathering around her all the famous
troubadours of her time, and deciding
upon the merits of their songs.
Among these was her favorite, Bernard
de Ventadour, chiefly known
to fame by being mentioned by Petrarch.
Eleanor herself was a musician
and a lover of poetry&mdash;tastes
she inherited from her grandfather,
William, Duke of Aquitaine, generally
called the Count de Poitiers, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the earliest of the troubadours
whose songs have come down to us.
Around this charming queen of love
and song gathered the admiring votaries
of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">la gaia sciencia</i>, like nightingales
singing around the rose, all
vowing, as in duty bound, that
their hearts were bleeding on the
horns!</p>

<p>Poor maligned Eleanor was too
gay a butterfly for the gloomy court
of Louis VII. She wanted the bright
sun of her own province in which to
float, and the incense of admiring
voices to waft her along. She herself
was a composer of <i>chansons</i>, and
is reckoned among the authors of
France. She dearly loved Bordeaux,
her capital, and was adored by its
people. Here she was married with
great pomp to Louis, after which the
Duke of Aquitaine laid aside his insignia
of power, and, assuming the
garb of a hermit, went on a pilgrimage
to St. James of Compostella,
and devoted the remainder of his
life to prayer and penance in hermitage
on Montserrat, by way of preparation
for death. It is well to
pause awhile before plunging into
the great ocean of eternity.</p>

<p>These pilgrimages to Compostella
were exceedingly popular in that
age, and hospices for the pilgrims to
that shrine were to be found in all
the large cities and towns. There
was one at Auch, and another at Paris
in the Rue du Temple, which was
particularly celebrated and served
by Augustinian nuns. And here at
Bordeaux was the Hospice of St. André
for the reception of the weary
votary of St. Jago.</p>

<p>"Here comes a pilgrim," says one
of Shakespeare's characters. "God
save you, pilgrim. Where are you
bound?"</p>

<p>"To St. Jacques le Grand. Where
do the palmers lodge, I beseech
you?"</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Eftsoones unto an holy hospitall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was forby the way, she did him bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which seven bead-men that had vowed all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their life to service of high heaven's King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did spend their daies in doing godly thing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gates to all were open evermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That by the wearie way were travelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one sate wayting ever them before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To call in comers-by, that needy were and pore."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Digby says the hospitality and
charity of these hospices had their
origin in the bishops' houses. Fortunatus
thus speaks of Leontius II.,
Archbishop of Bordeaux, who, in accordance
with the apostle's injunction,
was given to hospitality:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Susceptor peregrum distribuendo cibum.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longius extremo si quis properasset ab orbe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advena mox vidit, hunc ait esse patrem."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That the devotion of the middle
ages is yet alive in the church is
proved by the influx of pilgrims at
the shrine of St. Germaine of Pibrac,
at Notre Dame de Lourdes, and a
thousand other places of popular devotion.
So great is the number of
pilgrims to Lourdes, drawn by the
brightness of Mary's radiant form,
that the railway between Tarbes and
Pau was turned from its intended direct
line in order to pass through
Lourdes. In one day the train from
Bayonne brought nine hundred, and
at another time over a thousand pilgrims.
And as for the continued
charity and hospitality of the church,
witness the monks of St. Bernard
and of Palestine, known to all the
world. How disinterested is genuine
Catholic charity, done unto the Lord
and not unto man! Some suppose
the good works practised among us
is by way of barter for heaven, but
they little know the spirit of the
church. Charity is one expression
of its piety, which, in its highest manifestations,
is devoid of self-interest.
Listen to John of Bordeaux, a holy
Franciscan friar, who, after quoting
a saying of Epictetus, that we generally
find piety where there is utility,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
says: "He does not come up to the
standard of pure Christianity: he
pretends that piety takes its birth in
utility, so that it is interest that gives
rise to devotion. Yes, among the
profane, but not among Christians,
who, acquainted with the maxims of
our holy religion, have no other end
but to serve God for his love and for
his glory; forgetting all considerations
of their own advantage, they
aspire to attain to that devotion
which is agreeable to him without
any view to their own interest."</p>

<p>And in these practical times another
holy writer, Dr. Newman, says
in the same spirit: "They who seek
religion for culture's sake, are æsthetic,
not religious, and will never gain
that grace which religion adds to
culture, because they can never have
the religion. To seek religion for
the present elevation, or even the social
improvement it brings, is really
to fall from faith which rests in God,
and the knowledge of him as the ultimate
good, and has no by-ends to
serve."</p>

<p>But to return to the romantic associations
of this land of the vine,
we recall the celebrated old romance
of Huon of Bordeaux, which contains
some delightful pictures of the
age of chivalry. Here is one which
I have abridged, showing how the
religious spirit was inwoven with the
impulses of the knightly heart. The
Emperor Thierry, furious because his
nephews and followers had been
slain by Huon, seized upon Esclarmonde
(Huon's wife) and her attendants,
and threw them into a dungeon,
there to await death. Huon,
greatly afflicted at this, disguised himself
as a pilgrim from the Holy Land,
and set out for Mayence, where the
emperor lived. He arrived on Maunday-Thursday,
and learned that it
was the custom of the emperor to
grant the petitions of him who first
presented himself after the office of
Good Friday morning. Huon was
so overjoyed at this information that
he could not sleep all that night, but
betook himself to his orisons, imploring
God to inspire and aid him so he
might again behold his wife. When
morning came, he took his pilgrim
staff and repaired to the chapel. As
soon as the office was ended, he contrived
to be the first to attract attention.
He told the emperor he was
there to avail himself of the custom
of the day in order to obtain a grace.
The emperor replied that, should he
even demand fourteen of his finest
cities, they would be given him, for
he would rather have one of his fists
cut off than recede from his oath;
therefore to make known his petition,
which would not be refused. Then
Huon requested pardon for himself
and for all of his who might have
committed some offence. The emperor
replied: "Pilgrim, doubt not
that what I have just promised, I
will fulfil, but I beg you right humbly
to tell me what manner of man
you are, and to what country and
race you belong, that you request
such grace from me." Huon then
made himself known. The emperor's
face blanched while listening to
him, and for a long time he was unable
to speak. At last he said: "Are
you, then, Huon of Bordeaux, from
whom I have received such ills&mdash;the
slayer of my nephews and followers?
I cannot cease wondering at your
boldness in presenting yourself before
me. I would rather have lost
four of my best cities, have had my
whole dominions laid waste and burned,
and I and my people banished
for three years, than find you thus
before me. But since you have thus
taken me by surprise, know in truth
that what I have promised and vowed
I will hold good, and, in honor
of the Passion of Jesus Christ, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the blessed day which now is, on
which he was crucified and dead, I
pardon you all hatred and evil-doing,
and God forbid that I should hold
your wife, or lands, or men, which I
will restore to your hands." Then
Huon threw himself on his knees,
beseeching the emperor to forgive
the injury he had done him. "God
pardon you," said the emperor. "As
for me, I forgive you with right good
will," and taking Huon by the hand,
he gave him the kiss of peace. Huon
then said: "May it please our Lord
Jesus Christ that this guerdon be returned
to you twofold." Then the
prisoners were released, and, after a
sumptuous entertainment, the emperor
accompanied Huon and his noble
lady on their way back to Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Bordeaux is interesting to the English
race, because, among other reasons,
it was for about three hundred
years a dependency of the English
crown, being the dowry of Eleanor of
Aquitaine, who married Henry II.
after her divorce from Louis le Jeune.
We associate the city, too, with Froissart
and the Black Prince, who held
his court here. Richard II. was born
hard by at the Château de Lormont.
And Henry III. came here to receive
his son's bride, Eleanor of Castile,
and gave her so extravagant a marriage
feast as to excite the remonstrances
of his nobles. The country
prospered under the English government.
The merchants had especial
privileges granted them by Eleanor,
and their wines then, as now, found
a ready market in London. Bordeaux
in particular increased wonderfully,
and outgrew its defensive
walls. The church of St. Michel
dates from the time of English domination,
and in that quarter of the
city may be seen old houses, one
story projecting beyond the other,
and the whole surmounted by a pyramidal
roof, said to be of English
origin, and such as are to be seen in
some of the oldest streets of London.</p>

<p>Eleanor always used her influence
for the benefit of her people. The
most ancient charter of privileges
granted the Gascon merchants was
given by her on the first of July,
1189.</p>

<p>The English seem to have taken
their war-cry from the old dukes of
Aquitaine who charged to the sound
of "St. George for the puissant
duke." A devotion to St. George
was brought from the East by the
Crusaders. Richard I. placed himself
and his army under the special
protection of this saint, who, the redoubted
slayer of the dragon and
the redresser of woman's wrongs, appealed
to the tenderest instincts of
the chivalric heart. St. George's remains
were brought from Asia by
the Crusaders, and a large part is
enshrined at Toulouse, in the great
basilica of St. Sernin. The crest of
the dukes of Aquitaine was a leopard,
which the kings of England bore for
a long time on their shields. Edward
III. is called a valiant pard in his
epitaph.</p>

<p>These old dukes of Aquitaine
seem always to have gone to extremes
either as sinners or saints.
Eleanor's grandfather, as I have said,
was one of the earliest of the troubadours.
He was distinguished for his
bravery, his musical voice, and his
manly beauty. His early life was
such as to incur the censure of the
bishop, but he ended his career in
penitence, and the last of his poems
is a farewell <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">á la chevalerie qu'il a
tant aimée</i> for the sake of the cross.
He was one of the first to join the
crusades at the head of sixty thousand
warriors, but he lost his troops
and gained neither glory nor renown.</p>

<p>The term Aquitaine was given this
country by Julius Cæsar on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of its numerous rivers and ports.
The ancient province of this name extended
from the Loire to the Pyrenees.
In the time of the Roman dominion,
Bordeaux was its capital under the
name of Burdigala. The origin of the
city is uncertain. Strabo, who lived
in the first century, mentions it as
a celebrated emporium. Some suppose
its first inhabitants to have been
of Iberian origin. The real history
of the city commences about the
middle of the third century, when Tetricus,
governor of Aquitaine, assumed
the purple and was proclaimed
emperor. About the same time St.
Martial preached in this region. But
the pagan divinities were still invoked
in the time of Ausonius. In the
annals of the Council of Arles, in 314,
Orientalis, Bishop of Bordeaux, is
mentioned.</p>

<p>The intellectual superiority of the
Romans was always even more potent
than the force of their arms.
Barbarism disappeared before the
splendor of their civilization. Burdigala
under their dominion felt the influence
of this superiority, and rose
to such a degree of magnificence and
luxury as to be a theme for Ausonius,
St. Jerome, and Sidonius Apollinaris.
The remains of buildings at Bordeaux
belonging to this epoch give an idea
of its prosperity and importance.
There is still an arena in ruins, commonly
called the Palais-Gallien, but
the most remarkable Roman monument
of the city was a temple called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Piliers de Tutelle</i>, which, partly ruined,
was demolished in 1677, by the order
of Louis XIV., for the construction
of a quay. Schools were established
at Bordeaux at an early day. We
learn from St. Jerome that in his time
the liberal arts were in the most flourishing
condition here. In the time
of the Roman dominion, there were
universities at Bordeaux, Auch, Toulouse,
Marseilles, Trèves, etc. The
edicts issued for their benefit showed
the importance attached to their
prosperity by the government. The
college of Bordeaux furnished professors
for Rome and Constantinople.
Valentinian I. chose Ausonius,
a native of Bordeaux, to superintend
the education of his son Gratian.
When the latter became emperor, he
made his old tutor a Roman consul
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 379). The poems of Ausonius
are still admired, but there is much
in them that is reprehensible. They
were translated into French by M.
Jaubert, a priest at Bordeaux, who
lived in the last century.</p>

<p>That the wines of Aquitaine were
already celebrated in the fourth century
is shown by the writings of Ausonius</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Ostrea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non laudata minus, nostri quam gloria vini."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>St. Paulinus, bishop of Nola, lived
at this time. He was born at Bordeaux
in the year 353, and was descended
from a long line of illustrious senators.
One of the several estates he
owned near the city still bears the
name of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Puy Paulin</i>, puy being a
word from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">langue Romaine</i>, perhaps
synonymous with the Latin
word podium. One of the public
squares of Bordeaux also bears the
same name. Paulinus possessed great
elevation of mind and a poetical genius,
which he cultivated under Ausonius,
for whose care he expresses his
gratitude in verse. But Ausonius
was magnanimous enough to acknowledge
that Paulinus excelled him as
a poet and that no modern Roman
could vie with him.</p>

<p>In his early life Paulinus held dignified
offices under government, but
his intercourse with St. Delphinus,
bishop of Bordeaux, inspired him
with a love for retirement, in which
his wife, a Spanish lady of wealth,
participated. They passed over into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Spain, and spent four years there in
the retirement of the country, but
not as anchorites. He seemed to
have given up all of life but its sweetness
when he composed the following
prayer: "O Supreme Master of
all things, grant my wishes, if they
are righteous. Let none of my days
be sad, and no anxiety trouble the
repose of my nights. Let the good
things of another never tempt me,
and may my own suffice to those
who ask my aid. Let joy dwell in
my house. Let the slave born on
my hearth enjoy the abundance of
my stores. May I live surrounded
by faithful servants, a cherished wife,
and the children she will bring me."</p>

<p>While in Spain they lost their only
son, whom they buried at Alcala,
near the bodies of the holy martyrs
Justus and Pastor. This loss weaned
them completely from the world.
Their Spanish solitude had been a
garden of roses, but now they chose
the lily as their emblem, and resolved
to lead a monastic life. Paulinus
received holy orders, and they both
sold all they possessed and gave the
money to the poor. This drew upon
Paulinus the contempt of the world.
Even his own relatives and former
slaves rose up against him, but to all
their invectives he only replied: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O
beata injuria displicere cum Christo</span>."
"O blessed scorn that is shared with
Christ." Ausonius, in particular, was
grieved to see the extensive patrimony
of Paulinus cut up among a hundred
possessors, and reproached him
in bitter terms for his madness. But
if the world rejected him, he was received
with open arms by such men
as St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, and St.
Augustine. His devotion to St. Felix,
whose tomb he had visited in his
childhood, induced him to fix his residence
near Nola in Campania.
Here he lived close by the church
where his favorite saint was enshrined.
He had put on the livery of
Christ's poor ones, and contented
himself with his cell and garden-plot.
And his meekness and sanctity, joined
to his talents as a writer, drew
upon him the admiration of the
world. Persons of the highest rank
from all parts went to see him in his
retreat, as St. Jerome and St. Augustine
testify. In his seclusion he writes
poems that have all the delicacy and
grace of Petrarch. He describes the
church of his loved saint, whose life
and miracles he is never weary of
dwelling on, as hung with white draperies
and gleaming with aromatic
lamps and tapers; the porch is wreathed
with fresh flowers, and the cloisters
strewn with blossoms; and pilgrims
come down from the mountains,
marching even at night by the
light of their torches, bringing their
children in sacks, and their sick on
litters, to be healed at the tomb; for
all the world, a picture of an Italian
shrine of these days.</p>

<p>He loved the humblest duties of
the sanctuary. "Suffer me to remain
at thy gates," he says. "Let me
cleanse thy courts every morning,
and watch every night for their protection.
Suffer me to end my days
amid the employments I love. We
take refuge within your hallowed pale
and make our nest in your bosom.
It is herein that we are cherished,
and expand into a better life. Casting
off the earthly burden, we feel
something divine springing up within
us, and the unfolding of the wings
which are to make us equal to the
angels." These words sound as if
coming from the cloistered votary of
the middle ages, or even of the nineteenth
century; the same is the spirit
of the church in all ages.</p>

<p>The writings of St. Paulinus show
his devotion to the saints and their
relics, a belief in the efficacy of
prayers for the dead, and in the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of the Real Presence. What
can be more explicit, for instance,
than these lines on the Holy Eucharist?</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"In cruce fixa caro est, quâ pascor; de cruce sanguis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ille fluit, vitam quo bibo, corda lavo."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>He adorned the walls of his church
with paintings and composed inscriptions
for the altar, under which were
deposited the relics of St. Andrew,
St. Luke, St. Nazarius, and others,
and sings thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"In regal shrines with purple marble graced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bones are 'neath illumined altars placed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pious band's contained in one small chest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That holds such mighty names within its tiny breast."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>After fifteen years of retirement,
St. Paulinus was made bishop of Nola.
Shortly before he died, as the
lamps were being lighted for the Vesper
service, he murmured,</p>

<p class="center">
"I have trimmed my lamp for Christ."<br />
</p>

<p>The prosperity of Bordeaux under
the Romans was interrupted by the
invasion of the barbarians that swept
down from the north, bringing ruin
and desolation to the land. For
nearly a century the city remained
in the power of the Visigoths, who,
being Arians, persecuted the Catholic
inhabitants. Sidonius Apollinaris
deplores the injury done to learning
by their invasion, but perhaps the
decline of learning was partly owing
to a growing distaste for pagan literature
among Christians. The barbarians
were finally routed by Clovis
in 507, and he took possession of
Bordeaux. Charlemagne made Aquitaine
a kingdom for his son Louis le
Débonnaire. Louis, son of Charles
le Chauve, was the last king of Aquitaine.
When he ascended the throne
of France, it resumed its former rank
as a duchy.</p>

<p>The college of Guienne was founded
here in the middle ages. In
the sixteenth century, it had, at one
time, twenty-five hundred pupils.
The famous George Buchanan, whom
everybody knows, because his head
adorns the cover of <cite>Blackwood's
Magazine</cite>, but who is more spoken
of than read, taught in this college
three years. He came here in 1539.
Among his pupils was the great Montaigne,
who passed most of his life at
Bordeaux and is buried in the church
of the Feuillants. As Buchanan was
somewhat given to hilarity and loved
the flavor of Gascon wines, this
city probably had its attractions for
him. In his <cite>Maiæ Calendæ</cite>, full of
gaiety and merry-making, he speaks
of the grapes of the sandy soil of
Gascony:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Nec tenebris claudat generosum cella Lyæum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quem dat arenoso Vasconis uva solo."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>One vintage season, Buchanan
went to Agen to enjoy it at the residence
of his friend, the celebrated
Julius Scaliger, who had been a professor
at the college of Guienne, but
was now settled as a physician at
Agen.</p>

<p>Among the other literary celebrities
of Bordeaux is Arnaud Berquin,
whose charming writings are still
popular. His <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ami des Enfants</i> was
crowned by the French Academy in
1784. And Montesquieu was born
at the château of La Brède near Bordeaux,
whence he took his title of
Baron de la Brède.</p>

<p>Bordeaux is now the finest city in
France after Paris, and it ranks next
to Lyons in importance. Perhaps
I cannot do better than quote what a
popular French author of the day
says of it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Bordeaux is five miles long and has
one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
plenty of room for few people.
But the entire population does not
breathe at its ease. If the grass be growing
in the streets and squares of the new
town, there is some stifling felt in the
old districts. The Jews, chapmen, brokers,
and marine store men live in a dirty
and unhealthy hive, and their shops form
no straight line along the narrow and unpaved
streets. You may still see a quantity
of those paunchy, hunchbacked, and
decrepit houses, which form the delight of
romantic archæology, and you need only
go to Bordeaux to form an accurate idea
of old Paris. In the new town all is
vast, rectilinear, and monumental: the
streets, squares, avenues, esplanades and
buildings rival the splendor of what we
are taught to admire in Paris. The
Grand Thèâtre, containing only twelve
hundred persons, has the imposing aspect
of a Colosseum and a staircase
which might be transferred with advantage
to our Opera. The cafés are truly
monuments, and I saw a bathing establishment
which bore a strong resemblance
to a necropolis. All this grandeur dates
from Louis XV. and Louis XVI. The
population of Bordeaux is one of the
prettiest specimens of the French nation.
The women possess more expression
than freshness, but with good hair, good
eyes, and white teeth, a woman cannot
but look well. The men have a sharp
look, a lively mind, and brilliancy of language."</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the glories of Bordeaux is
the bridge across the Garonne built
by order of Napoleon the Great. It
has seventeen arches, and there is an
interior gallery communicating from
one arch to another which is accessible.</p>

<p>There are some fine pictures in the
Musée des Tableaux&mdash;a Perugino,
and others by Titian, Vandyke, Rubens,
etc. Some excellent artists have
been formed in the School of Design,
among whom is Rosa Bonheur. But
the people in general are more fond
of music and the drama than the
other fine arts.</p>

<p>The commerce of Bordeaux is extensive,
but is surpassed by that of
Havre, perhaps because there is too
much of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">laisser-aller</i> in a more
southern temperament. Nevertheless,
the city is progressing. The
port, says the author already quoted,
is a third edition of the Thames at
London and the Golden Horn at
Constantinople.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF YORKE.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER III.<br />

DIEU DISPOSE.</h3>

<p>The early morning of Mr. Rowan's
burial had been heavy and
dark; but as they left the island a
shower of golden light broke through
the clouds, the water sparkled on all
sides, and the sighing air became a
frolic breeze. Dick and the captain
brightened, and exchanged a few
words in seamen's phrase complimenting
the weather. Mrs. Rowan
also roused herself, brushed the sand
from her clothes, arranged the folds
of her veil, and even smoothed her
hair. The poor creature's vanity
was dead, but at the prospect of
meeting strangers it gave a slight
post-mortem flicker. Out it went,
though, the next instant, on the
breath of a sigh. What did it matter
how she looked? But she glanced
anxiously at Edith.</p>

<p>The child had put on her mother's
red cape and drawn it up over her
head, and she still held it there, one
slim hand pulling the folds close together
under her chin. That she
might appear outlandish did not
trouble Edith. Indeed, she claimed
the right to be so on account of her
foreign blood. But when she noticed
Mrs. Rowan's attention to her own
toilet, and met her glance, she
pushed the cape off her head, and,
putting her arms up, began to
smooth her hair and plait it into
a long braid. It was rich, long hair,
not given to wilful ringlets, but
would curl when in the mood. Now
the wind blew little curls out about
her face, and the risen sun steeped
the tresses in a pale flame.</p>

<p>The braid finished, she tossed it
back, and caught it lightly into a
loop, the motion revealing a pair of
round white arms, to which the
hands and wrists looked like colored
gauntlets. Then she unfolded her
precious Indian relic of tarnished red
and gold, and bound it straightly
about her head, half-covering the
forehead, so that the long, fringed
ends hung behind, and a loose fold
fell over each ear.</p>

<p>Beholding her in that guise, Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Cary thought that she looked
fitter for some oriental scene than for
this crude corner of a crude land.
"She might be a stolen child stained
with gypsy-wort," he said to himself.</p>

<p>But she was Gypsy only in color.
No wild fires burned in her face;
her cool eyes looked out calm and
observant; her mouth was gently
closed. The very shape of her features
expressed tranquillity.</p>

<p>The sailor found himself much interested
in this little girl. Besides
that her appearance pleased him,
his good-will had been bespoken;
for on one of those days when their
ship had lain becalmed in southern
waters, Dick had told him all her
story. Listening to it, half-asleep, as
to something that might be fact and
might be fancy, all the scene about
him had entwined itself with the history
and with the heroine's character.
The solid golden day, shut
down over a sea whose soft pulses
told of perfect repose; the wide-eyed,
radiant night, which seemed every
moment on the point of breaking
into music far and near, a fine, clear
music of countless sweet bells with
almost human tongues&mdash;they formed
the background on which her image
floated. Seeing her did not dispel
but rather strengthened the illusion.
Something golden in her hair, something
tranquil in her face, something
expectant in her eyes&mdash;all
were like.</p>

<p>The rough giant of a sailor mused
tenderly over this as he sent their
boat forward with powerful strokes,
and watched Edith Yorke bind on
her Egyptian <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coiffure</i>.</p>

<p>They did not row to the wharf,
where the steamer had already arrived,
but to a place a few rods
above, where the sea had taken a
good semicircular bite out of the
land. Here a straggling bit of dilapidated
woods had been allowed
to remain by the vandals who had
turned all the rest to grass and pasture,
and a mossy ledge broke the
teeth of the soft, gnawing waves.</p>

<p>Edith stepped lightly on shore.
She was young, healthy, brave, and
ignorant, and pain, though it called
forth her tears, was stimulating to
her. That pang had not yet come
which could cut her heart in twain
and let all the courage out.</p>

<p>"You are spry," Captain Cary
said, smiling down upon her.</p>

<p>She smiled faintly in return, but
said nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan needed assistance at
either hand. She had been broken
by pain.</p>

<p>They stood awhile in the grove,
Dick and the captain making some
business arrangements. The <i>Halcyon</i>
was to remain four weeks at
Seaton, and it was agreed that Dick
should have that time to get his
mother settled. Then the ship would
touch at New York, where he would
embark for the East again.</p>

<p>While they lingered, a large yellow
coach, loaded with passengers,
rattled past amid clouds of dust.</p>

<p>"There is no hurry," Dick said.
"It will take an hour to get the
freight off and on. But you needn't
wait, captain. They'll be looking
for you at the village."</p>

<p>The others drew near to Captain
Cary at that, holding his hands and
trying to utter their thanks.</p>

<p>"Oh! it's nothing," he said, much
abashed. "I haven't done anything
to be thanked for. Good-by! Keep
up your courage, and you will come
out first-rate. There's nothing like
grit."</p>

<p>A subsiding ripple tossed his boat
against the shore. At that hint he
stepped in, dallied with the rope,
then said, with a perfectly transparent
affectation of having only just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
thought of it: "Oh! I've got a ring
here that Edith is welcome to, if she
will wear it. I brought it home for
my niece; but the child is dead. It
won't fit anybody else I know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan immediately thanked
him, and Edith smiled with childish
pleasure. "You are very kind, Captain
Cary," she said. "I always
thought I would like to have a
ring."</p>

<p>Dick alone darkened; but no one
noticed it. He had meant to do
everything for her; and here was a
wish which she had never expressed
to him, and he had not known
enough to anticipate.</p>

<p>The captain drew a tiny box from
his pocket, and displayed a small
circlet in which was set a single
spark of diamond. Edith extended
her left hand, and the sailor, leaning
over the boatside, slipped the ring
on to her forefinger.</p>

<p>"Good-by, again!" he said then
hastily, and gave each of them a
grasp of the hand. Dick could take
care of himself; but the other two,
putting out their tender hands impulsively,
grew red in the face with
pain at the grip of his iron fingers.
The next instant his boat shot out
into the bay. They looked after him
till he glanced back and saluted them
with a nod, and two arches of spray
tossed from his oars; then turned
and climbed the shore, Dick assisting
his mother, Edith following.</p>

<p>"Good-by, trees!" said the child,
glancing up. "Good-by, moss!"
stooping to gather a silken green
flake and a cluster of red-topped
gray. The prettiest cup had a spider
in it, and she would not disturb it.
"Good-by, spider!" she whispered,
"I'm never coming back again."</p>

<p>She had friends to take leave of,
after all&mdash;not human friends, but
God's little creatures, who had never
hurt her save in self-defence.</p>

<p>When they reached the wharf, there
was no one in sight but the men who
trundled the freight off and on. At
the upper end of the wharf there was
a small building used as office and
waiting-room. The passage to the
boat being obstructed, Dick sent his
mother and Edith there, while he
went on board to get tickets. They
went to the door of the waiting-room,
hesitated a moment on seeing it
occupied, then went in, and seated
themselves in a retired corner.</p>

<p>The party who were already in
possession glanced at the new-comers,
and immediately became
oblivious of them. This party were
evidently the members of one family.
Some indefinable resemblance, as
well as their air of intimacy, showed
that. An elderly gentleman walked
up and down the floor, his hands
clasped behind his back, and a lady
not much over forty sat near, surrounded
by her three daughters. At
a window, to which the mother's
back was turned, looking up toward
the village, stood a young man
whose age could not be over twenty-three.
The ages of the daughters
might vary from sixteen to twenty.
They formed rather a remarkable
group, and were attractive, though
the faces of all expressed more or
less dissatisfaction. That of the
young man indicated profound disgust.
The elder lady had a sweet
and melancholy expression, and appeared
like an invalid. The youngest
daughter, who sat beside her, was
as like her mother as the waxing
moon is like the waning. She was
pretty, had clinging, caressing ways,
a faint dimple in her left cheek,
splendid auburn hair, and gray eyes.
They called her Hester. On the
other hand sat the eldest daughter, a
rather stately, self-satisfied young
woman, whose attentions to her
mother had an air of patronage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
This was Melicent. She was rather
fair, neutral in color, and excessively
near-sighted. The second daughter
stood behind her mother, and was
very attentive to her, but in an absent
way, often doing more harm
than good by her assistance. "My
dear Clara, you are bundling the
shawl all about my neck! My love,
you pull my bonnet off in arranging
my veil! Why, Clara, what are you
doing to my scarf?" Such remarks
as these were constantly being addressed
to her. Clara was a dark
brunette, with small features, a superb
but not tall figure, and large
gray eyes that looked black. Her
coal-black hair grew rather low on
the forehead, straight black brows
overshadowed her eyes and nearly
met over the nose, and an exquisitely
delicate mouth gave softness to this
face which would otherwise have
been severe. She seemed to be a
girl of immense but undisciplined
energy, and full of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The gentleman who paced the
floor was slightly under-sized and
thin in figure, thin in face, too, dark,
and sallow. The very look of him
suggested bile and sarcasm. But
let him speak for himself, since he is
just now on this subject. "Bile, my
dear," he said to his wife&mdash;"bile
came into the world with original
sin. I am not sure that bile is not
sin. It is Marah in a pleasant land.
It is a fountain of gall in the garden
of paradise. It poisons life. Doctors
know nothing whatever about
bile, and liver-medicines are a superstition.
He who shall discover a
way to eradicate bile from the system
will be a great moral reformer.
Every sin I ever committed in my
life took its rise in my liver. I believe
the liver to be an interpolation
in the original man. We should be
better without it."</p>

<p>The gentleman who spoke had a
wide, thin mouth, very much drawn
down at the corners and nowise
hidden, the gray moustache he
spared in shaving being curled up
at the ends. His manner was that
of a person who would scarcely
brook contradiction. His speech
was clear and emphatic, and he pronounced
his words as if he knew
how they were spelt. A long, delicate
aquiline nose had a good deal
to do with his profile, as had also a
pair of overhanging eyebrows. From
beneath these brows looked forth a
pair of keen gray eyes, with countless
complex wrinkles about them.
The chin was handsome, well-rounded,
and, fortunately, not projecting.
A projecting chin with an
aquiline nose is one of the greatest
of facial misfortunes. Caricature can
do no more. The forehead was intellectual,
and weighty enough to
make it no wonder if the slight frame
grew nervous and irritable in carrying
out the behests of the brain hidden
there. The head was crowned
by a not inartistic confusion of gray
hair which seemed to have been
stirred by electricity.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, madam, that I cannot
compliment the climate of your
native state," he remarked after a
pause. "The spring is a month or
six weeks behind that of Massachusetts,
and the fall as much earlier.
The travelling here is simply intolerable.
It is either clouds of dust,
bogs of mud, or drifts of snow. I
quite agree with the person who said
that Maine is a good state to come
<em>from</em>."</p>

<p>"We all know, Charles, that the
climate of Massachusetts, and particularly
of Boston, surpasses that of
any other part of the world," the
lady replied with great composure.</p>

<p>The gentleman winced very slightly.
He was one of those who constantly
make sarcastic observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to others, but are peculiarly sensitive
when such are addressed to themselves.
In his society, one was frequently
reminded of the little boy's
complaint: "Mother, make Tommy
be still. He keeps crying every
time I strike him on the head with
the hammer."</p>

<p>"Here will be a chance to practise
your famous English walks, Melicent,"
the father said. "I presume
the old chaise is dissolved. I remember
it twenty years ago nodding
along the road in the most polite
manner. By the way, Amy, did you
ever observe that in genuine country
places people leave their defunct vehicles
to decay by the roadside? I
am not sure that there is no poetry
in the custom. The weary wheels
crumble to dust in view of the track
over which they have rolled in life,
and are a <i>memento mori</i> to living carriages.
It is not unlike the monument
of Themistocles 'on the watery
strand.'"</p>

<p>"Papa," exclaimed Hester, "why
didn't you say tired wheels? You
started to."</p>

<p>"Because I detest a pun."</p>

<p>Melicent, who had been waiting
for a chance, now spoke. "You
don't mean to say, papa, that we
shall have no carriage?"</p>

<p>A shrug of the shoulders was the
only reply.</p>

<p>The young woman's face wore a
look of dismay. "But, papa!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Wait till the pumpkins grow," he
said with a mocking smile. "I will
give you the largest one, and your
mother will furnish the mice. I don't
doubt there are mice, and to spare."</p>

<p>"You don't mean that we must
walk everywhere?" his daughter
cried.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Melicent, how persistent
you are!" interrupted Clara impatiently.
"One would think there
was no need of borrowing trouble."</p>

<p>The elder sister gazed with an air
of superiority at the younger. "I
was speaking to papa," she remarked
with dignity.</p>

<p>The father frowned, the mother
raised a deprecating hand, and the
imminent retort was hushed. Clara
went to her brother, and, leaning on
his arm, whispered that, if Mel were
not her own sister, she should really
get to dislike her.</p>

<p>"How silent you are, Owen," said
Hester, looking around at him. "All
you have done to entertain us so far
has been to make faces when you
were sick. To be sure, that made us
laugh."</p>

<p>"A sea-sick person may be the
cause of wit in others, but is seldom
himself witty," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>The speaker was a slim, elegant
youth, with golden tints in his light
hair, with rather drooping and very
bright blue eyes, and a beautiful, sensuous
mouth.</p>

<p>Edith Yorke watched this party
with interest, and the longer she
looked at the elder gentleman the
better she liked him. His manner
of addressing the ladies suited her
inborn sense of what a gentleman's
manner should be. There was no
contemptuous waiting before answering
them, no flinging the reply over
his shoulder, nor growling it out like
a bear. Besides, she half-believed&mdash;only
half, for her eyes were heavy
with weeping and loss of sleep&mdash;that
he had looked kindly at her. Once
she was sure that he spoke of her to
his wife, but she did not know what
he said. It was this: "My dear, do
you observe that child? She has an
uncommon face."</p>

<p>The lady glanced across the room
and nodded. She was too much preoccupied
to think of anything but
their own affairs. But her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
on whom these affairs had the contrary
effect of driving him to seek
distraction, approached Edith.</p>

<p>"Little girl," he said, "you remind
me so much of some one I have seen
that I would like to know your name,
if you please to tell it."</p>

<p>"My name is Edith Eugénie
Yorke," she replied, with perfect
self-possession.</p>

<p>He had bent slightly toward her
in speaking, but at sound of the
name he stood suddenly upright,
his sallow face turned very red, and
he looked at her with a gaze so
piercing that she shrank from it.
"Who were your father and mother?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"My mother was Eugénie Lubormirski,
a Polish exile, and my father
was Mr. Robert Yorke, of Boston,"
said Edith. Her eyes were fixed intently
on the gentleman's face, and
her heart began to beat quickly.</p>

<p>He turned away from her and resumed
his walk, but, after a minute,
came back again. "Your father and
mother are both dead?" he asked in
a gentler tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You have no brothers nor sisters?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Who takes care of you?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jane Rowan," Edith replied,
laying her hand on the widow's
lap.</p>

<p>He bowed, taking this for an introduction,
a cold but courteous
bow.</p>

<p>"May I ask, madam," he inquired,
"what claim you have on this
child?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan had shown some agitation
while this conversation was
going on, and when Edith put out
her hand, she grasped it as if meaning
to hold on to the child. Her
reply was made in a somewhat defiant
tone. "When Mrs. Robert
Yorke died, she asked me to have
pity on her daughter, and keep her
out of the poor-house. I have taken
care of her ever since. The Yorkes
had turned them off."</p>

<p>The gentleman drew himself up,
and put out his under lip. "Thank
you for the information," he said
bitterly. Then to Edith, "Come,
child," and took her hand.</p>

<p>She allowed him to lead her across
the room to his wife.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Yorke," he said, "this is my
brother Robert's orphan child!"</p>

<p>There was a slight sensation and a
momentary pause; but the lady recovered
immediately. "I am glad
to see you, dear," she said in a kind
voice. "Who is that person?" she
added to her husband, glancing at
Mrs. Rowan.</p>

<p>The widow was staring at them
angrily, and seemed on the point
of coming to take Edith away by
force.</p>

<p>"One who has taken care of the
child since her mother's death, Amy,"
he answered. "She has no claim on
my niece, and will, of course, give
her up to us. The little girl is named
for my mother. Robert was always
fond of mother."</p>

<p>There was a pause of embarrassed
silence.</p>

<p>"You must perceive that there is
no other way," Mr. Yorke continued
with some state. "Aside from natural
affection and pity for the child's
friendless condition, an Edith Yorke
must not be allowed to go about the
country like a Gypsy with a shawl
over her head."</p>

<p>"It is just as papa says," Melicent
interposed, and immediately
took Edith by the hand and kissed
her cheek. "You are my little cousin,
and you will go home and live
with us," she said sweetly.</p>

<p>Miss Yorke's manner was very conciliating;
but her suavity proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
less from real sweetness than from self-complacency.
She prided herself on
knowing and always doing what was
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comme il faut</i>, and took great pleasure
in being the mould of form.</p>

<p>"I shall go with Dick! I am going
to live with Dick!" Edith cried,
snatching her hand away. A blush
of alarm overspread her face, and
she looked round in search of her
protector. At that moment he appeared
in the door, paused in surprise
at seeing where Edith was, then
went to his mother.</p>

<p>"The Yorkes have got her," Mrs.
Rowan said to him, breathless with
excitement. "That is Mr. Charles
Yorke. I knew him the moment I
set eyes on him."</p>

<p>Dick wheeled about and faced
them. Edith, too proud to run
away, looked at him imploringly.</p>

<p>Then Miss Melicent Yorke arose,
like the goddess of peace, adjusted
her most impregnable smile, and
sailed across the room. "I am
Miss Yorke," she said brightly, as
though such an announcement would
be sure to delight them. "Of
course, the dear little Edith is my
cousin. Is it not the strangest thing
in the world that we should have met
in such a way? I am sure we shall
all feel deeply indebted to you for
having protected the child while we
knew nothing of her necessities. Of
course, we should have sent for
her directly if we had known. But,
as it is, we have the pleasure of meeting
you."</p>

<p>Pausing, Miss Yorke looked at the
two as if they were the dearest friends
she had on earth and it gave her heartfelt
joy to behold their countenances.</p>

<p>Dick choked with the words he
would have uttered. He felt keenly
the insolence of her perfectly confident
and smiling address, yet knew
not how to defend himself. If a man
had been in her place, he could have
met his airy assumption with a sufficiently
blunt rebuff; but the young
sailor was chivalric, and could not
look a woman in the face and utter
rude words. His mother's emotion
did not prevent her replying, and,
fortunately, to the point.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," Mrs. Rowan
exclaimed, "that you are going
to take Edith away from us without
leave or license, after we have supported
her four years without your
troubling yourselves whether she
starved in the street or not?"</p>

<p>For a moment, Miss Yorke's social
poniard wavered before this broad
thrust, but only for a moment.
"Every family has its own private
affairs, which no one else has either
the power or the right to decide
upon," she said smilingly. "All I
need say of ours is that, if Mr. Yorke,
my father, had known that his brother
left a child unprovided for, he would
have adopted her without delay. He
did not know it till this minute, and
his first thought is that there is only
one proper course for him. His niece
must be under his care, as her natural
protector, and must have the advantages
of education and society to
which she is entitled. I am sure
you would both be friendly enough
to her to wish her to occupy her
rightful position. As for any expense
you may have gone to on
her account, papa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop there, madam!" Dick interrupted
haughtily. "We will say no
more about that, if you please. As
to Edith's going with you, she shall
choose for herself. I don't deny that
it seems to be the proper thing; but
allow me to say that it was my intention
to give her a good home and a
good education, such as no girl need
be ashamed of. I will speak to Edith,
and see what she thinks about it."</p>

<p>He turned unceremoniously away
from Miss Yorke's protestations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
went to the door, beckoning Edith to
follow him. As he looked back, waiting
for her, he saw that the whole
family had gone over in a body to
talk to his mother.</p>

<p>Edith clasped the hand he held
out to her, and looked up into his
face with large tears flashing in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't leave you if they
would give me all the world!" she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>He smiled involuntarily, but would
not take advantage of her affectionate
impulse. He saw clearly that
her true place was with her relatives.
They could do for her at once what
he could do only after years of weary
labor. Perhaps they could do at once
what he could never do. But it was
hard to give her up. Down in the
bottom of his heart was a thought
which he had never fully acknowledged
the presence of, but of which
he was always conscious: he had
meant to bring the child up to be
his wife some day, if she should be
willing; to load her with benefits; to
be the one to whom she should owe
everything. But with the pang it
cost him to put this hope in peril
came the glimpse of a possibility how
far more triumphant! Following his
own plan, he should be hedging her
in; giving her up now would be making
her free choice, if it should fall on
him, an infinitely greater boon. Besides,
and above all, it was right that
she should go.</p>

<p>Dick leaned back against the wall
of the building, and folded his arms
while he talked to her. At first Edith
broke into reproaches when she learned
that he meant to give her up, but
immediately an instinct of feminine
pride and delicacy checked the words
upon her lips. It was impossible for
her to press her society on one who
voluntarily relinquished it. She listened
to her sentence in silence.</p>

<p>"So you see, Edith," he concluded,
"we must make up our minds to
part."</p>

<p>She perceived no such necessity,
but did not tell him so. "Then I
shall never see you any more!" she
said in a whisper, without looking
up.</p>

<p>Dick's eyes sparkled with resolution
through the tears that filled them.
"Yes, you will!" he exclaimed. "I
mean to do the best I can for
mother and myself, and you shall not
be ashamed of us. And however
high they may set you, Edith, I'll
climb! I'll climb! I won't be so
far off but I can reach you!"</p>

<p>The coach had taken its first load
of passengers to the village, and now
came down to bring those who were to
take the steamer and carry the Yorkes
back. It was time to go on board.
Dick stepped to the door of the waiting-room.
"Come, mother!" he
said. "Edith and I will see you to
your state-room, and then I will bring
her back. She is to go with her uncle."</p>

<p>He was not surprised to see that
his mother had been completely talked
over by Edith's relations, and
that, though tearful, no opposition was
to be expected from her. They seemed
to be the best of friends; and
when the widow rose to take leave
of them, Mr. Yorke himself escorted
her to the boat. In fact, it was
all very comfortably settled, as Miss
Yorke observed to her mother when
they had taken their seats in the
coach.</p>

<p>When Edith and Dick appeared
again, hand in hand, Mr. Yorke stood
at the coach-door, waiting to assist
his niece to her place.</p>

<p>"How picturesque!" Clara Yorke
exclaimed, as the two stepped over
the planks and came toward them.
"It is like something out of the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite>. He is Sindbad, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
is one of those princesses who were
always getting into such ridiculous
situations and difficulties. The child
is absurd, of course, but she is lovely;
and the young man is really very
fine&mdash;of his kind."</p>

<p>Sindbad and his princess were both
very pale. "Sir," the sailor said,
presenting the child to her uncle, "I
hope she will be as happy with you
as I and my mother would have tried
to make her."</p>

<p>As he released her hand, Edith's
face suddenly whitened. All her little
world was slipping away from beneath
her feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke was touched and impressed.
He liked the young man's
dignity. "I must compliment you,
sir, on your honorable conduct in this
affair," he said. "Let us hear from
you; and come to see us whenever
you are in our neighborhood."</p>

<p>Dick Rowan, in his turn, would
have been touched by this unexpected
cordiality, had not a slight raising
of Miss Melicent Yorke's eyebrows
neutralized its effect. The young
woman thought that her father was
really condescending unnecessarily.
That faint, supercilious surprise checked
the young man's gratitude, and he
was turning away with a cold word
of thanks, when Mrs. Yorke called
him back. She was leaning from the
carriage, and held out her hand to
him.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Rowan!" she said
aloud. "You need not fear that we
shall not cherish this orphan whom
you have kindly protected so far, and
you need not fear that we shall try
to make her forget you. Ingratitude
is the vice of slaves. I am sure she
will never be ungrateful to you."</p>

<p>"Thank you!" Dick said fervently,
melted by the kind smile and
tremulous sweetness of tone. It was
none of Miss Melicent's exasperating
affability.</p>

<p>"And I have a favor to ask," she
added, leaning still further out, and
lowering her voice so that only he
could hear. "I take for granted that
you will write to my niece. Will you
allow her to let me read your letters?"</p>

<p>Dick blushed deeply as he stammered
out another "Thank you!"
It was a delicately given warning
and kindly given permission. It
showed him, moreover, that the lady's
soft eyes had looked to the bottom
of his heart. At that moment
he was glad that the ring on Edith's
finger was Captain Cary's gift, not
his.</p>

<p>"I would like to see the steamboat
just as long as it is in sight,"
Edith said faintly.</p>

<p>Her uncle immediately gave orders
to the driver to take them round
to a place from which they could
look down to the entrance of the
bay.</p>

<p>The boat steamed out over the
water, glided like a swan down the
bay, and soon disappeared around a
curve that led to the Narrows.
Edith gazed immovably after it, unconscious
that they were all watching
her. When it was no longer visible,
she closed her eyes, and sank
back into Mrs. Yorke's arms.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IV.<br />

THE OLD HOME.</h3>

<p>Mrs. Charles Yorke was a native
of Seaton; her maiden name, Arnold.
Her mother had died while Amy was
quite young, and in a few years the
father married again. This marriage
was an unfortunate one for the family;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
and not only the daughter but
many of Mr. Arnold's friends had
tried to dissuade him from it. Their
chief argument was not that the person
whom he proposed to marry was
a vulgar woman whom his lost wife
would not have received as an acquaintance,
but that she was in every
way unworthy of him, and would be
a discreditable connection. They
met the fate which usually awaits
such interference. Truth itself never
appears so true as varnished falsehood
does. Mr. Arnold was flattered
and duped; and the end of the affair
was that Amy had the misery of
seeing his deceiver walk triumphantly
into her mother's sacred place.
Nor was this all. In a moment of
weakness, the father betrayed to his
new wife the efforts that had been
made to separate them, and she half-guessed,
half-drew from him every
name. From that moment her instinctive
jealous dislike of her step-daughter
was turned to hatred.</p>

<p>Had the young girl been wise, she
would have known that her only proper
course was to withdraw from the
field; but she was inexperienced and
passionate, and had no better adviser
than her own heart. Had she been
a Catholic, she could have found in
the confessional the confidant and
counsel she needed; but she was
not. In Seaton there were no Catholics
above the class of servants
and day-laborers. She was left,
therefore, completely to herself, and
in the power of an unscrupulous and
subtle tormentor. Miserable, indignant,
and desperate, the young girl
descended to the contest, and at
every step she was defeated. She
called on her father for protection;
but he saw nothing of her trials, or
was made to believe that she had
herself provoked them. It was the
old story of adroit deceit arrayed
against impolitic sincerity. But, happily,
the contest was not of long duration.</p>

<p>Amy was not a person to remain
in a position so false and degrading.
There came a time when, quite as
much to her own surprise as to theirs,
she had nothing more to say. But
their surprise was that she contended
no longer, hers that she had contended
so long. The way was clear
before her, and her plans were soon
made. Her father had an unmarried
cousin living in Boston, and this lady
consented to receive her. Only on
the day preceding her departure did
she announce her intentions. The
sufferings she had undergone were a
sufficient excuse for her abruptness.
She had become too much weakened
and excited to bear any controversy
upon the subject. Besides, the parting
from her father, if prolonged,
would have been unbearable. She
must tear herself away.</p>

<p>He sat a moment with downcast
eyes after she had communicated to
him her design. His face expressed
emotion. He seemed both pained
and embarrassed, and quite at a loss
what to say. In fact, his wife had
proposed this very plan, and was
anxious that Amy should go, and he
had entertained the project. Therefore
he could not express surprise.
For the first time, perhaps, a feeling
of shame overcame him. He was
obliged to deceive! His pride, revolting
at that shame, made him impatient.
Unwilling to acknowledge
himself in the wrong, he wished to
appear injured.</p>

<p>"If you mean to deprive me of
my only child, and would rather live
with strangers than with your own
father, I will not oppose you," he
said. "But I think you might have
shown some confidence in me, and
told me your wishes before."</p>

<p>Amy's impulse had been, at the
first sight of his emotion, to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
herself into his arms, and forgive
him everything, or take upon herself
all the blame. But at these words
she recoiled. Her silence was better
than any answer could have been.</p>

<p>"I don't blame you, child," her
father resumed, blushing for the evasion
he had practised. "It would
be cruel of me to wish you to stay
in a home where you cannot live in
peace. I am grieved, Amy, but I
can do nothing. What can a man
do between women who disagree?"</p>

<p>"Find out which is wrong!" was
the answer that rose to her lips, but
she suppressed it. She had already
exhausted words to him. She had
poured out her pain, her love, her
entreaties, and they had been to him
as the idle wind. She had been
wronged and insulted, and he would
not see it. She turned away with a
feeling of despair.</p>

<p>"At least, let us part as a father
and daughter should," he said in a
trembling voice.</p>

<p>She held out one hand to him,
and with the other covered her face,
unable to utter a word; then broke
away, and shut herself into her chamber.
There are times when entire
reparation only is tolerable, and we
demand full justice, or none.</p>

<p>So they parted, and never met
again, though they corresponded regularly,
and wrote kind if not confidential
letters. The only sign the
daughter ever had of any change of
opinion in her father regarding the
cause of their separation was when
he requested her to send her letters
to his office and not to the house.
After that they both wrote more
freely.</p>

<p>In her new home, Amy did not
find all sunshine. Miss Clinton was
old and notional, and had too great
a fondness for thinking for others as
well as herself. Consequently, when
the young lady favored the addresses
of a poor artist who had been employed
to paint her portrait, there
was an explosion. With her father's
consent, Amy married Carl Owen,
and her cousin discarded her. There
was one year of happiness; then the
young husband died, and left his
wife with an infant son.</p>

<p>In her trouble, Mrs. Owen made
the acquaintance of Mrs. Edith
Yorke, who became to her a helpful
friend; and in little more than a
year she married that lady's eldest
son, Charles. From that moment
her happiness was assured. She found
herself surrounded by thoroughly
congenial society, and blest with the
companionship of one who was to
her father, husband, and brother, all
she had ever lost or longed for. Mr.
Yorke adopted her son as his own,
and, so far from showing any jealousy
of his predecessor, was the one
to propose that the boy should retain
his own father's name in addition to
the one he adopted.</p>

<p>As daughters grew up around them,
he appeared to forget that Carl was
not his own son, at least so far as
pride in him went. Probably he
showed more fondness for his girls.</p>

<p>Mr. Arnold died shortly after his
daughter's second marriage, and his
wife followed him in a few years. By
their death Mrs. Yorke became the
owner of her old home. But she
had no desire to revisit the scene of
so much misery, and for years the
house was left untenanted in the care
of a keeper. Nor would they ever
have gone there, probably, but for
pecuniary losses which made them
glad of any refuge.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Yorke appreciated the
value of money, and knew admirably
well how to spend it; but the
acuteness which can foresee and make
bargains, and the unscrupulousness
which is so often necessary to insure
their success, he had not. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
when in an evil hour he embarked
his inherited wealth in speculation,
it was nearly all swept away.</p>

<p>Creditors, knowing his probity, offered
to wait.</p>

<p>"Why should I wait?" he asked.
"Will my debts contract as the cold
weather comes on? I prefer an immediate
settlement."</p>

<p>Not displeased at his refusal to
profit by their generosity, they hinted
at a willingness to take a percentage
on their claims.</p>

<p>"A percentage!" cried the debtor.
"Am I a swindler? Am I a beggar?
I shall pay a hundred per cent., and
I recommend you in your future dealings
with me to bear in mind that I
am a gentleman and not an adventurer."</p>

<p>A very old-fashioned man was Mr.
Charles Yorke, and a very hard man
to pity.</p>

<p>Behold him, then, and his family
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for their new home.</p>

<p>We have said that the two principal
streets of the town of Seaton
crossed each other at right angles,
one running north and south along
the river, the other running east and
west across the river. These roads
carried themselves very straightly before
folks, but once out of town,
forgot their company manners, and
meandered as they chose, splintered
into side-tracks, and wandered off in
vagabond ways. But the south road,
that passed by the Rowans', was the
only one that came to nothing. The
other three persisted till they each
found a village or a city, twenty-five
miles or so away. Half a mile from
the village centre, on North Street, a
very respectable-looking road started
off eastward, ran across a field, and
plunged into the forest that swept
down over a long smooth rise from
far-away regions of wildness. Following
this road half a mile, one saw
at the left a tumble-down stone wall
across an opening, with two gates,
painted black in imitation of iron,
about fifteen rods apart. A little further
on, it became visible that an
avenue went from gate to gate, enclosing
a deep half-circle of lawn, on
which grew several fair enough elms
and a really fine maple. After such
preliminaries you expect a house;
and there it is at the head of the
avenue, a widespread building, with
a cupola in the centre, a portico in
front, and a wing at either side. It
is elevated on a deep terrace, and
has a background of woods, and
woods at either hand, only a little
removed.</p>

<p>To be consistent, this house should
be of stone, or, at least, of brick;
but it is neither. Still, it would not
be right to call it a "shingle palace;"
for its frame is a massive network
of solid oaken beams, and it is strong
enough to bear unmoved a shock
that would set nine out of every ten
modern city structures rattling down
into their cellars. When Mrs. Yorke's
grandfather built this house, in the
year 1800, English ideas and feelings
still prevailed in that region; and in
building a house, a gentleman thought
of his grandchildren, who might live
in it. Now nobody builds with any
reference to his descendants.</p>

<p>But Mr. Arnold's plans had proved
larger than his purse. The park
he meant to have had still remained
three hundred acres of wild, unfenced
land, the gardens never got beyond
a few flowers, now choked
with weeds, and the kitchen-garden,
kept alive by Patrick Chester, Mrs.
Yorke's keeper. As for the orchard,
it never saw the light. Mrs. Yorke's
father had done the place one good
turn, for he had planted vines everywhere.
Their graceful banners, in
summer-time, draped the portico, the
corners of the house, the dead oak-tree
by the western wing, and swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
here and there over rock, fence, or
stump.</p>

<p>Back of the house, toward the
right, was a huge barn and a
granary; the eaves of both under-hung
with a solid row of swallows'
nests. On this bright April morning,
the whole air was full of the twirl
and twitter of these birds, and with
the blue glancing of their wings
some invisible crystalline ring
seemed to have been let down from
the heavens over and around the
house, and they followed its outline
in their flight. But the homely,
bread-and-butter robins had no such
mystical ways. They flew or hopped
straight where they wanted to go, and
what they wanted to get was plainly
something to eat. One of them alighted
on the threshold of the open front-door
and looked curiously in. He
saw a long hall, with a staircase on
one side, and open doors to right and
left and at the furthest end. All
the wood-work, walls, and ceilings
in sight were dingy, and rats and
mice had assisted time in gnawing
away; but the furniture was bright,
and three fires visible through the
three open doors were brighter still.
Redbreast seemed to be much interested
in these fires. Probably he
was a bird from the city, and had
never seen such large ones. Those
in the front rooms were large enough,
but that in the kitchen was something
immense, and yet left room at one
side of the fireplace for a person to
sit and look up chimney, if so disposed.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon!</i>" says the bird, with a nod,
hopping in, "the kitchen is the place
to go to. As to those flowers and
cherries on the floor, I am not to be
cheated by them. They are not
good to eat, but only to walk on. I
am a bird of culture and society. I
know how people live. I am not
like that stupid chicken."</p>

<p>For a little yellow chicken, without
a sign of tail, had followed the
robin in, and was eagerly pecking at
the spots in the carpet.</p>

<p>The bird of culture hopped along
to the door at the back of the hail,
and paused again to reconnoitre.
Here a long, narrow corridor ran
across, with doors opening into the
front rooms, and one into the kitchen,
and a second stairway at one end.
Three more hops brought the bird to
the threshold of the kitchen-door,
where a third pause occurred, this
one not without trepidation; for
here in the great kitchen a woman
stood at a table with a pan of potatoes
before her. She had washed
them, and was now engaged in partially
paring them and cutting out
any suspicious spots that might be
visible on the surfaces. "It takes
me to make new potatoes out of old
ones!" she said to herself with an air
of satisfaction, tossing the potato in
in her hand into a pan of cold water.</p>

<p>This woman was large-framed and
tall, and over forty years of age.
She had a homely, sensible, pleasant,
quick-tempered face, and the base of
her nose was an hypothenuse. Her
dark hair was drawn back and made
into a smooth French twist, with a
shell comb stuck in the top a little
askew. It is hard to fasten one of
those twists with the comb quite even,
if it has much top to it. This comb
had much top. The woman's face
shone with washing; she wore a
straightly-fitting calico gown and a
white linen collar. The gown was
newly done up and a little too stiff,
and to keep it from soil she had
doubled the skirt up in front and
pinned it behind, and tied on a large
apron. For further safeguard, the
sleeves were turned up and pinned to
the shoulder by the waistbands. At
every movement she made these stiff
clothes rattled.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>This woman was Miss Betsey
Bates. She had lived at Mr. Arnold's
when Miss Amy was a young girl, had
left when she left, and was now come
back to live with her again.</p>

<p>"Just let your water bile," Betsey
began, addressing an imaginary audience&mdash;"let
your water bile, and
throw in a handful of salt; then wash
your potatoes clean; peel 'em all but
a strip or two to hold together; cut
out the spots, and let 'em lay awhile
in cold water; when it's time to cook
'em, throw 'em into your biling water,
and clap on your lid; then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Betsey stopped suddenly and
looked over her shoulder to listen,
but, hearing no carriage-wheels nor
human steps, resumed her occupation.
She did not perceive the two
little bipeds on the threshold of the
door, where they were listening to
her soliloquy with great interest,
though it was the chicken's steps
that had attracted her attention.
That silly creature, dissatisfied with
his worsted banquet, had hopped
along to the robin's side, where he
now stood with a hungry crop, round
eyes, and two or three colored threads
sticking to his bill.</p>

<p>Betsey's thoughts took a new turn.
"I must go and see to the fires, and
put a good beach chunk on each one.
There's a little chill in the air, and
everybody wants a fire after a journey.
It looks cheerful. I've got
six fires going in this house. What
do you think of that? To my idea,
an open fire in a strange house is
equal to a first cousin, sometimes
better."</p>

<p>Here a step sounded outside the
open window behind the table, and
Pat Chester appeared, a stout, fine-looking,
red-faced man, with mischievous
eyes and an honest mouth.
Curiously enough, the base of his
nose also was an hypothenuse. Otherwise
there was no resemblance between
the two. Betsey used to say
to him, "Pat, the ends of our noses
were sawed off the wrong way."</p>

<p>"Who are you talking to?" asked
Pat, stopping to look in and laugh.</p>

<p>"Your betters," was the retort.</p>

<p>"I don't envy 'em," said Pat, and
went on about his business.</p>

<p>"And I must see to them clocks
again," pursued Betsey. "The idea
of having a clock in every room in
the house! It takes me half of my
time to set 'em forward and back.
As to touching the pendulums of
such clocks as them, you don't catch
me. But I do abominate to see one
mantelpiece a quarter past and another
quarter of at the same time."</p>

<p>Here a little peck on the floor arrested
Betsey's attention, and, stretching
her neck, she saw the chicken,
and instantly flew at it with a loud
"shoo!" With its two bits of wings
extended and its head advanced as
far as possible, the little wretch fled
through the hall, peeping with terror.
But the robin flew up and escaped
over Betsey's head. "Laud
sakes!" she cried, holding on to her
comb and her eyes, "who ever saw a
chicken fly up like that?"</p>

<p>Wondering over this phenomenon,
Betsey went up-stairs and replenished
the fires in three chambers, and set
some of the clocks forward and
others back, then hurried down to
perform the same duties below stairs.
Just as she set the last hour-hand
carefully at nine o'clock, Pat put his
head in at the dining-room window.
"It's time for 'em to be here," he
said, "and I'm going down to the
gate to watch. I'll give a whistle
the minute they come in sight."</p>

<p>Immersed in her own thoughts,
Betsey had jumped violently at sound
of his voice. "I do believe you're
possessed to go round poking your
head in at windows, and scaring people
out of their wits!" she cried, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
a frightened laugh. "Here I came
within an ace of upsetting this clock
or going into the fire."</p>

<p>Pat laughed back&mdash;he and Betsey
were always scolding and always
laughing at each other&mdash;muttered
something about skittish women, and
walked off down the avenue to watch
for the family.</p>

<p>"I believe everything is ready,"
Betsey said, looking round. She took
off her apron, took down her skirt
and sleeves, and gave herself a general
crackling smoothing over. Then
suddenly she assumed an amiable
smile, looked straight before her,
dropped a short courtesy, and said,
"How do you do, Mrs. Yorke? I
hope I see you well. How do you do,
sir? How do you do, miss? I wonder
if I had better go out to the door
when they come, or stand in the entry,
or stay in the kitchen. I declare
to man I don't know what to do!
How do you do, ma'am?" beginning
her practising again, this time
before the glass. "I hope I see you
well. To think of my not being married
at all, and her having grown-up
children!" she said, staring through
the window. "The last time I saw
her, she was a pretty creature, as pale
as a snow-drop. Poor thing! she
had a hard time of it with that Jezebel.
She never said anything to me,
nor I to her; but many a time she
has come to me when that woman
has been up to her tricks, and held
on to me, and gasped for breath.
'O my heart! my heart!' she'd say.
'Don't speak to me, Betsey, but hold
me a minute!' It was awful to see
her white face, and to feel her heart
jump as if it would tear itself out.
That was the way trouble always took
hold of her."</p>

<p>She mused a moment longer, then
broke off suddenly, and began anew
her practice. "How do you do,
ma'am? I hope I see you well."</p>

<p>Presently a loud, shrill whistle interrupted
her. Betsey rushed excitedly
into the kitchen, dashed her potatoes
into the kettle, tied on a clean
apron that stood out like cast-iron
with starch, and hovered in the rear
of the hall, to be ready for advance
or retreat, as occasion might demand.</p>

<p>The old yellow coach came through
the gate, up the muddy avenue, and
drew up at the steps. The two gentlemen
got out first, then the young
ladies, and all stood around while
Mrs. Yorke slowly alighted. She
was very pale, but smiled kindly on
them, then took her son's arm, and
went up the steps. Mr. Yorke stopped
to offer his hand to a little girl
who still remained in the coach.
"My sakes!" muttered Betsey. "If
it isn't that Rowan young one!"</p>

<p>"Mother dear," said the son, "it
is possible to make a very beautiful
place of this."</p>

<p>She looked at him with a brightening
smile. "You think so, Carl?"
She had been anxiously watching
what impression the sight of her old
home would make on her family, and
exaggerating its defects in her own
imagination, as she fancied they were
doing in theirs. Their silence so far
had given her a pang, since she interpreted
it to mean disappointment,
when in truth it had meant solicitude
for her. They thought that she
would be agitated on coming again
to her childhood's home after so long
an absence. So she was; but her
own peculiar memories gave precedence
to that which concerned those
dearest to her.</p>

<p>"Besides, mother," Owen continued,
"this spot has a charm for me
which no other could have, however
beautiful: it is <em>yours</em>."</p>

<p>That word conveyed the first intimation
Mrs. Yorke had ever received
that her son felt his dependence on a
stepfather. But the pain the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
caused her was instantly banished
by the recollection that the
cause of his uneasiness was now removed.</p>

<p>"My great-grandfather had ideas,
though he did not carry them out,"
remarked Melicent. "If he had built
his house of stone, it would have
done very well. It is astonishing
that he did not. But the earlier settlers
in this country seemed to revel
in wood, probably because it had
been to them in the Old World a
luxury. With heaps of stones at
hand, they would persist in building
their houses of logs."</p>

<p>At this point Betsey rushed out to
welcome Mrs. Yorke. The sight of
that pale face which seemed to be
looking for her, and the slight, clinging
form that used to cling to her,
quite overcame her shyness.</p>

<p>"You dear creature, how glad I
am to see you once more!" she cried
out. And, seizing the lady by the
shoulders, gave her a resounding kiss
on the cheek.</p>

<p>"Please do not touch Mrs. Yorke's
left arm. It gives her palpitation,"
said the son rather stiffly.</p>

<p>Young Mr. Owen had an invincible
repugnance to personal familiarities,
especially from inferiors.</p>

<p>"Dear Betsey, this is my son," the
mother said proudly, looking at her
manly young escort, as if to see him
anew with a stranger's admiring eyes.
"Carl has heard me speak of you
many a time, my old friend!"</p>

<p>Betsey immediately dropped a solemn
courtesy. "I hope I see you
well, sir!" she said, remembering her
manners.</p>

<p>"This must be Betsey Bates!" cried
Miss Melicent, coming forward with
great cordiality. "Mamma has
spoken of you so often I knew you
at once."</p>

<p>Miss Yorke did not say that she
recognized Betsey by her nose, though
that was the fact. The impression
left on the woman's mind was of
something highly complimentary, that
some air expressive of honesty, faithfulness,
and affection, or some subtile
personal grace not universally acknowledged,
had led to the recognition.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the door,
Mrs. Yorke turned to receive her husband.
She could not utter a word;
but her face expressed what she
would have said. In her look could
be read that she placed in his hands
all that was hers, regretting only that
the gift was so small.</p>

<p>One saw then, too, that Mr. Yorke's
sarcastic face was capable of great
tenderness. As he met that mute
welcome, a look of indulgent kindness
softened his keen eyes, gave his
scornful mouth a new shape, and
lighted up his whole countenance.
But he knew better than allow his
wife to yield to any excitement of
feeling.</p>

<p>"Yes, Amy!" he said cheerfully,
"I think we shall make a very
pleasant home here. Now come in
and rest."</p>

<p>They went into the sitting-room at
the left of the hall, and Mrs. Yorke
was seated in an arm-chair there between
the fire and the sunshine, and
they all waited on her. Hester,
kneeling by her mother, removed her
gloves and overshoes, Clara took off
her bonnet and shawl, and Melicent,
after whispering a word to Betsey,
went out with that factotum, and presently
returned bearing a tin cup of
coffee on which a froth of cream still
floated.</p>

<p>"I've taken a cup, mamma," she
said, "and I can recommend it.
And breakfast will be ready in two
minutes."</p>

<p>Owen Yorke, missing one of the
company, went out, and found Edith
standing forlorn in the portico, biting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
her quivering lips, and struggling to
restrain the tears that threatened to
overflow her eyes. For the first time
in her life the child felt timid and
disconcerted. She was among her
own people, and they had forgotten
her. At that moment she longed
passionately for Dick Rowan, and
would have flown to him had it been
possible.</p>

<p>"Come, little Gypsy!" he said.
"You're not going to run away, I
hope? Did you think we had forgotten
you? See! I have not."</p>

<p>Owen Yorke's face was very winning
when he chose, and his voice
could express a good deal of kindness.
Edith looked at him steadily a moment,
then took the hand he offered,
and went into the house with him.
As they entered, Mrs. Yorke rose to
give the child an affectionate welcome
to her new home, and the
daughters gathered about her with
those bright, profuse words which are
so pleasant even when they mean so
little.</p>

<p>A folding-door opened from the
sitting-room into the dining-room,
which occupied the front half of the
west wing, and here a breakfast was
set out that dismayed the eyes of those
who were expected to partake of it.
There was a fricassee which had cost
the lives of three hens of family, and
occasioned a serious squabble between
Pat and Betsey; there was a
vast platter of ham and eggs, and a
pyramid of potatoes piled so high
that the first time it was touched one
rolled off on to the cloth. Poor Betsey
had no conception of the Yorke
ideal of a proper breakfast.</p>

<p>"The good creature has such a
generous heart!" Mrs. Yorke said,
checking with a glance the titter
which her two younger daughters had
not tried to restrain. "And I am
sure that everything is delicious."</p>

<p>Taking a seat at the table, Edith
recollected that a trial awaited her.
It was Friday; and abstinence from
meat on that day was the one point
in her mother's religion which she
knew and practised. Otherwise she
was as ignorant of it as possible.</p>

<p>Owen Yorke, sitting opposite,
watched her curiously, perceiving
that something was the matter. He
noticed the slight bracing of the muscles
of her face and neck, and that
she drew her breath in like one who
is preparing for a plunge, and kept
her eyes steadily fixed on Mr. Yorke.
Edith's way was to look at what she
feared.</p>

<p>"Some of the chicken, little niece?"
her uncle asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I do not eat meat on
Friday. I am a Roman Catholic,"
the child answered with precision.
And, having made the announcement
thus fully, shut her mouth, and sat
pale, with her eyes fixed on Mr.
Yorke's face.</p>

<p>A smile flashed into Owen Yorke's
eyes at this reply. "Little Spartan!"
he thought.</p>

<p>Edith did not miss the slight contraction
of the brows and the downward
twitch of the corners of the
mouth in the face she watched; but
the signs of displeasure passed as
quickly as they came. "Then I am
afraid you will make a poor breakfast,"
Mr. Yorke said gently. "But
I will do the best I can for you."</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence;
then the talk went on as before. But
the family were deeply annoyed. It
seemed enough that they should have
to take this little waif, with they
knew not what low habits and associates,
or what unruly fires of temper
inherited from her mother, without
having an alien religion brought
into their midst. Catholicism as they
had seen it abroad appealed to their
æsthetic sense. It floated there in a
higher atmosphere, adorned with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that wealth and culture could do.
But at home they preferred to keep
it where, as a rule, they found it&mdash;in
the kitchen and the stable.</p>

<p>After they had returned to the sitting-room,
Mr. Yorke called Edith
to him. She went trembling; for, in
spite of himself, her uncle's face wore
a judicial look. The girls, who were
just going up-stairs, lingered to hear
what would be said, and Owen took
his stand behind Mr. Yorke's chair,
and looked at the child with an encouraging
smile.</p>

<p>"Were the family you lived with
Catholics, my dear?" the judge began.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Only Mr. Rowan was
when he was a little boy."</p>

<p>"And Mr. Rowan wished to make
a Catholic of you?" Mr. Yorke said,
his lip beginning to curl.</p>

<p>The child lifted her head. "Mr.
Rowan had nothing to say about
me," she replied. "It was my mother."</p>

<p>A slight smile went round the circle.
They quite approved of her reply.</p>

<p>"But you cannot recollect your
mother?" Mr. Yorke continued.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," Edith said with animation.
"I remember how she looked,
and what she said. She made me
hold up my hands, and promise that
I would be a Roman Catholic if I
had to die for it. And that was the
last word she ever said."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke gave a short nod. To
his mind the matter was settled.
"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">N'est ce pas?</i>" he said to his wife.</p>

<p>She bowed gravely. "There is no
other way. It is impossible to ask
her to break a promise so given.
When she is older, she can choose
for herself."</p>

<p>"Well, you hear, girls?" Mr. Yorke
said, looking at his daughters. "Now
take her, and make her feel at
home."</p>

<p>Miss Yorke was dignified and inscrutable,
Hester unmistakably cold,
but Clara took her cousin's hand
with the utmost cordiality, and was
leading her from the room, when
Edith stopped short, her eyes attracted
by a cabinet portrait in oils that
stood on a shelf near the door. This
portrait represented a young man,
with one of those ugly, beautiful
faces which fascinate us, we know
not why. Careless, profuse locks of
golden brown clustered around his
head, steady, agate-colored eyes followed
the beholder wherever he went,
and seemed at once defying him to
escape and entreating him not to go,
and the sunshine of a hidden smile
softened the curves of the mouth and
chin.</p>

<p>Edith's eyes sparkled, her face grew
crimson, and she clasped her hands
tightly on her breast.</p>

<p>"That is your father's portrait, my
dear," Mrs. Yorke said, going to her.
"Do you recognize it?"</p>

<p>The child restrained herself one
moment, then she ran to the picture,
clasped her arms around it, and kissed
it over and over, weeping passionately.
"It is mine! It is mine!"
she cried out, when her aunt tried
to soothe her.</p>

<p>"You are right, dear!" Mrs. Yorke
said, much affected. "I am sure no
one will object to your having the
portrait. You may take it to your
own chamber, if you wish."</p>

<p>Edith controlled herself, wiped her
eyes, and put the picture down.
"Dear Aunt Amy," she said, "you
know I want it; but I won't take it
unless you and Uncle Charles are
quite willing."</p>

<p>It was touching, her first acknowledgment
of kinship, and expression
of trust and submission. They cordially
assured her of their willingness,
kissed her again in token of a closer
adoption, and smiled after her as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
went off with her father's portrait
clasped to her heart.</p>

<p>Melicent and Hester still lingered.
Melicent remembered faintly her Uncle
Robert's marriage, and the disagreeable
feeling in the family at that
time. It had left on her mind a prejudice
against "that Polish girl," and
a shade of disfavor toward her daughter.
But she said nothing.</p>

<p>"It will be so disagreeable having
a Catholic in the family!" Hester
complained.</p>

<p>"Hester, listen to me!" her father
said severely. "I want no bigotry
nor petty persecutions in my family.
Your Cousin Edith has as good a
right to her religion as you have to
yours; and if either should find herself
disagreeably situated, it is she,
for she is alone. Don't forget this;
and don't let there be anything offensive
said, or hinted, or looked. I
mean to be consistent, and allow others
the same freedom which I claim
myself. Now, let me hear no more
of this."</p>

<p>Hester took refuge in tears. It
was her sole argument. She was
one of those soft creatures who require
to be petted, and have a talent
for being abused. Possibly, too, she
was a little jealous of this new member
of the family.</p>

<p>"Melicent, will you lead away this
weeping nymph, and dry her tears?"
the father said impatiently. "Common
sense is too robust for her constitution."</p>

<p>The sisters went up-stairs, and
Owen followed them presently, and
climbed to the cupola. Leaning on
the window-sill there, he looked off
over the country. The horizon was
a ring of low blue hills, with a grand
amethyst glittering to tell where the
sea lay. Through the centre of this
vast circle glimmered the river, silver,
and gold, and steel-blue, and the
white houses of the town lay like a
heap of lilies scattered on its banks.
Everywhere else was forest.</p>

<p>Shadows of varying thought swept
over the young man's face as he
looked off, and drew freer breath
from the distance. "Henceforth my
shield must bear a martlet," he muttered.
"But whither shall I fly?"</p>

<p>That was the problem he was studying.
He had come to this place
only to see his family settled, and
collect his own thoughts after their
sudden fall from prosperity; then he
would go out into the world, and
work his own way. It was not pleasant,
the change from that life of
noble leisure and lofty work which
he had planned, to one where compulsory
labor for mere bread must
occupy the greater part of his time;
but it was inevitable. And as he
looked abroad now, and breathed
the fresh air that came frolicking out
of the northwest, and remembered
how wide the world is and how many
veins in it are unwrought, his young
courage rose, and the plans he had
been building up for that year crumbled
and ceased to excite his regret.</p>

<p>Only a few months before their
change of circumstances, his mother
had been won to consent that he
might visit Asia. He had meant to
go north, south, east, and west, in
that shabby, glorious old land, make
himself for the nonce Tartar, Chinese,
Indian, Persian, what not, and
get a look at creation through the
eyes of each. This young man's
sympathies were by no means narrow.
He had never been able to
believe that God smiles with peculiar
fondness on any particular continent,
island, peninsula, or part of either,
and is but a stepfather to the rest
of the world. He was born with a
hatred of barriers. He sympathized
with Swift, who "hated all nations,
professions, and communities, and
gave all his love to individuals." Or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
better than Swift, he had at least a
theoretical love for mankind unfenced.
He did not have to learn to
love, that came naturally to him; he
had to learn to hate. But he was a
good hater. Take him all in all,
Carl Owen Yorke was at twenty-one
a noble, generous youth, of good
mind and unstained reputation; and
it was no proof of excessive vanity
in him that he believed himself capable
of taking any position he might
strive for.</p>

<p>"My dear Minerva tells me that I
have in me some of the elements of
failure," he said. "I wonder what
they are?"</p>

<p>This "dear Minerva" was Miss
Alice Mills, Mr. Robert Yorke's deserted
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>. She and Owen were
very close friends. It was one of
those friendships which sometimes
grow up between a woman whose
youth is past and a youth whose
manhood has scarcely arrived. Such
a friendship may effect incalculable
good or incalculable harm, as the
woman shall choose.</p>

<p>"Well," he concluded, not caring
to puzzle over the riddle, "she will
explain, I suppose, when she writes.
And if anybody can get at the cube-root
of the difficulty, she can."</p>

<p>Meantime, while the son was musing,
and the daughters were selecting
their chambers, and making up a
toilet for Edith, Mr. Yorke had sent
for Patrick Chester in the sitting-room,
and was questioning him concerning
Catholic affairs in Seaton. They did
not seem to be in a flourishing condition.</p>

<p>There was no priest settled there,
Patrick said; but one came over
from B&mdash;&mdash; once in two months, and
said Mass for them. They had no
church yet, but a little chapel, what
there was left of it.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" his
master asked.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, some of the Seaton
rowdies got into the chapel, one night,
not long ago, and smashed the windows,
and broke up the tabernacle,
and destroyed the pictures entirely.
And they twisted off the crucifix,
though it was of iron, two inches
wide and half an inch thick. The
devil must have helped the man that
did it, savin' your presence, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Are they vandals here?" demanded
Mr. Yorke.</p>

<p>"There are some fine folks in Seaton,"
said Pat, who did not know
what vandals are. "But the rowdies
have everything pretty much their
own way."</p>

<p>"And is there no law in the town?"
asked Mr. Yorke wrathfully.</p>

<p>"There's a good many lawyers,"
said Pat, scratching his head.</p>

<p>"You mean to say that there was
no effort made to discover and punish
the perpetrators of such an outrage?"
exclaimed his master.</p>

<p>"Indeed there was not, sir!" Pat
answered. "People knew pretty well
who did the mischief, and that the
fellow that broke off the crucifix was
taken bleeding at the lungs just after;
but nobody molested 'em. It wouldn't
be well for the one who would lift
his voice against the Seaton rowdies.
Why, some of 'em belong to as wealthy
families as there are in town.
They began with a cast-iron band
years ago, and everybody laughed at
'em. All the harm they did was to
wake people out of sleep. Then
they broke up a lecture. It was a
Mr. Fowle from Boston, who was
preaching about education. And
then they did a little mischief here
and there to people they didn't like,
and now they are too strong to put
down. And, indeed, sir, when it's
against the Catholics they are, nobody
wants to put 'em down."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke glanced at his wife.
She did not look up nor deny Patrick's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
charges. She was a little
ashamed of the character of her native
town in this respect; for at
that time Seaton was notorious for
its lawlessness, and was even proud
of its reputation. No great harm
had been done, they said. It was
only the boys' fun. They were sorry,
it is true, that a respectable lecturer
should have been insulted; but that
a Catholic chapel should be desecrated,
that was nothing. They did
not give it a second thought.</p>

<p>"Well, Patrick," Mr. Yorke resumed,
"my niece, Miss Edith Yorke, is
a Catholic, and I wish her to have
proper instruction, and to attend to
the services of her church when there
is opportunity. Let me know the
next time your priest comes here, and
I will call to see him. Now you
may go."</p>

<h2>OUR LADY OF GUADALUPE.</h2>


<p>The story and celebration of Our
Lady of Guadalupe are not so familiar
to Catholics, or so well appreciated
by others, as to render useless
or uninteresting, especially in this
month of Mary, an account of her veneration
in Mexico. What this actually,
veritably is, no writer, so far
as we are aware, has yet undertaken
to show&mdash;at least, from such literary
evidences of popular conviction as
best illustrate the subject. How anything
supernatural could shine or
blossom in a land of wars, robbers,
Indians, is an old doubt, notwithstanding
that revelations have taken place
in countries which needed them less
than did the once idolatrous Aztecs.
Let us now endeavor to make clear
what the true nature of the miracle
of Guadalupe is; to exhibit its real
veneration by means of testimonies
borrowed from the worthiest Mexicans;
and to prove that the faith of
Guadalupe is not shallow, but long
and well-established, widespread, and
sincere.</p>

<p>Here follows a brief history of the
renowned miracle of Tepeyac. In
1531, ten years after the conquest,
the pious and simple Indian, Juan
Diego, was on his way to the village
of Guadalupe, near the city of Mexico,
there to receive the instructions
of some reverend fathers. Suddenly,
at the hill of Tepeyac appeared to
him the Blessed Virgin, who commanded
her amazed client to go forthwith
to the bishop, and make known
that she wished a church to be built
in her honor upon that spot. Next
day the Blessed Virgin returned to
hear the regret of Juan Diego that
he could not obtain the ear of the
bishop. "Go back," said the Holy
Lady, "and announce that I, Mary,
Mother of God, send thee." The
Indian again sought his bishop, who
this time required that he should
bring some token of the presence and
command of his patroness. On the
12th of December, Juan Diego again
saw Our Lady, who ordered him
to climb to the top of the barren
rock of Tepeyac and there gather
roses for her. To his great astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
he found the roses flourishing
on the rock, and brought them to his
patroness, who threw them into his
tilma or apron, and said: "Go back
to the bishop and show him these
credentials." Again came the Indian
before the bishop, and, opening his
tilma to show the roses, lo! there appeared
impressed upon it a marvellous
image of the Blessed Virgin.
The bishop was awestruck and overcome.
The miraculous occurrence
was made known and proved. Processions
and Masses celebrated it,
and its fame spread far and wide.
A large new cathedral was erected
on the hill of Guadalupe, and multitudes
from all parts flocked thither.
Specially noteworthy is the fact that
the new shrine to Our Lady was
erected in the place where once the
Indians worshipped their goddess Totantzin,
mother of other deities, and
protectress of fruits and fields. The
marvellous picture was found impressed
upon the rudest cloth, that
of a poor Indian's apron, the last
upon which to attempt a painter's artifice&mdash;and
hence the greater wonder,
the artistic testimony regarding
which is something formidable and
wonderful in itself.</p>

<p>What is known in Mexico as the
Day of Guadalupe is extraordinary
as a popular manifestation. On the
12th of December every year, fifteen
or twenty thousand Indians congregate
in the village of that name
to celebrate the anniversary of the
Marvellous Apparition. The whole
way to the famous suburb is crowded
with cabs, riders, and pedestrians
of the poorest sort, a great number
of them bare-footed. All day there is
an ever-moving multitude to and
from the village, and, indeed, the
majority of the inhabitants of the city
of Mexico seem to be included in the
parties, families, and caravans of
strangely contrasted people that wend
their way to the shrines on the hill.
The most numerous class of pilgrims
are the saddest and the most wretched&mdash;we
mean the ill-clad, ill-featured,
simple, devoted Indians. On them
the luxuries of the rich, the passions
of the fighters, the intrigues of politicians,
have borne with ruinous effect.
Drudging men and women; hewers
of wood and drawers of water; bare-breasted
peasants, with faces dusky
and dusty, the same who any day
may be seen on Mexican roads carrying
burdens of all sorts strapped to
their backs; children in plenty, bare,
unkempt, untidy, and sometimes swaddled
about their mothers' shoulders;
numerous babes at the breast, half-nude&mdash;these
are some of the features
in a not overdrawn picture of the primitive
poverty which assembles at
Guadalupe, and, in fact, in every
Mexican multitude whatsoever. Perhaps
nowhere outside of Mexico and
the race of Indians can such a problem
of multitudinous poverty be seen.
Its victims are those over whom the
desert-storms of wars and feuds innumerable
have passed, and, spite of
all their wanderings as a race, they
yet wear the guise and character of
tribes who are still trying to find their
way out of a wilderness or a barren
waste. Let enthusiasts for self-willed
liberty say what they will, wars
of fifty years are anything but conservative
of happiness, cleanliness,
good morals, and that true liberty
which should always accompany
them. However fondly we cherish
our ideals of freedom, we must yet
bear in mind the wholesome, wholesale
truth of history, that no actual
liberty is reached by the dagger and
guillotine, or by massacre, or is
founded on bad blood or bad faith.
Those who lately celebrated the execution
of Louis XVI. and the intellectual
system of murder established
by Robespierre, and not totally disapproved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
by Mr. Carlyle, have good
reason to be cautious as to how they
offend this menacing truth.</p>

<p>A cathedral and four chapels are
the principal structures of the picturesque
hillside village of Guadalupe.
By a winding ascent among steep,
herbless rocks, tufted here and there
with the thorny green slabs of the cactus,
is reached at some distance from
the cathedral the highest of the chapels,
which contains the original imprint
of the figure of Our Lady.
Looking up to the chapel from the
crowd at the cathedral may be seen
a striking picture, not unlike what
Northern travellers have been taught
to fancy of the middle ages, but the
elements of which are still abundant
in the civilization of Europe. It is
simply the curious crowd of pilgrims
going up and down the hill, to and
from the quaint old chapel, built perhaps
centuries ago. The scene from
the height itself is charming and impressive.
The widespread valley of
Mexico&mdash;including lakes, woods, villages,
and a rich and substantial city,
with towers and domes that take enchantment
from distance&mdash;is all before
the eye in one serene view of
landscape. In the village there is a
multitude like another Israel, sitting
in the dust or standing near the pulquerias,
or moving about near the
church door. As Guadalupe is for
the most part composed of adobe
houses, and as its mass of humble
visitors have little finery to distinguish
their brown personages from
the dust out of which man was originally
created, the complexion of the
general scene which they constitute
can only be described as earth-like
and earth-worn. Elsewhere than in
a superficial glance at the poverty of
Guadalupe we must seek for the
meaning of its spectacle. Is this
swarming, dull-colored scene but an
animated fiction? No&mdash;it is the natural
seeking the supernatural. And
the supernatural&mdash;what is it? It is
redemption and immortality, our Lord
and Our Lady, the angels and saints.</p>

<p>The cathedral is a building of picturesque
angles, but, except that it
is spacious, as so many of the Mexican
churches are, makes no particular
boast of architecture. A copy
of the marvellous tilma, over the altar,
poetically represents Our Lady
in a blue cloak covered with stars,
and a robe said to be of crimson and
gold, her hands clasped, and her
foot on a crescent supported by a
cherub. This is the substance of a
description of it given by a traveller
who had better opportunities for seeing
it closely than had the present
writer during the fiesta of Guadalupe
in 1867. Whether the original picture is
rude or not, from being impressed upon
a blanket, he has not personal knowledge,
though aware that it has been
described as rude. Nevertheless, its
idea and design are beautiful and
tender. Everywhere in Mexico it is
the favorite and, indeed, the most
lovely presentment of Our Lady.
Like a compassionate angel of the
twilight, it looks out of many a
shrine, and, among all the images for
which the Mexican Church is noted,
none is perhaps more essentially
ideal, and, in that point of view, <em>real</em>.
Where it appears wrought in a sculpture
of 1686, by Francisco Alberto,
on the side of San Agustin's at the
capital, it is, though quaint, very admirable
for its purity and gentleness.
Time respects it, and the birds have
built their nests near it. The various
chapels in and about the city dedicated
to Our Lady of Guadalupe
are recognized by the star-mantled
figure. The Baths of the Peñon,
the cathedral at the Plaza, the suburb
of Tacubaya, have each their pictorial
witnesses of the faith of Guadalupe;
and to say that its manifestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
abounds in Mexico is but to state a
fact of commonplace. Rich and
poor venerate the tradition of the
Marvellous Appearance, now for
three centuries celebrated, and always,
it seems, by multitudes.</p>

<p>What else is to be seen at Guadalupe
besides its crowd and its altar
is not worthy of extended remark.
The organs of the cathedral are high
and admirably carved; over the altar's
porphyry columns are cherubim
and seraphim, all too dazzling with
paint and gold. Here, as in other
places of Spanish worship, the figures
of the crucifixion have been designed
with a painful realism. Outside of
the church a party of Indians, displaying
gay feathers, danced in honor
of the feast, as their sires must have
done hundreds of years ago. Inside
it was densely crowded with visitors
or pilgrims, and far too uncomfortable
at times to make possible the
most accurate observation of its ornaments.
But it may be well to repeat
that the church is divided into
three naves by eight columns, and is
about two hundred feet long, one
hundred and twenty feet broad, and
one hundred high. The total cost
of the building, and, we presume, its
altars, is reckoned as high as $800,000,
most of it, if not all, contributed
by alms. The altar at which is
placed the image of Our Lady is
said to have cost $381,000, its tabernacle
containing 3,257 marks of silver,
and the gold frame of the sacred picture
4,050 castellanos. The church's
ornaments are calculated to be
worth more than $123,000. Two of
its candlesticks alone weighed 2,213
castellanos in gold, and one lamp
750 marks of silver. To Cristobal
de Aguirre, who, in 1660, built a hermitage
on the summit of Tepeyac,
we owe the foundation of the chapel
there. It was not, however, until
1747 that Our Lady of Guadalupe
was formally declared the patroness
of the whole of Mexico.</p>

<p>Of the many celebrations of Mexico,
none are altogether as significant
as that of Guadalupe. It has
become national, and, in a certain
sense, religiously patriotic. Maximilian
and Carlota, the writer was informed,
washed the feet of the poor
near the altar of Our Lady, according
to a well-known religious custom.
The best men and women of Mexico
have venerated the Marvellous Appearance&mdash;which,
however amusing
it may be to those who are scarcely
as radical in their belief in nature as
conservative in their views of the
supernatural, is but a circumstance
to the older traditions which have
entered into the mind of poetry and
filled the heart of worship. What
of the wonderful happenings to the
great fathers of the church and the
mediæval saints, all worshippers of
unquestionable sublimation? Say
what you please, doubt as you may,
saints, angels, miracles, abide, and
form the very testament of belief.
There is not a Catholic in the world
who does not believe in miracle,
whose faith is not to unbelievers a
standing miracle of belief in a miracle
the most prodigious, the most
portentous; and yet to him it has
only become natural to believe in
the supernatural. The Mexicans venerate
what three centuries and uncounted
millions have affirmed, whence
it appears that their veneration is
not a conceit or humbug, but at root
a faith. How can this be more clearly
illustrated than by quoting the
following very interesting poem of
Manuel Carpio, Mexico's favorite, if
not best modern poet:</p>

<p>Manuel Carpio, who wrote this,
his first poetic composition, in 1831,
when forty years of age, was a scholar
and professor, and in 1824 a congressman.
He made the Bible, we
are told, his favorite study; and certainly
it supplied him with the themes
for his best poems. But he was not
the only poet of Mexico who bore
earnest witness to the faith of which
we speak. Padre Manuel Sartorio,
who wrote about the time of Iturbide,
deprecates the idea of preferring
a capricious doubt respecting
"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">la Virgen de Guadalupe</span>" to
a constant belief founded in tradition.
In the following lines the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
nature of his own belief is fully attested:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Of Guadalupe, that fair image pictured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the venerating eye of Mexico;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stars and light adorned, the figure painted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a most modest Maiden, full of grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What image is it? Copy 'tis divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the Mother of God.<br /></span>
<div class="tb"><span class="lspace2 rspace2">*</span><span class="lspace2 rspace2">*</span><span class="lspace2 rspace2">*</span><span class="lspace2 rspace2">*</span><span class="lspace2 rspace2">*</span></div>
<span class="i0">And what assures me this? My tender thought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who the design conceived? The holiest love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then portrayed it? The eternal God."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In other lines on the same subject,
Sartorio speaks of the Lady of Guadalupe
as "the purest rose of the celestial
field," and pays special respect
to her image in the Portal of
Flowers, of which there is a tradition,
not vulgar, of having spoken (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hay
tradicion no vulgar de haber hablado</span>)
to the Venerable Padre Zapa, in
order to instruct the Indians, as relates
Cabrera, "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Escudo de Armas de
Mexico, numero 923</span>." Who this
Cabrera may be we are not aware,
and cannot affirm that he is identical
with the great painter Cabrera, whose
belief in Our Lady of Guadalupe was
so distinct and positive.</p>

<p>One other poet of Mexico we shall
summon to give testimony. It is
Fray Manuel Navarrete, who wrote
a series of poems, well-known to his
countrymen, called "Sad Moments."
He was also the author of a number
of tributes to the fame of Carlos IV.
and Ferdinand VII., and seems to
have possessed more influence, if not
more merit as a poet, than Padre Sartorio.
From a posthumous volume,
bearing date of 1823, we take the following
lines, the allusions of which
sufficiently explain at what time they
were written:</p>

<p class="center">TO THE MOST HOLY VIRGIN UNDER

<p>How sadly, how oddly, sounds in
modern ears this felicitation of a poet
that peace, which has left the greater
part of the world, has taken refuge in
Mexico! Evidently our Fray Navarrete
did not foresee the results of
the war begun by the clerical revolutionist
Hidalgo. But whatever
may have been the political bias of
this religious writer, he retains the esteem
of his countrymen as one of the
fathers of their fragmentary literature.</p>

<p>Our last witness is Miguel Cabrera,
the great Mexican painter, whose
merits have with reason been compared
by an Italian traveller, the
Count Beltrami, to those of Correggio
and Murillo. Altogether, as carver,
architect, and painter, the New World
has not produced the equal in art of
this extraordinary man, who wrought
almost without masters or models,
without emulation or fitting aid and
recompense, and whose worth has
yet to be made well known to the
continent which he honored. But
our object now is to lend the weight
of this preface to the following statement
of the Mexican writer, Señor
Orozco y Berra:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Cabrera wrote a short treatise dedicated
to his protector Sr. Salinas [Archbishop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of Mexico] with the title of <i>The
American Marvel, and Conjunction of Rare
Marvels, observed with the direction of the
Rules of the Art of Painting, in the Miraculous
Image [<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">prodigiosa imagen</span>] of Our Lady
of Guadalupe of Mexico</i>. It is a small
book in quarto, printed in 1756 by the
press of the college of San Ildefonso,
and containing thirty pages, with dedication,
approbations, and license at the
beginning, and the opinions of various
painters at the end. The reason given
for this writing was the invitation made
by the abbot and council of the college
to the best known painters of Mexico, in
order that, after examining the painting
on cloth of Our Lady of Guadalupe, they
might declare if it could be the work
of human hands. Cabrera was one of
those who joined in the examination, and
in his book he undertakes to show that
<i>the Virgin is not painted in a manner artificial
and human</i>."</p></blockquote>

<h2>STATISTICS OF PROTESTANTISM IN THE UNITED STATES.</h2>


<p>Under the term <i>Protestantism</i>, it is
intended to comprise all persons
of any religious sect, denomination,
or church in this country, except Catholics,
Jews, and Chinese. So numerous
are the divisions and subdivisions
that our limits will permit us
to present only the name of each,
with perhaps a word as to its distinctive
features, its numbers at different
periods, and its average annual increase
for a given period. The given
period thus selected is the twenty-five
years and upward preceding
the year 1868; because the statistics
of all the denominations which are
accessible, are at present more complete
up to that date than they have
yet become up to any subsequent
year, or even up to the present date.
The statistics are taken entirely from
Protestant sources, and chiefly from
official documents published by the
respective denominations. The final
results are then brought together, and
compared with the results presented
by the Federal census of the population
at different periods.</p>

<p>1. The name "Lutheran" was
given to the first Protestant denomination,
in order to designate the followers
of Martin Luther. A part
of the members of the denomination
in this country have recently changed
their name to "Evangelical Lutheran
Church."</p>

<p>The statistics, chiefly official, of the
denomination for a series of years
have been as follows:</p>

<p>2. The German Reformed denomination
made its appearance, soon
after the Lutheran, in the German
part of Switzerland, and sprang out
of a dispute between Ulrich Zwingli
and Martin Luther concerning the
import of the words, "This is my
body," "This is my blood."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The "Moravians," or United
Brethren, are a distinct denomination
from the preceding one. As known
in this country, they descended from a
colony of dissenters, who were first
gathered on his estate in Upper Alsatia,
in 1772, by Count Zinzendorf.</p>

<p>Their numbers have been stated

as it was known until 1867, when the
name was changed to "Reformed
Church in America," is a descendant
of the Dutch Reformed Church of
Holland.</p>

<p>6. The Mennonites derive their
name from Menno Simon, born in
Friesland <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1495. He was contemporary
with Luther, Bucer, and
Bullinger. He obtained a great number
of followers. In 1683, the first
of them came over to this country,
others soon followed.</p>

<p>Their number has been estimated
as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Mennonites" width="60%">

<p>The average annual increase in
members in twenty-four years has
been 380.</p>

<p>7. The Reformed Mennonite Society
was first organized in 1811. The
members ascribe their origin to the
corruptions of the Mennonites. The
reform extended into several counties
of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and New
York, but their doctrines are regarded
as too rigid for general acceptance.</p>

<p>In 1860, their numbers were estimated
at about 11,000.</p>

<p>The average annual increase has
been about 200.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>8. The denomination known as
the "German Evangelical Association"
first appeared in one of the
Middle States, about the year 1800.</p>

<p>This denomination is now regarded
as German Methodists, and their
numbers have been as follows:</p>

</table></div>

<p>The average annual increase of the
denomination in twenty-four years
has been 1,791.</p>

<p>9. The "Christians," or "Christian
Connection," profess not to owe their
origin to the labors of any one man,
like the other Protestant sects. They
rose almost simultaneously in different
and remote parts of this country,
without knowledge of each other's
movements.</p>

<p>The new organizations of this denomination
held their twenty-third
annual convention in June, 1868.
The number of organizations was
one hundred and sixty.</p>

<p>The numbers of the denomination
have been stated as follows:</p>

<p>The "Church of God," as it exists
by that name in the United States,
is a religious community, who profess
to have come out from all human
and unscriptural organizations, and
to have fallen back upon original
grounds, and who wish, therefore, to
be known and called by no other
distinctive name.</p>

<p>This denomination exists in Ohio
and Pennsylvania and the Western
States, and their numbers have been
stated as follows:</p>

<p>11. The denominations thus far
noticed are chiefly of German origin.
The next class contains those of Scottish
origin. Among these the Presbyterian
holds the first place in age
and numbers. The first organization
here was made in 1706, and
known as the Presbytery of Philadelphia.
Their first synod was convened
September 17, 1718.</p>

<p>The first General Assembly met in
1789, and a more efficient and extensive
development ensued. In 1810,
a division arose, and the formation
of the "Cumberland Presbyterian"
organization. But the most extensive
division took place in 1838, by
which a body was organized and
known as the "New School," while
those who remained were designated
as "Old School" Presbyterians. The
split thus made has continued for
thirty years, but is now ostensibly removed
by measures of reunion.</p>

<p>The statistics of the "Old School"
Presbyterians for the year 1863 first
show the effect of the separation of
the Southern portion during the war.
The report of numbers has been as
follows:</p>

<p>12. The division of the Presbyterian
Church was entirely consummated
in 1840, by the meeting of a General
Assembly representing the seceders,
or "New School."</p>

<p>Subsequently, the loss of the Southern
churches by the "Old School"
denomination, and the increase of the
anti-slavery sentiment in the Northern
portion, suggested a reunion with
the "New School" soon after the
outbreak of the recent war. At
length, in 1868, one General Assembly
met in Albany, while the other
was in session in Harrisburg, Pa. A
plan of union was mutually prepared,
which, on being approved by the local
presbyteries, went into effect in 1870.</p>

Presbyterians have been as follows:</p>

<p>14. The "Synod of Reformed Presbyterians"
was formed by certain
persons who separated from the Reformed
Presbyterians (General Synod),
principally on the ground that they
were of opinion that the constitution
and government of the United States
are essentially infidel and immoral.
The separation took place in 1833.</p>

<p>The few statements relative to the
numbers of this denomination have
been as follows:</p>

been 108.</p>

<p>15. Another division is the "Associate
Presbyterian Church." This is
located chiefly in the Middle and
Western States. The members of
the denomination claim to be a
branch of the Church of Scotland.</p>

<p>In 1858, the Associate Reformed
and the Associate churches reunited
under the name of "United Presbyterian
Church in North America."</p>

Presbyterian denomination after 1859
are merged in those of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>

<p>16. Another order of Presbyterians
in this country is known as the "Associate
Reformed Church." Since
1822, the denomination has existed
in three independent divisions, the
Northern, the Western, and the Southern.
These divisions are quite small
in numbers, and their growth has
been insignificant. They have been
stated as follows:</p>

<p>The Associate Reformed Synod of
New York in 1843 had 34 ministers
and 43 congregations. In 1867, it
had 16 ministers and 1,631 members.</p>

<p>The Associate Reformed Synod of
the South in 1843 had 25 ministers
and 40 congregations; and in 1867,
estimated at 1,500 members.</p>

<p>The Associate Synod of North
America in 1867 had 11 ministers
and 778 members.</p>

<p>The Free Presbyterian Synod, consisting,
in 1861, of 41 ministers and
4,000 members, had previously separated
from the New School Presbyterian
denomination, but was reunited
and absorbed after the outbreak
of the recent war.</p>

<p>17. The Independent Presbyterian
Church in South and North Carolina
consisted, in 1861, of 4 ministers and
about 1,000 members.</p>

<p>18. Another denomination of Presbyterians
remains to be noticed. It
is called the "Cumberland Presbyterians"
and first appeared in Kentucky
in the year 1800. In 1829, there
were four synods and the first General
Assembly of the denomination
was held. During the recent war
the Southern churches were not reported
in the Assembly, and there are
no complete statistics of that period.</p>

have been stated as follows:</p>

55 years, from 1812 to 1867, has been
1,819.</p>

<p>19. Another large class of denominations
is known by the name of
"Baptists." They are divided into
ten separate sects: Baptists; Free-Will
Baptists; Seventh-Day Baptists;
German Baptists or Brethren; German
Seventh-Day Baptists; Free
Communion Baptists; Old School
Baptists; Six-Principle Baptists; River
Brethren; Disciples of Christ, or
Campbellites.</p>

<p>22. There is a denomination of
German Baptists which has assumed
for itself the name of "Brethren,"
but they are commonly called "Dunkers"
or "Tunkers" to distinguish
them from the Mennonists. They
have also been called "Tumblers"
from the manner in which they perform
baptism, which is by putting the
person head forward under water
(while kneeling), so as to resemble
the motion of the body in the act
of tumbling.</p>

<p>In 1843, their larger congregations
contained from two to three hundred
members; but little was then known
among themselves of their numbers.
Their subsequent statistics have been
as follows:</p>

a few small churches, and 104 members
were reported.</p>

<p>25. The "Old School," or Anti-mission,
Baptists were formerly a portion
of the regular Baptists, above-mentioned.
They are opposed to
the academical or theological education
of their ministers, and to Bible,

<p>25. The denomination called "Six-Principle
Baptists" originated in
Rhode Island as early as 1665. They
are distinguished from other Baptists
by deducing their peculiarities from
the first three verses of the sixth chapter
of Hebrews.</p>

<p>27. The "River Brethren" is an
organization in Pennsylvania and
other states, so-called to distinguish
them from the German Baptists or
Brethren above-mentioned.</p>

<p>Their meetings are generally held
in dwelling-houses, or barns fitted

Puritans, since known as "Congregationalists,"
was in the early part
of Queen Elizabeth's reign. The
first church formed upon Congregational
principles was that established
by Robert Browne in 1583. The denomination

arose in this country from a
division of opinion among Congregationalists
on the divinity of Christ.
Their statistics contain no report of
the membership. All who are respectable

society are admitted to the sacraments
if they desire to be.</p>

<p>Their numbers for a series of years

first made its appearance
in England about 1750. In Gloucester,
Massachusetts, the first Universalist
society was formed in 1779.
No statistics of the denomination
contain the "membership" like those
of other denominations, as to believe
is to become a member. The active
members have been estimated in
1850 at 60,000, although the population
among which Universalism
exists to the exclusion of other denominations
may be ten times greater.</p>

<p>The average annual increase since
the separation of the South, and during
seventeen years, has been 30,377.
Since the close of the war conferences
have been organized in eight of
the Southern states, and 100,000
members gained from the church
South.</p>

<p>34. A secession took place in 1830
from the Methodists, and the persons
who composed it assumed the name
of the "Methodist Protestant Church."

<p>In 1866, a convention was held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>in Cincinnati to unite the Methodist
Protestants, the Wesleyan Connection,
the Free Methodists, the Primitive Methodists,
and some independent Methodist
congregations, under the name
of the "Methodist Church." The union
was joined by few save the Northern
conferences of the Methodist
Protestant body, who now compose
the Methodist Church; the Southern
conferences retain the original
name of Methodist Protestant. Their
numbers in 1867 were estimated at
50,000; in 1869, they were estimated
at 72,000.</p>

<p>There has been no actual increase
in those now indicated by this name
in twenty-five years preceding 1868.</p>

<p>35. The "Methodist Church" is
composed of the Northern conferences
of the Methodist Protestant
Church which, in attempting to form
a union with others in 1866, caused
a split among themselves. Their report,
made in 1867, states as follows:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>This is strictly an increase of the
Methodist Protestants, but appears
under a new name. It is an average
annual increase of 2,000.</p>

<p>36. Out of the original separation
of the Methodist Protestants from
the Methodist Episcopal another denomination
sprang up, under the
name of the "True Wesleyan Methodists."</p>

<p>The denomination has increased
very slowly since its organization, as
appears by the following statements:</p>

<p>37. The African Methodist Episcopal
Church owes its origin to the
prejudice against the colored members
and attendants of the Methodist
Episcopal Church. In the early days
of the latter, this prejudice was so
deep that the colored persons were
not unfrequently pulled from their
knees while at prayer in the church,
and ordered to the back seats.</p>

<p>This denomination has greatly increased
by the addition of emancipated
slaves. Its statistics are as
follows:</p>

<p>The average annual increase in

<p>38. The operation of the same
prejudice against color in New York
gave rise to the "Zion African Methodist
Episcopal Church." Its statistics
show a large increase recently
at the South, and are as follows:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>The average annual increase of
the denomination has been 2,008.</p>

<p>39. The "Methodist Episcopal
Church, South," is the second largest
body of Methodists in the United
States. It arose from a division of
the Methodist Episcopal Church, in
accordance with resolutions of the
General Conference in 1844.</p>

<p>The membership of this denomination
has been reduced by the war,
by the invasion of its territory by
the Northern Methodist Episcopal,
and by the African and Zion churches.
Its statistics are as follows:</p>

originated in 1859, and consisted of
a few congregations in New York
and other Northern states. Its statistics
have been as follows:</p>

<p>The average annual increase in

<p>41. The "Western Primitive Methodist
Church" held its twenty-second
annual conference in New Diggings,
Wisconsin, 1866. The subject
of union with other non-episcopal
bodies was favorably considered.
Their numbers were in 1865 as follows:
Preachers, 20; members, 2,000.</p>

<p>42. The "Independent Methodist
Church" organized its first congregation
in New York City in 1860.
The third annual session of its conference
was held in 1864, and a
movement made toward union with
other non-episcopal bodies.</p>

<p>43. The "Friends," or "Quakers,"
arose in England about 1647, under
the preaching of Mr. George Fox.
The numbers of this denomination
are estimated at 100,000, comprised
in eight yearly meetings.</p>

<p>44. A division took place during
the first quarter of the present century
among the Friends, under Mr.
Elias Hicks. A distinct and independent
association was made under
his name. Their numbers are estimated
at 40,000.</p>

<p>45. The "Shakers," or United Society
of Believers, are a small denomination
which first made its appearance
in this country in 1776.</p>

<p>Their statistics have been as follows:</p>

<p>They are found in Maine, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, New York,
Kentucky, Connecticut.</p>

<p>46. The "Adventists," or "Second
Adventists," owe their rise in the
United States to Mr. Wm. Miller, of
Low Hampton, New York.</p>

<p>In 1859, they were estimated to
comprise about 18,000 persons, and
in 1867 about 30,000, exclusive of
members of other denominations.
Average annual increase in eight
years, 1,500.</p>

<p>47. The "New Church," or "Swedenborgians,"
accept as their rule of
faith and discipline the Holy Scriptures
as interpreted by Mr. Emanuel
Swedenborg.</p>

<p>Their numbers in the United States
have been estimated as follows:</p>


<div class="center">

<p>Average annual increase in twelve

<p>48. Modern "Spiritualism" made
its appearance in Western New York
about twenty years ago. It came at
first in the form of rappings, knockings,
table-tippings, and other noisy
demonstrations, for the purpose of attracting
general attention. The believers
held conventions and public
meetings, but adopted no form or plan
of organization. Great numbers in
all denominations are supposed to approve
more or less of their views;
but the number of separate public
adherents is estimated at 165,000.</p>

<p>49. The "Mormon Church," or
"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints," was first organized in
the town of Manchester, New York,
on April 6, 1830, by Mr. Joseph
Smith, of Vermont. The fortunes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of the church thus started have been
variable in New York, Ohio, Missouri,
and Illinois, until persecution has
compelled her to withdraw to the
wilderness of Utah. Their number
is stated to be 60,000. The average
annual increase in twenty-five years,
2,000.</p>

<p>50. Four miles from Oneida, Madison
County, New York, is located an
organized community the members
of which call themselves "Christian
Perfectionists." It was started by
Mr. John F. Noyes, a native of Brattleboro,
Vermont.</p>

<p>They have now a community in
Oneida, Wallingford, Conn., New
Haven, Conn., and New York, which
consisted of 255 members in 1867.
This is an average annual increase
of 10.</p>

<p>51. The "Catholic Apostolic
Church," or "Irvingites," originated
from the views of Mr. Edward Irving,
preached in London in 1830.</p>

<p>There are about a half-dozen of
these congregations in this country,
estimated to contain 250 members.</p>

<p>A number of small nuclei of perhaps
future denominations exists in
different states, which it is unnecessary
to mention.</p>

statistics presents the following results:</p>

<p>Thus the whole number of members
of Protestant churches in the
United States in 1867 was 6,396,110.
The average annual increase of this
membership during the preceding
twenty-five years has been 134,802.</p>

<p>The population of the United
States according to the usual census
and that of the Bureau of Statistics
for 1867, has been as follows:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="U.S. population" width="60%">

<tr><td class="tdl">1867</td><td class="tdr">36,743,198</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl" colspan="2">1870 incomplete officially.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The average annual increase in
twenty-seven years has been 728,509.</p>

<p>If we deduct from the population
of the United States in 1867 the
number of persons who were members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of Protestant churches, there
will remain 30,347,088 persons in
the United States in 1867 who were
not members of Protestant churches,
who made no public profession of
faith in their doctrines, and who did
not partake of their sacraments.</p>

<p>If we suppose the church-membership
of Protestant denominations to
increase at the same average annual
rate during the next thirty-three
years, until the year 1900, that increase
will amount to 4,448,466. If
this increase is added to the number
of church-members in 1867, the membership
of all the Protestant churches
in the year 1900 will be 10,844,576.</p>

<p>If we suppose the population of
the United States to increase in the
same average annual rate during the
next thirty-three years, until the year
1900, that increase will amount to
24,040,797. This amount added
to the population of 1867 will make
the population in 1900 reach the
number 60,784,945, of whom 49,940,419
will not be members of
any Protestant church, nor make a
public profession of faith in their doctrines,
nor partake of their sacraments.</p>

<p>It may be said that the average
annual increase of Protestantism for
twenty-five years subsequent to 1867
will be numerically greater than for
the previous twenty-five years. So will
also be numerically larger the average
annual increase of the population
for a like period, but the relative
proportion of the denominations to
the population would remain unchanged.</p>

<h2>MARY BENEDICTA.</h2>


<p>We were at school together. We
little dreamed, either of us, in those
mischief-loving days of frolic and fun,
that she was one day to be a saint,
and that I would write her story.</p>

<p>Yet look well at the face. Is there
not something like a promise of
sainthood on the pure, white brow?
And the eyes, blue-gray Irish eyes,
with the long, dark lashes throwing
a shadow underneath, "diamonds
put in with dirty fingers," have they
not a spiritual outlook that speaks to
you with a promise&mdash;a revelation of
some vision or growth of some beauty
beyond what meets your gaze?
Yet, though it seems so clear in the
retrospect, this prophetic side of her
beauty, I own it, never struck me
then.</p>

<p>I am going to tell her story simply,
with strict accuracy as to the
traits of her character&mdash;the facts of
her life and her death. I shall tell the
bad with the good, neither striving to
varnish her faults nor to heighten, by
any dramatic coloring, the beautiful
reality of her virtues. The story is
one calculated, it seems to me, to be
a light and a lesson to many. The
very faults and follies, the strange
beginning, so unlike the end, all taken
as parts of a whole in the true experience
of a soul, contain a teaching
whose sole eloquence must be its
truth and its simplicity.</p>

<p>I said we were at school together,
but, though in the same convent, we
were not in the same class. Mary
(this was her real Christian name) was
a few years older than I. Her career
at this time was one of the wildest
that ever a school-girl lived through.
High-spirited, reckless, setting all
rules at defiance, she was the torment
of her mistresses and the delight
of her companions. With the latter,
her good-nature and good temper
carried her serenely above all the
little malices and jealousies that display
themselves in that miniature
world, a school; and, at the same
time, her spirit of independence,
while it was constantly getting her
into "scrapes," was so redeemed by
genuine abhorrence of everything approaching
to meanness or deceit that
it did not prevent her being a universal
favorite with the nuns. One in
particular, who from her rigorous
disciplinarianism was the terror of us
all, was even less proof than the
others against the indomitable sweet
temper and lovableness of her rebellious
pupil. They were in a state of
permanent warfare, but occasionally,
after a hot skirmish carried on before
the public, viz., the second class,
Mother Benedicta would take the
rebel aside, and try privately to coax
her into a semblance of apology, or
mayhap a promise of amendment.
Sometimes she succeeded, for the refractory
young lady was always more
amenable to caresses than to threats,
and was, besides, notwithstanding the
war footing on which they stood,
very fondly attached to Mother Benedicta,
but she never pledged herself
unconditionally. This was a great
grievance with the mistress. She
used to argue, and threaten, and
plead by the hour, in order to induce
Mary to give her "word of
honor," as the phrase was amongst
us, that she would observe such and
such a prohibition, or obey such and
such a rule&mdash;silence was the chronic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">casus belli</i>&mdash;but all to no purpose.</p>

<p>"No, sister, I promise you to try;
but I won't promise to do or not to
do," she would answer, undefiantly,
but quite resolutely.</p>

<p>It was a common thing for Mother
Benedicta to say, after one of these
conferences which ended, as usual,
in the cautious, "I'll try, sister,"
that, if she could once get Mary to
promise her outright to mend her
ways, she would never take any more
trouble about her. "If she pledged
her word of honor to be a saint, I believe
she would keep it," observed the
nun, with a sigh.</p>

<p>I mention this little incident advisedly,
for, though at the time we,
in our wisdom, thought it must be
pure perversity on the part of our
mistress that made her so pursue
Mary on the subject, considering
that we were all in the habit of
pledging our words of honor any given
number of times a week with no particular
result, I lived to see that in
this individual instance she was guided
by prophetic insight.</p>

<p>She never succeeded, however, in
inducing Mary to commit herself
during the four years that she was
under her charge. It was war to the
end; not to the bitter end, for the strife
did not weaken, nay, it probably
strengthened the enduring attachment
that had sprung up between
them. By way of sealing irrevocably
and publicly this attachment on
her side, Mary added the nun's name
to her own, and even after she left
school she continued to sign herself
Mary Benedicta. When the time
came round for frequenting the sacraments,
it was the sure signal for a
quarrel between the two belligerents.
There was no plea or stratagem that
Mary would not have recourse to in
order to avoid going to confession.
Yet withal she had a reputation in the
school for piety&mdash;a queer, impulsive
sort of piety peculiar to herself, that
came by fits and starts. We had an
unaccountable belief in the efficacy of
her prayers, and in any difficulty she
was one of those habitually appealed
to to pray us out of it; not, indeed,
that we were actuated by any precise
view as to the spiritual quality of the
prayers, only impressed vaguely by
her general character, that whatever
she did she put her heart in and did
thoroughly. Mother Benedicta used
to say that her devotion to the Blessed
Sacrament would save her. But
this devotion consisted, as far as we
could see, in an enthusiastic love for
Benediction; and as Mary was passionately
fond of music, and confessed
a weakness for effective ceremonial,
Mother Benedicta herself occasionally
had misgivings as to how much of
the devotion went to the object of
the ceremony and how much to its
accessories, the lights, the music, and
the incense. At any rate, once over,
it exercised no apparent control over
her life. The rules of the school she
systematically ignored; the rule of
silence she looked upon with special
contempt as a bondage fit for fools,
but unworthy of rational human beings.
To the last day of her sojourn
in the school, she practically illustrated
the opinion that speech was of
gold and silence of brass, and left it
with the reputation of being the most
indefatigable talker; the most unruly
and untidy subject, but the sweetest
nature that ever tried the patience and
won the hearts of the community.</p>

<p>When she was about eighteen, her
father sent her to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sacré Cœur</span>, in
Paris, to complete her education,
which, in spite of considerable expense
on his part, and masters without
end, was at this advanced period
in a sadly retrograde state, the little
she had learned at school in Ireland
having been assiduously forgotten in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
the course of a year's anarchical
holiday, when reading of every sort
and even her favorite music were set
aside for the more congenial pastimes
of dancing, and skating, and flying
across country after the hounds.</p>

<p>I was then living in Paris, and
Mary was placed under my mother's
wing. We went to see her on the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jours de Parloir</i>, and she came to us
on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jours de Sortie</i>. But it did
not last long. As might have been expected,
the sudden change from a life
of excitement and constant out-door
exercise to one of seclusion and sedentary
habits proved too trying to
her health, and after a few months
the medical man of the convent declared
that he was not prepared to
accept the responsibility of taking
charge of her, and strongly advised
that she should be sent home.</p>

<p>We communicated this intelligence
to her father, begging at the same
time that before he came to remove
her she might be allowed to spend
a month with us. The request was
granted and Mary came to stay with
us.</p>

<p>That we might lose as little as possible
of each other's company while
we were together, she shared my
room. We spent the mornings at
home; I studying or taking my lessons,
she reading, or lolling about
the room, watching the clock, and
longing for the master to go and set
me free, that we might go out.</p>

<p>My mother, who only in a lesser
degree shared my affection for Mary,
and was anxious to make her visit as
pleasant as possible, took her about
to all the places best worth seeing
in the city&mdash;the picture-galleries, the
palaces, the museums, and the
churches. The latter, though many
of them, even as works of art, were
amongst the most interesting monuments
for a stranger, Mary seemed
thoroughly indifferent to. When
we entered one, instead of kneeling
a moment before the sanctuary, as
any Catholic does from mere force
of habit and impulse, she would
just make the necessary genuflexion,
and, without waiting for us,
hurry on round the building, examine
the pictures and the stained glass,
and then go out with as little delay
as might be. This did not strike
my mother, who was apt to remain
all the time at her prayers, while I
walked about doing the honors of
the church to Mary; but it struck
me, and it pained and puzzled me.</p>

<p>She was too innately honest to attempt
the shadow of prevarication
or <i>pose</i> even in her attitude, and her
haste in despatching the inspection
of every church we entered was so
undisguised that I saw she did not
care whether I noticed it or not.
Once, on coming out of the little
church of St. Genevieve, one of the
loveliest shrines ever raised to the
worship of God by the genius of
man, I said rather sharply to her,
for she had beaten a more precipitate
retreat than usual, and cut short
my mother's devotions at the tomb
of the saint:</p>

<p>"Mary," I said, "one really would
think the devil was at your heels the
moment you enter a church, you are
in such a violent hurry to get out of
it."</p>

<p>She laughed, not mockingly, with
a sort of half-ashamed expression,
and turning her pure, full eyes on
me.</p>

<p>"I hate to stay anywhere under
false appearances," she said, "and I
always feel such a hypocrite kneeling
before the Blessed Sacrament! I feel
as if I would choke if I stay there
over five minutes."</p>

<p>I felt shocked, and I suppose I
looked it.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me as if I were
possessed of the devil," she said, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
laughing, though there was a touch
of sadness, it struck me, in her voice
and face. "I mean to be converted
by-and-by, and mend my ways;
but meantime let me have my fun,
and, above all, don't preach to
me!"</p>

<p>"I don't feel the least inclined," I
replied.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think I'm gone beyond
it. Well, you can pray for me.
I'm not gone beyond the reach of
that!"</p>

<p>This was the only serious conversation,
if it deserves the name, that
we had during the first week of her
visit. She enjoyed herself thoroughly,
throwing all the zest of her earnest
nature into everything. The people
and their odd French ways, the shops
and their exquisite wares, the opera,
the gay Bois with the brilliant throng
of fashion that crowded round the
lake every day at the hour of promenade&mdash;the
novelty of the scene and
the place altogether enchanted her,
and there was something quite refreshing
in the spirit of enjoyment
she threw into it all.</p>

<p>One evening, after a long day of
sight-seeing, we were invited by a
friend of hers to dine at the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">table
d'hôte</i> of the Louvre. It was the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grande nouveauté</i> just then, and
Mary was consequently wild to see
it. We went, and during dinner the
admiration excited by her beauty was
so glaringly expressed by the persistent
stare of every eye within range
of her at the table that my mother
was provoked at having brought her
and exposed her to such an ordeal.
But Mary herself was blissfully unconscious
of the effect she was producing;
indeed, it would hardly be
an exaggeration to say she was unconscious
of the cause. Certainly,
no woman ever had less internal
perception or outward complacency
in her beauty than she had. This
indifference amounted to a fault, for
it pervaded her habits of dress, which
were very untidy, and betokened a
total disregard of personal appearance.
The old fault that had been
one of Mother Benedicta's standing
grievances was as strong as ever,
and it was all I could do to get her
to put on her clothes straight, and to
tie her bonnet under her chin instead
of under her ear, when she
came out with us.</p>

<p>But to return to the Louvre. It
had been settled that after dinner we
should walk across to the Palais
Royal, and let Mary see the diamond
shops illuminated, and all the
other wonderful shops; but during
dinner she overheard some one saying
that the Emperor and Empress
were to be at the Grand Opera that
night. Her first impulse was to take
a box and go there. But my mother
objected that it was Saturday, the
opera was never over before midnight,
and consequently we could
not be home and in bed before one
o'clock on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>With evident disappointment, but,
as usual, with the sweetest good temper,
Mary gave way. Her friend then
proposed that, before going to the
Palais Royal, we should walk on to
the Rue Lepelletier, and see the Emperor
and Empress going in to the
Opera. There was no difficulty in
the way of this amendment, so it was
adopted.</p>

<p>On coming out of the Louvre,
however, we found, to our surprise
and discomfiture, that the weather
had been plotting against our little
programme. The ground, which was
frozen dry and hard when we drove
down from the Champs Elysées less
than two hours before, had become
like polished glass under a heavy
fall of sleet; the horses were already
slipping about in a very uncomfortable
way, and there was a decided disinclination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
on the part of pedestrians
to trust themselves to cabs. Fate
had decreed that Mary was not to
see the Emperor on any terms that
night. It would have been absurdly
imprudent to venture on the macadam
of the boulevards, and increase
the risk of driving at all by waiting
till the streets were so slippery that
no horse could keep his footing on
them. There was nothing for it but
to go straight home, which we did,
the horse snailing at a foot-pace all
the way.</p>

<p>It was a memorable night this one
of which I am chronicling a trivial
recollection&mdash;trivial in itself, but
weighty in its consequences.</p>

<p>It was the 14th of January,
1858.</p>

<p>We went to bed, and slept, no
doubt, soundly. None the less
soundly for the thundering crash
that, before we lay down, had shaken
the Rue Lepelletier from end to end,
making the houses rock to their
foundations, shattering to pieces
every window from garret to cellar,
and reverberating along the boulevards
like the roar of a hundred
cannon. The noise shook half Paris
awake for that long night. The people,
first merely terrified, then lashed
to a frenzy of horror and of enthusiasm,
rushed from their houses, and
thronged the boulevards and the
streets in the vicinity of the Opera.
In the pitch darkness that followed
simultaneously with the bursting of
Orsini's bombs, it was impossible to
know how many were murdered or
how many wounded. There had
been a great crowd of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curieux</i> and
strangers as usual waiting to see their
majesties alight&mdash;the street was lined
with them. Were they all murdered,
blown to the four winds of heaven, in
that explosion that was loud enough
to have blown up half Paris? Of
course, popular fear and fury exaggerated
the number of the victims enormously,
and the night resounded
with the shrieks and lamentations of
women, the plunging and moaning
of horses, wounded or only frantic
with terror, and the passionate cries
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive l'Empereur!</i> intermingled
with curses on the fiends who, to
secure the murder of one man,
had sacrificed the lives of hundreds.</p>

<p>While this ghastly tumult was
scaring sleep and silence from the
city close to us, we slept on, all unconscious
of the cup of trembling to
which we had stretched out our
hand, and which had been so mercifully
snatched away from us.</p>

<p>It was only next morning, on going
out to Mass, that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">concierge</i>
stopped us to tell the news of the attempt
on the Emperor's life.</p>

<p>And we had been vexed and felt
aggrieved with the rain that drove
us home, and prevented our going
to stand amongst those <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">curieux</i> in the
Rue Lepelletier!</p>

<p>Mary did not hear of it till we
met at breakfast. I never shall forget
the look of blank horror on her
face as she listened to the account of
what had happened on the very spot
where we had been so bent on
going.</p>

<p>Although this attack of Orsini's
comes into my narrative simply as a
datum, I cannot resist making a short
digression toward it.</p>

<p>Most of my readers will remember
the singular stoicism displayed by
the Emperor at the moment of the
explosion. One of the horses was
killed under his carriage, which was
violently shaken by the plunging of
the terrified animals, and a splinter
from one of the bombs, flashing
through the window, grazed him on
the temple. In the midst of the
general panic and confusion of the
scene, the equerry rushed forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and, taking the Emperor by the arm,
cried hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Come out, sire! Come out!"</p>

<p>"Let down the steps," observed
his master with unruffled <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i>,
and quietly waited till it was done
before he moved.</p>

<p>He entered the Opera amidst deafening
cheers, and sat out the representation
as coolly, and to all appearances
with as much attention, as
if nothing had occurred to disturb
him, now and then quietly drawing
his handkerchief across the splinter-mark
on his forehead, from which
the blood was oozing slightly.</p>

<p>Next day a solemn Te Deum was
celebrated at the Tuileries. The
Empress wished the little prince,
then a baby in arms, to be present at
the thanksgiving for her own and his
father's miraculous preservation. The
child was carried into the Salle des
Maréchaux, where the court and the
Corps Diplomatique were assembled,
and immediately put out his hands,
clamoring for his father to take him.
The Emperor took him in his arms,
and the child, looking up at his face,
noticed the red mark on the temple.</p>

<p>"Papa <i>bobo</i>!"<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> he lisped, and
put up his little hand to touch it.</p>

<p>The hard, sphynx-like face struggled
for a moment; but the child's
touch had melted the strong man.
He clasped him to his heart, and
literally shook with sobs.</p>

<p>These details, which were probably
never written before, were told
to me by one who was present at
the attempt the previous night,
and at the Te Deum Mass next
day.</p>

<p>That night, when we were alone,
Mary and I talked over the diabolical
crime that had within four and
twenty hours shaken the whole country
like an earthquake, and over the
merciful interposition that had arrested
us on our way to what might
have been for us, as it was for many,
a certain and horrible death. Mary,
though she said little on this latter
point, was evidently very deeply impressed,
and what she did say carried
in it a depth of religious emotion
that revealed her to me in quite a
new light.</p>

<p>It was agreed that she would go
to confession next day, and that we
were to begin a novena together in
thanksgiving for our preservation.</p>

<p>"Mary," I said impulsively, after
we had been silent a little while,
"why have you such a dislike to go
to the sacraments? I can't understand
how, believing in them at all,
you can be satisfied to approach them
so seldom."</p>

<p>"It isn't dislike; it is <em>fear</em>," she answered.
"It's precisely because I
realize so <em>awfully</em> the power and
sanctity of the Blessed Sacrament that
I keep away. I believe so intensely
in it that, if I went often to holy
communion, I should have to divorce
from everything, to give up my whole
life to preparation and thanksgiving.
I know I should. And I don't want
to do it. Not yet, at any rate," she
added, half-unconsciously, as if speaking
to herself.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the effect her
words had on me, nor her face as
she uttered them. The night was far
spent. The emotions of the day, the
long watch, and perhaps the flickering
of our bedroom candle that was
burning low, all conspired to give an
unwonted pallor to her features that
imbued them with an almost ethereal
beauty. I always think of her now
as she sat there, in her girlish white
dressing-gown, her hands locked
resting on her knees, her head thrown
back, and her eyes looking up, so
still, as if some far beyond were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
breaking on her gaze and holding it
transfixed.</p>

<p>Nothing broke on mine. In my
dull blindness I did not see that I
was assisting at the beginning of a
great mystery, a spectacle on which
the gaze of angels was riveted&mdash;the
wrestling of a soul with God: the
soul resisting; the Creator pleading
and pursuing.</p>

<p>She left us at the end of January
to return home. We parted with
many tears, and a promise to correspond
often and pray for each other
daily.</p>

<p>For a time we did correspond very
regularly&mdash;for nearly a year. During
this period her life was an unpausing
whirl of dissipation. Balls,
visits, operas, and concerts during
the season in town were succeeded
in the country by more balls, and
hunting, and skating, and the usual
round of amusements that make up
a gay country life. Mary was everywhere
the beauty of the place, the
admired of all admirers. Strange to
say, in spite of her acknowledged
supremacy, she made no enemies.
Perhaps it would have been stranger
still if she had. Her sweet, artless
manner and perfect unconsciousness
of self went for at least as much in
the admiration she excited as her
beauty. If she danced every dance
at every ball, it was never once for
the pleasure of saying she did it, of
triumphing over other girls, but for
the genuine pleasure of the dance
itself.</p>

<p>Her success was so gratuitous, so
little the result of coquetry on her
side, that, however much it might be
envied, it was impossible to resent it.</p>

<p>I am not trying to make out a case
for Mary, or to excuse, still less justify,
the levity of the life she was leading
at this time. My only aim is to
convey a true idea of the spirit in
which she was leading it&mdash;mere exuberance
of spirits, the zest of youth
in the gay opportunities that were
showered upon her path. She was
revelling like a butterfly in flowers
and sunshine. The spirit of worldliness
in its true and worst sense did
not possess her; did not even touch
her. Its cankerous breath had not
blown upon her soul and blighted it;
the worm had not eaten into her
heart and hardened it. Both were
still sound&mdash;only drunk; intoxicated
with the wine of life. She went
waltzing through flames, like a moth
round a candle; like a child letting
off rockets, and clapping hands with
delight at the pretty blue blaze, without
fear or thought of danger. There
was no such thing as premeditated
infidelity in her mind. She was not
playing a deliberate game with God;
bidding him wait till she was ready,
till she was tired of the world and
the world of her. No, she was utterly
incapable of such a base and guilty
calculation. She had simply forgotten
that she had a soul to save. The
still, small voice that had spoken to
her in earlier days, especially on that
night of the 15th of January, stirring
the sleeping depths, and calling out
momentary yearnings toward the higher
life, had altogether ceased its pleadings.
How could that mysterious
whisper make itself heard in such a
din and clangor of unholy music?
There was no silent spot in her soul
where it could enter and find a listener.
But Mary did not think about it.
She was inebriated with youth and
joy, and had flung herself into the
vortex, and raced round with it till
her head reeled. On the surface, all
was ripple and foam, rings running
round and round; but the depths
below were sleeping. The one, the
visible hold that she retained on God
at this time was her love for his poor.
Her heart was always tender to suffering
in every form, but to the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
especially. As an instance of this, I
may mention her taking off her flannel
petticoat, on a bitter winter's day,
to give it to a poor creature whom
she met shivering at the roadside,
and then running nearly a mile home
in the cold herself.</p>

<p>After about a year our correspondence
slackened, and gradually broke
down altogether. I heard from her
once in six months, perhaps. The
tone of her letters struck me as
altered. I could not exactly say
how, except that it had grown more
serious. She said nothing of triumphs
at archery meetings or of brushes
carried off "at the death;" there
seemed to be no such feats to chronicle.
She talked of her family and
of mine, very little of herself. Once
only, in answer to a direct question
as to what books she read, she told
me that she was reading Father Faber,
and that she read very little else.
This was the only clue I gained to
the nature of the change that had
come over her.</p>

<p>At the expiration of about two
years, a clergyman, who was an old
friend of her family, and a frequent
visitor at the house, came to Paris,
and gave me a detailed account
of the character and extent of the
change.</p>

<p>The excitement into which she
had launched on returning home, and
which she had kept up with unflagging
spirit, had, as might have been
expected, told on her health, never
very strong. A cough set in at the
beginning of the winter which caused
her family some alarm. She grew
thin to emaciation, lost her appetite,
and fell into a state of general ill-health.
Change of air and complete
rest were prescribed by the medical
men. She was accordingly taken
from one sea-side place to another,
and condemned to a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> of dulness
and quiet. In a few months
the system told favorably, and she
was sufficiently recovered to return
home.</p>

<p>But the monotony of an inactive
life which was still enforced, after the
mad-cap career she had been used
to, wearied her unspeakably. For
want of something better to do, she
took to reading. Novels, of course.
Fortunately for her, ten years ago
young ladies had not taken to writing
novels that honest men blush to
review, and that too many young
ladies do not blush to read. Mary
did no worse than waste her time
without active detriment to her mind.
She read the new novels of the day,
and, if she was not much the better,
she was probably none the worse for
it. But one day&mdash;a date to be written
in gold&mdash;a friend, the same who gave
me these particulars, made her a
present of Father Faber's <i>All for Jesus</i>.
The title promised very little
entertainment; reluctantly enough,
Mary turned over the pages and began
to read. How long she read, I
cannot tell. It might be true to say
that she never left off. Others followed,
all from the same pen, through
uninterrupted days, and weeks, and
months. She told me afterward that
the burning words of those books&mdash;the
first especially, and <i>The Creator
and the Creature</i>&mdash;pursued her even in
her dreams. She seemed to hear a
voice crying after her unceasingly:
"Arise, and follow!"</p>

<p>Suddenly, but irrevocably, the
whole aspect of life was changed to
her. She began to look back upon the
near past, and wonder whether it
was she herself who had so enjoyed
those balls and gaieties, or whether
she had not been mad, and imagined
it, and was only now in her right
mind. The most insuperable disgust
succeeded to her love of worldly
amusement. She cared for nothing
but prayer and meditation, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
service of the poor and suffering. An
ardent longing took possession of her
to suffer for and with our Divine
Master. Yielding to the impulse of
her new-born fervor, she began to
practise the most rigorous austerities,
fasting much, sleeping little, and
praying almost incessantly. This was
done without the counsel or cognizance
of any spiritual guide. She
knew of no one to consult. Her
life had been spiritually so neglected
during the last two years that direction
had had no part to play in it.
There was nothing to direct. The
current was setting in an opposite direction.
The supernatural was out
of sight.</p>

<p>Under cover of her health, which,
though it was fairly recovered, still
rendered quiet and great prudence
desirable, Mary contrived to avoid
all going out, and secretly laid down
for herself a rule of life that she adhered
to scrupulously.</p>

<p>But this could not go on long. As
she grew in the ways of prayer, the
spirit of God led her imperceptibly
but inevitably into the sure and safe
high-road of all pilgrims travelling toward
the bourn of sanctity and aiming
at a life of perfection.</p>

<p>The necessity of a spiritual director
was gradually borne in upon her,
as she said to me, while at the same
time the difficulty of meeting with
this treasure, whom St. Teresa bids
us seek amongst ten thousand, grew
more and more apparent and disheartening.</p>

<p>Her father, a man of the world
and very little versed in the mysteries
of the interior life, but a good
practical Catholic nevertheless, saw
the transformation that had taken
place in his daughter, and knew not
exactly whether to be glad or sorry.
He acknowledged to her long after
that the first recognition of it struck
upon his heart like a death-knell.
He felt it was the signal for a great
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Mary opened her heart to him unreservedly,
seeking more at his hands
perhaps than any mere father in
flesh and blood could give, asking
him to point out to her the turning-point
of the new road on which she
had entered, and to help her to tread
it. That it was to be a path of
thorns in which she would need all
the help that human love could gather
to divine grace, she felt already
convinced.</p>

<p>Her father, with the honesty of an
upright heart, confessed himself inadequate
to the solving of such a
problem, and bravely proposed taking
her to London to consult Father
Faber.</p>

<p>Mary, in an ecstasy of gratitude,
threw her arms round his neck, and
declared it was what she had been
longing for for months. Father Faber
had been her guide so far; his
written word had spoken to her like
a voice from the holy mount, making
all the dumb chords of her soul
to vibrate. What would he not do
for her if she could speak to him
heart to heart, and hear the words
of prayer-inspired wisdom from his
own lips!</p>

<p>They set out in a few days for
London; but they were not to get
there. The promise that looked so
near and so precious in its accomplishment
was never to be fulfilled.
They had no sooner reached Dublin
than Mary fell ill. For some
days she was in high fever; the medical
men assured the panic-stricken
father that there was no immediate
cause for alarm; no remote cause
even, as the case then stood; the patient
was delicate, but her constitution
was good, the nervous system
sound, although shaken by the present
attack, and apparently by previous
mental anxiety. The attack itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
they attributed to a chill which had
fallen on the chest.</p>

<p>The event justified the opinion of
the physicians. Mary recovered
speedily. It was not judged advisable,
however, to let her proceed to
London. She relinquished the plan
herself with a facility that surprised
her father. He knew how ardently
she had longed to see the spiritual
guide who had already done so much
for her, and he could not forbear
asking why she took the disappointment
so coolly.</p>

<p>"It's not a disappointment, father.
God never disappoints. I don't know
why, only I feel as if the longing
were already satisfied; as if I were
not to go so far to find what I'm
looking for," she answered; and quietly
set about preparing to go back
home.</p>

<p>But they were still on the road of
Damascus. On the way home, they
rested at the house of a friend near
the Monastery of Mount Melleray.
I cannot be quite sure whether the
monks were giving a retreat for seculars
in the monastery, or whether
it was being preached in the neighboring
town. As well as I remember,
it was the latter. Indeed, I doubt
whether women would be admitted
to assist at a retreat within the monastery,
and, if not, this would be conclusive.
But of one thing I am sure,
the preacher was Father Paul, the
superior of La Trappe. I don't know
whether his eloquence, judged by the
standard of human rhetoric, was anything
very remarkable, but many witnesses
go to prove on exhaustive
evidence that it was of that kind
whose property it is to save souls.</p>

<p>To Mary it came like a summons
straight from heaven. She felt an
imperative desire to speak to him at
once in the confessional.</p>

<p>"I can give you no idea of the
exquisite sense of peace and security
that came over me the moment I
knelt down at his feet," she said, in
relating to me this stage of her vocation.
"I felt certain that I had found
the man who was to be my Father
Faber."</p>

<p>And so she had.</p>

<p>All that passes between a director
and his spiritual child is of so solemn
and sacred a nature that, although
many things which Mary confided to
me concerning her intercourse with
the saintly abbot of La Trappe might
prove instructive and would certainly
prove edifying to many interior souls,
I do not feel justified in repeating
them. If I were even not held back
by this fear of indiscretion, I should
shrink from relating these confidences,
lest I should mar the beauty or
convey a false interpretation of their
meaning. While she was speaking,
I understood her perfectly. While
listening to the wonderful experiences
of divine grace with what she
had been favored, and which she recounted
to me with the confiding simplicity
of a child, her words were as
clear and reflected her thoughts as
luminously as a lake reflects the stars
looking down into its crystal depths,
making the mirror below a faithful
repetition of the sky above. But
when I tried to write down what she
had said while it was quite fresh upon
my mind, the effort baffled me. There
was so little to write, and that little
was so delicate, so mysteriously intangible,
I seemed never to find
the right word that had come so naturally,
so expressively, to her. When
she spoke of prayer especially, there
was an eloquence, rising almost to
sublimity, in her language that altogether
defied my coarse translation,
and seemed to dissolve like a rainbow
under the process of dissection.
The most elevated subjects she was
at home with as if they had been
her natural theme, the highest spirituality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
her natural element. The writings
of St. Teresa and St. Bernard had
grown familiar to her as her catechism,
and she seemed to have caught
the note of their inspired teaching
with the mastery of sainthood. This
was the more extraordinary to me
that her intellect was by no means
of a high order. Quite the contrary.
Her taste, the whole bent of her nature,
was the reverse of intellectual,
and what intelligence she had was,
as far as real culture went, almost
unreclaimed. Her reading had been
always of the most superficial, non-metaphysical
kind; indeed, the aversion
to what she called "hard reading"
made her turn with perverse
dislike from any book whose title
threatened to be at all instructive.
She had never taken a prize at school,
partly because she was too lazy to
try for it, but also because she had
not brain enough to cope with the
clever girls of her class. Mary was
quite alive to her shortcomings in
this line, indeed she exaggerated
them, as she was prone to do most
of her delinquencies, and always spoke
of herself as "stupid." This she decidedly
was not; but her intellectual
powers were sufficiently below superiority
to make her sudden awakening
to the sublime language of mystical
theology and her intuitive perception
of its subtlest doctrines matter
of great wonder to those who
only measure man's progress in the
science of the saints by the shallow
gauge of human intellect.</p>

<p>"How do you contrive to understand
those books, Mary?" I asked
her once, after listening to her quoting
St. Bernard <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à l'appui</i> of some remarks
on the Prayer of Union that
carried me miles out of my depth.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied with
her sweet simplicity, quite unconscious
of revealing any secrets of infused
science to my wondering ears. "I
used not to understand them the
least; but by degrees the meaning
of the words began to dawn on me,
and the more I read, the better I understood.
When I come to anything
very difficult, I stop, and pray, and
meditate till the meaning comes to
me. It is often a surprise to myself,
considering how stupid I am in everything
else," she continued, laughing,
"that I should understand spiritual
books even as well as I do."</p>

<p>Those who have studied the ways
of God with his saints will not share
her surprise. In our own day, the
venerable Curé d'Ars is among the
most marvellous proofs of the manner
in which he pours out his wisdom on
those who are accounted and who
account themselves fools, not worthy
to pass muster amongst men.
But I am anticipating.</p>

<p>Her meeting with Father Paul was
the first goal in her new career, and
from the moment Mary had reached
it she felt secure of being led safely to
the end.</p>

<p>Those intervening stages were none
the less agitated by many interior
trials; doubts as to the sincerity of
her vocation; heart-sinkings as to
her courage in bearing on under the
cross that she had taken up; misgivings,
above all, as to the direction in
which that cross lay. While her
life-boat was getting ready, filling
its sails, and making out of port for
the shoreless sea of detachment and
universal sacrifice, she sat shivering;
her hand on the helm; the deep
waters heaving beneath her; the
wind blowing bleak and cold; the
near waves dashing up their spray
into her face, and the breakers further
out roaring and howling like
angry floods. There were rocks
ahead, and all round under those
foaming billows; sad havoc had
they made of many a brave little
boat that had put out to sea from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that same port where she was still
tossing&mdash;home, with its sheltering love
and care; piety enough to save any
well-intentioned soul; good example
to give and to take; good works to
do in plenty, and the body not overridden
by austerities against nature;
not starved to despondency; not exasperated
by hunger, and cold, and
endless vigils, and prayer as endless.
It was a goodly port and safe, this
home of hers. See how the deep
throws up its prey on every side!
Wrecks and spars, the shattered
remnants of bold vessels, and the
lifeless bodies of the rash crew are
everywhere strewn over the waters.
"Take heed!" they cry to her as she
counts the records one by one. "This
is an awful sea, and bold must be
the heart, and stout and iron-clad
the boat that tempts the stormy
bosom. We came, and perished.
Would that we had never left the
port!"</p>

<p>Mary never argued with the storm.
She would fall at the feet of Him
who was "sleeping below," and wake
him with the loud cry of trembling
faith, "Help me, Master, or I perish!"
and the storm subsided.</p>

<p>But when the wind and the waves
were hushed, there rose up in the
calm a voice sweet and low, but
more ruthlessly terrible to her courage
than the threatening fury of ten
thousand storms. She was her
father's oldest and darling child; she
had a brother, too, and sisters, all
tenderly loved, and cousins and
friends only less dear; she was a joy
and a comfort to many. Must she
go from them? Must she leave all
this love and all the loveliness of life
for ever?</p>

<p>Mary's vocation, notwithstanding
its strongly marked supernatural character,
was not proof against these
cruel alternations of enthusiastic
courage, and desolate heart-sinkings,
and bewildering doubts. Nay, they
were no doubt a necessary part of
its perfection. It was needful that
she should pass through the dark
watch of Gethsemani before setting
out to climb the rugged hill of Calvary.</p>

<p>All this history of her interior life
she told me <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viva voce</i> when we met. In
her letters, which were at this period
very rare and always very uncommunicative,
she said nothing whatever
of these strifes and victories.</p>

<p>But her adversaries were not all
within. A hard battle remained to
be fought with her father. His opposition
was active and relentless.
He had at first tacitly acquiesced in
her consecration to God in a religious
life of some sort; but he believed, as
every one else did, that to let her
enter La Trappe would be to consign
her to speedy and certain death; and
when she announced to him that this
was the order she had selected, and
the one which drew her with the
power of attraction, that she had
struggled in vain to resist, he declared
that nothing short of a written mandate
from God would induce him to
consent to such an act of suicide. In
vain Mary pleaded that when God
called a soul he provided all that
was necessary to enable her to answer
the call; that her health, formerly
so delicate when she was
leading a life of self-indulgence, was
now completely restored; that she
had never been so strong as since she
had lived in almost continual abstinence
(she did not eat meat on
Wednesday, Friday, or Saturday); that
the weakness of nature was no obstacle
to the power of grace, and
there are graces in the conventual life
that seculars did not dream of, nor
receive because they did not need
them.</p>

<p>In answer to these plausible arguments,
the incredulous father brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
out the laws of nature, and reason and
common sense, and the opinion of
the medical men who had attended
her in Dublin, and under whose care
she had been more or less ever since.
These men of natural science and
human sympathies declared positively
that it was neither more nor less
than suicide to condemn herself to
the rule of St. Bernard in the
cloister, where want of animal food
and warmth would infallibly kill her
before the novitiate was out. They
were prepared to risk their reputation
on the issue of this certificate.</p>

<p>Mary's exhaustive answer to all
this was that grace was always stronger
than nature; that the supernatural element
would overrule and sustain the
human one. But she pleaded in vain.
Her father was resolute. He even went
so far as to insist on her returning to
society and seeing more of the world
before she was divorced from it irrevocably.
This check was as severe as it
was unexpected. Though her disgust
to the vanities of her former life
continued as strong as ever, while
her longing for the perfect life grew
every day more intense and more
energizing, her humility made her
tremble for her own weakness.
Might not the strength that had
borne her bravely so far break down
under the attack of all her old tempters
let loose on her at once? Her
love of pleasure, that fatal enemy
that now seemed dead, might it not
rise up again with overmastering
power, and, aided by the reaction
prepared by her new life, seize her
and hold her more successfully than
ever? Yes, all this was only too
possible. There was nothing for it
but to brave her father, to defy his
authority, and to save her soul in
spite of him. She must run away
from home.</p>

<p>Before, however, putting this wise
determination into practice, it was
necessary to consult Father Paul.
His answer was what most of our
readers will suspect:</p>

<p>"Obedience is your first duty. No
blessing could come from such a violation
of filial piety. Your father is a
Christian. Do as he bids you; appeal
to his love for your soul not to tax
its strength unwisely; then trust your
soul to God as a little child trusts to
its mother. He sought you, and
pursued you, and brought you home
when you were flying from him. Is
it likely he will forsake you now,
when you are seeking after him with
all your heart and making his will
the one object of your life? Mistrust
yourself, my child. Never mistrust
God." Mary felt the wisdom
of the advice, and submitted to it in
a spirit of docility, of humble mistrust
and brave trust, and made up
her mind to go through the trial as
an earnest of the sincerity of her desire
to seek God's will, and accomplish
it in whatever way he appointed.</p>

<p>She had so completely taken leave
of the gay world for more than a
year that her reappearance at a county
ball caused quite a sensation.</p>

<p>Rumor and romance had put their
heads together, and explained after
their own fashion the motive of the
change in her life and her total seclusion
from society. Of course, it
could only be some sentimental reason,
disappointed affection, perhaps
inadequate fortune or position on
one side, and a hard-hearted father
on the other, etc. Whispers of this
idle gossip came to Mary's ears and
amused her exceedingly. She could
afford to laugh at it as there was not
the smallest shadow of reality under
the fiction.</p>

<p>Her father, whose parental weakness
sheltered itself behind the doctors
and common sense, did not exact
undue sacrifices from her. He
allowed her to continue her ascetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
rule of life unmolested, to abstain
from meat as usual, to go assiduously
amongst the poor, and to devote
as much time as she liked to prayer.
There were two Masses daily in the
village church, one at half-past six,
another at half-past seven. He made
a difficulty at first about her assisting
at them. The church was nearly
half an hour's walk from the house,
and the cold morning or night air,
as it really was, was likely to try her
severely. But after a certain amount
of arguing and coaxing Mary carried
her point, and every morning
long before daybreak sallied forth
to the village. Her nurse, who was
very pious and passionately attached
to her, went with her. Not without
hesitating, though. Every day as regularly
as they set out Malone entered
a protest.</p>

<p>"It's not natural, Miss Mary, to
be gadding out by candle-light in this
fashion, walking about the fields like
a pair of ghosts. Indeed, darlin', it
isn't."</p>

<p>The nurse was right. It certainly
was not natural, and, if Mary had
been so minded, she might have replied
that it was not meant to be;
it was supernatural. She contented
herself, however, by deprecating the
good soul's reproof and proposing to
say the rosary, a proposal to which
Malone invariably assented. So,
waking up the larks with their matin
prayer, the two would walk on briskly
to church.</p>

<p>Once set an Irish nurse to pray, and
she'll keep pace with any saint in the
calendar. Malone was not behind
with the best. The devout old soul,
never loath to begin, when once on
her knees and fairly wound up in devotion,
would go on for ever, and,
when the two Masses were over and
it was time to go, Mary had generally
to break her off in the full tide of a
litany that Malone went on muttering
all the way out of church and
sometimes finished on the road home.</p>

<p>But if she was ready to help Mary
in her praying feats, she highly disapproved
of the fasting ones, as well
as of the short rest that her young
mistress imposed on herself. Mary
confessed to me that sleep was at this
period her greatest difficulty. She
was by nature a great sleeper, and
there was a time when early rising,
even comparatively early, seemed to
her the very climax of heroic mortification.
By degrees she brought herself
to rise at a given hour, which gradually,
with the help of her angel
guardian and a strong resolve, she
advanced to five o'clock.</p>

<p>During this time of probation, her
father took her constantly into society,
to archery meetings, and regattas,
and concerts, and balls, as the
season went on. Mary did her part
bravely and cheerfully. Sometimes
a panic seized her that her old spirit
of worldliness was coming back&mdash;coming
back with seven devils to
take his citadel by storm and hold it
more firmly than ever. But she had
only to fix her eyes steadily on the
faithful beacon of the Light-house out
at sea, and bend her ear to the Life-bell
chiming its <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sursum Corda</i> far
above the moaning of the waves and
winds, and her foolish fears gave
way.</p>

<p>No one who saw her so bright and
gracious, so gracefully pleased with
everything and everybody, suspected
the war that was agitating her spirit
within. Her father wished her to
take part in the dancing, otherwise
he said her presence in the midst of
it would be considered compulsory
and her abstention be construed into
censure or gloom. Mary acquiesced
with regard to the square dances,
but resolutely declined to waltz. Her
father, satisfied with the concession,
did not coerce her further.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>So things went on for about a
year. Father Paul meantime had
had his share in the probationary action.
He knew that his patient's
health was not strong, and taking into
due account her father's vehement
and up to a certain point just representations
on the physical impossibility
of her bearing the rule of St.
Bernard, he endeavored to attract her
toward an active order, and used all
his influence to induce her to try at
any rate a less austere one before entering
La Trappe. Animated by the
purest and most ardent love for the
soul whose precious destinies were
placed under his guidance, he left nothing
undone to prevent the possibility
of mistake or ultimate regret
in her choice. He urged her to go
and see various other convents and
make acquaintance with their mode
of life. Seeing her great reluctance
to do this, he had recourse to stratagem
in order to compel her unconsciously
to examine into the spirit
and rule of several monastic houses
that he held in high esteem. One
in particular, a community of Benedictines,
I think it was, he thought
likely to prove attractive to her as
uniting a great deal of prayer with active
duties toward the poor, teaching,
etc., and at the same time of less crucifying
discipline than that of Citeaux.
He gave her a commission for the
superioress, with many excuses for
troubling her, and begging that she
would not undertake it if it interfered
with any arrangement of her own
or her father's just then.</p>

<p>Mary, never suspecting the trap
that was laid for her, made a point
of setting out to the convent at once.
The superioress, previously enlightened
by Father Paul, received her
with more than kindness, and, after
discussing the imaginary subject of
the visit, invited her to visit the chapel,
then the house, and finally, drawing
her into confidential discourse,
explained all about its spirit and manner
of life.</p>

<p>Mary, in relating this circumstance
to me, said that, though the superioress
was one of the most attractive
persons she ever met, and the convent
beautiful in its appointments,
rather than enter it she would have
preferred spending the rest of her
days in the dangers of the most worldly
life. Everything but La Trappe was
unutterably antagonistic to her. Yet,
with the exception of Mount Melleray
she had never seen even the outside
walls of a Cistercian convent, and
the fact of there not being one for
women in Ireland added one obstacle
more in the way of her entering
La Trappe.</p>

<p>When Father Paul heard the result
of this last <i>ruse</i>, he confessed the
truth to her. Noways discouraged,
nevertheless he persisted in saying
that she was much better fitted for a
life of mixed activity and contemplation
than for a purely contemplative
one, and he forbade her for a time
to let her mind dwell on the latter as
her ultimate vocation, to read any
books that treated of it, even to pray
specially that she might be led to it.
To all these despotic commands Mary
yielded a prompt, unquestioning
obedience. She was with God like
a child with a schoolmaster. Whatever
lesson he set her, she set about
learning it. Easy or difficult, pleasant
or unpleasant, it was all one to
her cheerful good-will. Why do we
not all do like her? We are all
children at school, but, instead of putting
our minds to getting our lesson
by heart, we spend the study-hour
chafing at the hard words, dog-earing
our book, and irreverently grumbling
at the master who has set us the
task. Sometimes we think in our
conceit that it is too easy, that we
should do better something difficult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
When the bell rings, we go up without
knowing a word of it, and stand
sulky and disrespectful before the
desk. We are chided, and turn back,
and warned to do better to-morrow.
And so we go on from year to year,
from childhood to youth, from youth
to age, never learning our lesson properly,
but dodging, and missing, and
beginning over and over again at
the same point. Some of us go on
being dunces to the end of our lives,
when school breaks up, and we are
called for and taken home&mdash;to the
home where there are many mansions,
but none assuredly for the
drones who have spent their school-days
in idleness and mutiny.</p>

<p>To Father Paul, the childlike submission
and humility with which Mary
met every effort to thwart her vocation
were no doubt more conclusive
proof of its solidity than the
most marked supernatural favors
would have been.</p>

<p>At last her gentle perseverance was
rewarded, grace triumphed over her
father's heart, and he expressed his
willingness to give her up to
God.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1861, we went
to stay at Versailles, and it was there
that I received from Mary the first
definite announcement of her vocation.
She wrote to me saying that,
after long deliberation and much
prayer and wise direction, she had
decided on entering a convent of
the Cistercian order. As there was
no branch of it in Ireland, she was
to come to France, and she begged
me to make inquiries as to where the
novitiate was, and to let her know
with as little delay as possible. I
will not dwell upon my own feelings
on reading this letter. I had expected
some such result, though, knowing
the state of her health, it had not occurred
to me she could have joined,
however she might have wished it,
so severe an order as that of the
founder of Citeaux.</p>

<p>I had not the least idea where the
novitiate in France was; and, as the
few persons whom I was able to
question at once on the subject seemed
to know no more about it than I
did myself, the hope flashed across
my mind that there might not be a
convent of Trappistines at all in
France. But this was not of long
duration.</p>

<p>We had on our arrival at Versailles
made the acquaintance of a young
girl whom I shall call Agnes. My
mother was already acquainted with
her parents and other members of
the family; but Agnes had either been
at school or absent visiting relations,
so from one cause or another we
had never met till now. She was
seventeen years of age, a fair, fragile-looking
girl, who reminded most people
of Schaeffer's Marguerite.</p>

<p>Agnes had a younger sister at the
Convent of La Sainte Enfance, not
far from her father's residence, and
she asked me one day to come and
see this sister and a nun that she was
very fond of. I went, and, being full
of the thought of my sweet friend in
Ireland, I immediately opened the
subject of Citeaux with the pretty
talkative little nun who came to the
parlor with Agnes's sister.</p>

<p>"What a singular chance!" she
exclaimed, when I had told as
much of my story as was necessary.
"Why, we have at this moment a
community of Cistercian nuns in the
house here! Their monastery is being
repaired, and in the meantime we
have permission from the bishop to
harbor them. See," she went on,
pointing to a row of windows whose
closed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Persiennes</i> were visible at an
angle from where we sat, "that is
where our mother has lodged them.
You can speak to the prioress, if you
like, but of course you cannot see her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>I was more struck by the strange
coincidence than overjoyed at being
so near the solution of my difficulty.
I could not, however, but take advantage
of the opportunity. Sister
Madeleine, which was the little nun's
name, ran off to ask "our mother's"
permission for me to speak with their
Cistercian sister, and in a few minutes
returned with an affirmative.</p>

<p>I was led to the door of the community-room,
and, through a little
extempore grating cut through the
panel and veiled on the inside, I
held converse with the mother abbess.</p>

<p>A few words assured me that Sister
Madeleine had been mistaken in
supposing her guests to be the daughters
of St. Bernard. They were Poor
Clares&mdash;an order more rigorous,
even, than the Trappistines; bare feet,
except when standing on a stone
pavement or in the open air, when
the rule is to slip the feet into wooden
sandals, are added to the fasting and
perpetual silence of Citeaux. Of
this latter the abbess could tell me
nothing&mdash;nothing, at least, of its actual
existence and branches in France,
though she broke out into impulsive
and loving praise of its spirit and its
saintly founder, and the rich harvest
of souls he and his children had
reaped for our Lord.</p>

<p>Here, then, was another respite.
It really seemed probable that, if, in
a quarter so likely to be well informed
on the point, there was no account
to be had of a Trappistine convent,
there could not be one in existence,
and Mary, from sheer inability to enter
La Trappe, might be driven to
choose some less terrible rule.</p>

<p>Mary meantime had set other inquirers
on the track of St. Bernard,
and soon learned that the novitiate
was at Lyons. The name of the
monastery is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notre Dame de toute
Consolation</i>.</p>

<p>After some preliminary correspondence
with the abbess, the day was
fixed for her to leave Ireland and set
out to her land of promise.</p>

<p>She came, of course, through Paris.
It was three years since we had
met. I found her greatly altered;
her beauty not gone, but changed.
She looked, however, in much better
health than I had ever seen her.
Her spirits were gone, but there had
come in their place a serenity that
radiated from her like sunshine. We
went out together to do some commissions
of hers and the better to
escape interruption, for this was in
all human probability to be our last
meeting on earth, and we had much
to say to each other.</p>

<p>We drove first to Notre Dame des
Victoires, where, at her constantly recurring
desire, I had been in the habit
of putting her name down for the
prayers of the confraternity, and we
knelt once again side by side before
the altar of our Blessed Lady.</p>

<p>From this we went to the Sacré
Cœur, where Mary was anxious to
see some of her old mistresses and
ask their prayers. Perseverance in
her vocation, and the accomplishment
of God's will in her and by her,
were the graces she was never weary
asking for herself, and imploring others
to ask for her. Her greediness
for prayers was only equalled by her
intense faith in their efficacy. She
could not resist catering for them,
and used to laugh herself at her own
importunity on this point.</p>

<p>The sister who tended the gate
gave us a cordial greeting; but, when
she heard that Mary was on her way
to La Trappe, her surprise was almost
ludicrous. If her former pupil
had said she was going to be a Mohammedan,
it could not have called
up more blank amazement than was
depicted in the good sister's face on
hearing her say that she was going
to be a Trappistine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>The mistress of schools and another
nun, who had been very kind to
her during her short stay at the Sacred
Heart, came to the parlor. I
was not present at the interview, but
Mary told me they were quite as
much amazed as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sœur portière</i>.</p>

<p>"It only shows what a character I
left behind me," she said, laughing
heartily as we walked arm in arm.
"My turning out good for anything
but mischief is a fact so miraculous
that my best friends can hardly believe
in it!"</p>

<p>It was during this long afternoon
that she told me all the details of
her vocation which I have already
narrated. She seemed transcendently
happy, and so lifted by grace above
all the falterings of nature as to be
quite unconscious that she was about
to make any sacrifice. She was tenderly
attached to her family, but the
pangs of separation from them were
momentarily suspended. Her soul
had grown strong in detachment. It
had grown to the hunger of divine
love. Like the Israelites, she had
gone out into the desert where the
manna fell, and she had fed upon it
till all other bread was tasteless to
her.</p>

<p>When I expressed surprise at seeing
her so completely lifted above
human affections, and observed that
it would save her so much anguish,
she answered quickly, with a sudden
look of pain:</p>

<p>"Oh! no it will save me none
of the suffering. That will all come
later, when the sacrifice is made.
But I always seem to have supernatural
strength given me as long as it
remains to be done. I took leave
of Father Paul and my dear old
nurse, and all the friends that flocked
to say good-by, almost without a tear.
I felt it so little that I was disgusted
with myself for being so heartless
while they were all so tender and
distressed; but when it was all over,
and the carriage had driven out on
the road, I thought my heart would
burst. I didn't dare look back at
the house, lest I should cry out to
them to take me home. And I know
this is how it will be to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And have you thought of the
possibility of having to come home
after all?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a great deal of it.
It is possible my health may fail, or
that I may have mistaken the will
of God altogether in entering La
Trappe," she answered, with a coolness
that astonished me.</p>

<p>"What a trial that would be!" I
exclaimed. "What a humiliation to
come out, after making such a stand
about entering!"</p>

<p>She laughed quite merrily.</p>

<p>"Humiliation! And what if it
were! I don't care a straw if I go
into ten convents, and come out of
them one after another, so long as I
find out the right one in the end.
What does anything signify but finding
out God's will!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the perfect
sincerity of her words. It was as
clear as sunlight&mdash;the one thing necessary,
the one thing she cared one
straw about, was finding out the will
of God. Human respect or any
petty human motive had simply gone
beyond the range of her apprehension.</p>

<p>"And the silence, Mary?" I said,
smiling, as the memory of her old
school-day troubles came back on
me. "How will you ever keep it?
To me it would be the most appalling
part of the discipline of La
Trappe."</p>

<p>"Well, is it not odd?" she replied.
"It is so little appalling to me that I
quite long for it. Sometimes I keep
repeating the words, 'Perpetual silence!'
over and over to myself, as if
they were a melody. It was it, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
think, that decided me for La Trappe
instead of Carmel, where the rule allows
them to speak during recreation.
It seems to me the hush of tongues
must be such a help to union with
God. Our tongues are so apt to
scare away his presence from our
souls."</p>

<p>We came home to dinner. While
we were alone in the drawing-room,
she asked me to play something to
her. She had been passionately fond
of the harp, and stood by me listening
with evident pleasure, and when
I was done began to draw out the
chords with her finger.</p>

<p>"Does it not cost you the least little
pang to give it up for ever&mdash;never
to hear a note of music for the rest
of your life, Mary?" I said.</p>

<p>"No, not now. I felt it in the
beginning; but the only music that
has a charm for me now is silence."</p>

<p>We parted, never to meet again,
till we meet at the judgment-seat.</p>

<p>On her arrival at Lyons, the fatigue
and emotions of the journey told
on her. An agonizing pain in the
spine to which she was subject after
any undue exertion obliged her to remain
at the hotel, lying down on the
sofa nearly all day.</p>

<p>The following morning, her father
took her to the monastery. Like
Abraham, he conducted his child to
the mount of sacrifice, and with his
own hand laid the victim on the altar;
but no angel came to snatch
away the sacrificial knife and substitute
a meaner offering for the holocaust.
He left her at the inner
gate of La Trappe.</p>

<p>She wrote to me some weeks after
her entrance.</p>

<p>"I was less brave at parting with
my beloved ones than I ought to
have been," she said; "but, on account
of the pain that kept me lying
down in the midst of them nearly all
the previous day, I had not been
able to pray as much as usual, and
so I had not got up strength enough
for the trial-time. I seemed to have
let go my hold on our Lord a little
and to be leaning on them for courage;
but, when I had been a few
hours before the Blessed Sacrament,
the pain calmed down, and I began
to realize how happy I was. I am
in great hopes that I have found the
will of God."</p>

<p>One trifling incident which gave
innocent delight to Mary I must not
omit to mention.</p>

<p>She was asked on entering what
name she wished to bear in religion,
and on her replying that she had not
thought of one and would rather the
prioress chose for her, "Then we
shall call you Mary Benedicta," said
the mother. "The saint has no name-sake
amongst us at present."</p>

<p>The only thing that disappointed
her in the new life was the mildness
of the rule and the short time it allotted
for prayer!</p>

<p>It may interest my readers and
help them to estimate the spirit of
the novice to hear some details of
the rule that struck her as too mild.</p>

<p>The Trappistines rise at 2 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>
winter and summer, and proceed to
choir, chanting the Little Office of the
Blessed Virgin. Mass, meditation, the
recital of the divine office, and household
work, distributed to each according
to her strength and aptitude
and to the wants of the community,
fill up the time till breakfast, which
is at 8. The rule relents in favor
of those who are unable to bear the
long early fast, and they are allowed
a small portion of dry bread some
hours sooner. I think the novices as
a rule are included in this dispensation.
The second meal is at 2. The
food is frugal but wholesome, good
bread, vegetables, fish occasionally,
and good, pure wine. Fire is an unknown
luxury, except in the kitchen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
The silence is perpetual, but the novices
are allowed perfect freedom of
converse with their mistress, and the
professed nuns with the abbess. They
converse occasionally during the day
amongst each other by signs. They
take open-air exercise, and perform
manual labor out-of-doors, digging,
etc. In-doors, they are constantly
employed in embroidering and mounting
vestments. Some of the most
elaborately wrought benediction-veils,
copes, chasubles, etc., used in
the large churches throughout France,
are worked by the Trappistines of
Lyons.</p>

<p>They retire to rest at 8. Their
clothing is of coarse wool, inside and
outside.</p>

<p>Mary described the material life
of La Trappe as in every sense delightful;
the digging, pealing potatoes,
and so forth, as most recreative
and not at all fatiguing. After her
first Lent, she wrote me that it had
passed so quickly, she "hardly knew
it had begun when Easter came."</p>

<p>Her only complaint was that it had
been too easy, that the austerities,
"which were at all times very mild,"
had not been more increased during
the penitential season.</p>

<p>My third letter was on her receiving
the holy habit.</p>

<p>"I wish you could see me in it,"
she said. "I felt rather odd at first,
but I soon grew accustomed to it,
and now it is so light and pleasant.
I am so happy in my vocation I cannot
help being almost sure that I
have found the will of God."</p>

<p>This was the burden of her song
for evermore: to find the will of God!
And so in prayer and expectation
she kept her watch upon the tower,
her hands uplifted, her ears and her
eyes straining night and day for every
sign and symbol of that blessed manifestation.
She kept her watch,
faithful, ardent, never weary of watching,
rising higher and higher in love,
sinking lower and lower in humility.
She had set her soul like a ladder
against the sky, and the angels were
for ever passing up and down the
rungs, carrying up the incense of the
prayer, which, as soon as it reached
the throne of the Lamb, dissolved in
graces, and sent the angels flying
down earthward again.</p>

<p>The world went on; the wheel
went round; pleasure and folly and
sin kept up their whirl with unabating
force. All things were the same
as when Mary Benedicta, hearkening
to the bell from the sanctuary, turned
her back upon the vain delusion, and
gave up the gauds of time for the
imperishable treasures of eternity.
Nothing was changed. Was it so
indeed? To our eyes it was. We
could not see what changes were to
come of it. We could not see the
work her sacrifice was doing, nor
measure the magnitude of the glory
it was bringing to God. Poor fools!
it is always so with us. We see with
the blind eyes of our body the things
that are of the body. What do we see
of the travail of humanity in God's
creation? The darkness and the pain.
Little else. We see a wicked man
or a miserable man, and we are filled
with horror or with pity. We think
the world irretrievably darkened and
saddened by the sin and the misery
that we see, forgetting the counterpart
that we do not see&mdash;the sanctity
and the beauty born of repentance
and compassion. We see the bad
publican flaunting his evil ways in
the face of heaven, brawling in the
streets and the market-place; we do
not see the good publican who goes
up to the temple striking his breast,
and standing afar off, and sobbing
out the prayer that justifies. We forget
that fifty such climbing up to
heaven make less noise than one sinner
tearing down to hell. So with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
pain. When sorrow crushes a man,
turning his heart bitter and his wine
sour, we find it hard to believe that
so much gall can yield any honey,
so much dark let in any light. We
cannot see&mdash;oh! how it would startle
us if we did&mdash;how many acts of kindness,
how many thoughts and deeds
of love, are evoked by the sight of his
distress. They may not be addressed
to him, and he may never know
of them, though he has called them
into life; they may all be spent upon
other men, strangers perhaps, to
whom he has brought comfort because
of the kindliness his sorrow had
stirred in many hearts. Some miser
has been touched in hearing the tale
of his distress, and straightway opened
his purse to help the Lazarus at
his own door. A selfish woman of
the world has foregone some bauble
of vanity and given the price to a
charity to silence the twinge that pursued
her after witnessing his patient
courage in adversity. There is no
end to the small change that one
golden coin of love, one act of heroic
faith, one chastened attitude of
Christian sorrow, will send current
through the world. It would be
easier to number the stars than to
count it all up. But the bright little
silver pieces pass through our fingers
unnoticed. We do not watch
for them, neither do we hear them
chime and ring as they drop all round
us. We do not listen for them. We
listen rather to the wailing and the
hissing, hearkening not at all to the
rustle of angels' wings floating above
the din, nor to the sound of their crystal
tears falling through the brine of
human woe and lamentation.</p>

<p>One more virgin heart is given up
to the Crucified&mdash;one more victory
won over nature and the kingdom of
this world. One more life is being
lived away to God in the silence of
the sanctuary. Who heeds it? Who
sees the great things that are coming
of it?&mdash;the graces obtained, the
blessings granted, the temptations
conquered, the miracle of compassion
won for some life-long sinner, at
whose death-bed, cut off from priest
or sacrament, the midnight watcher
before the tabernacle has been wrestling
in spirit, miles away, with
mountains and seas between them.
Only when the seven seals are broken
of the Book in which the secrets
of many hearts are written shall these
things be made manifest, and the
wonders of sacrifice revealed.</p>

<p>Mary Benedicta was drawing to
the close of her novitiate. So far her
health had stood the test bravely.
She had passed the winters without a
cough, a thing that had not happened
to her for years. The pain in her
spine that had constantly annoyed
her at home had entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Every day convinced her more
thoroughly that she had found her
true vocation, and that she was "doing
the will of God." Her profession
was fixed for the month of December.
She wrote to me a few lines, telling
me of her approaching happiness,
and begging me to get all the prayers
I could for her. Her joy seemed
too great for words. It was, indeed,
the joy that passes human understanding.
I did not hear from her again,
nor of her, till one evening I received
a letter from Ireland announcing to
me her death.</p>

<p>Till within a few days of the date
fixed for her vows, she had been to
all appearance in perfect health. She
followed the rule in its unmitigated
rigor, never asking nor seemingly
needing any dispensation. She attended
choir during the seven hours'
prayer, mental and vocal, every day.
There were no premonitory symptoms
of any kind to herald in the
messenger that was at hand. Quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
suddenly, one morning, at the first
matins, she fainted away at her place
in the choir. They carried her to
the infirmary, and laid her on a bed.
She recovered consciousness after a
short time, but on attempting to rise
fell back exhausted. The infirmarian,
in great alarm, asked if she was
suffering much. Mary smiled and
shook her head. Presently she whispered
a few words to the abbess,
who had accompanied her from the
choir, and never left her side for a
moment. It was to ask that she
might be allowed to pronounce her
vows at once.</p>

<p>Was this, then, the summons? Yes.
She was called for to go home. The
joy-bells of heaven rang out a merry
peal. The golden gates turned slowly
on their hinges. The Bridegroom
stood knocking at the door.</p>

<p>A messenger was dispatched in
haste to the archbishop for permission
to solemnize her profession at
once. Monseigneur Bonald granted
it, and sent at the same time a special
apostolic benediction to the dying
child of St. Bernard.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mary pronounced
her vows in the presence of
the Blessed Sacrament, and surrounded
by the sisterhood, weeping and
rejoicing.</p>

<p>An hour later, summoning her remaining
strength for a last act of
filial tenderness, she dictated a few
lines of loving farewell to her father.
Then she was silent, calm, and
rapt in prayer. Her eyes never
left the crucifix. The day past and
the night. She was still waiting.
At daybreak the Bridegroom entered,
and she went home with him.</p>

<h2>THE LORD CHANCELLORS OF IRELAND<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></h2>


<p>The most indefatigable student of
the history of Ireland is, at some
time or another, sure to become
wearied of, if not positively disgusted
at, the interminable series of foreign
and domestic wars, base treachery,
and wholesale massacre which unfortunately
stain the annals of that
unhappy country for nearly one thousand
years; and were it not that the
study of profane history is a duty
imposed upon us not only as an essential
part of our education, but as
a source rich in the philosophy of
human nature, there are few, we believe,
even among the most enthusiastic
lovers of their race or the most
industrious of book-worms, who would
patiently peruse the long and dreary
record of persistent oppression and
unfaltering but unavailing resistance.</p>

<p>The few centuries of pagan greatness
preceding the arrival of St.
Patrick, seen through the dim mist
of antiquity, appear to have been
periods of comparative national prosperity;
and the earlier ages of Christianity
in the island were not only in
themselves resplendent with the effulgence
of piety and learning which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>enshrouded the land and illumined
far and near the then eclipsed nations
of Europe, but were doubly brilliant
by contrast with the darkness that
subsequently followed the repeated
incursions of the merciless northern
Vikings, to whom war was a trade,
and murder and rapine the highest
of human pursuits.</p>

<p>The ultimate defeat of those barbarians
in the early part of the
eleventh century brought little or no
cessation of misery to the afflicted
people; for, with the death of the Conqueror,
the illustrious King Brian, in
the moment of victory, no man of
sufficient statesmanship or military
ability appeared who was capable
of uniting the disorganized people
under a general system of government,
or of compelling the obedience
of the disaffected and semi-independent
chiefs. The evils of the preceding
wars were numerous and
grievous. The husbandman was
impoverished, commerce had fled
the sea-ports before the dreaded
standard of the carrion Raven, learning
had forsaken her wonted abodes
for other climes and more peaceful
scenes, and even the religious establishments
which had escaped the destroyer
no longer harbored those
throngs of holy men and women
formerly the glory and benefactors of
the island. It was in this disintegrated
and demoralized condition
that the enterprising Anglo-Normans
of the following century found the
once warlike and learned Celtic
people; and as the new-comers were
hungry for land and not overscrupulous
as to how it was to be obtained,
the possession of the soil on
one side, and its desperate but unorganized
defence on the other, gave
rise to those desultory conflicts, cruel
reprisals, and horrible butcheries
which only ended, after nearly five
hundred years of strife, in the almost
utter extirpation of the original
owners.</p>

<p>Had the Norman invasion ended
with Strongbow and Henry II., or
had it been more general and successful,
as in England, the evil would
have been limited; but as every decade
poured into Ireland its hordes
of ambitious, subtle, and landless adventurers,
who looked upon Ireland
as the most fitting place to carve
their way to fame and fortune, new
wars of extermination were fomented,
and the wounds that afflicted the
country were kept constantly open.
To facilitate the designs of the new-comers,
the mass of the people were
outlawed, and the punishment for
killing a native, when inflicted, which
was seldom, was a small pecuniary
fine. The efforts of the "Reformers"
to convert by force or fraud
the ancient race and the bulk of the
descendants of the original Anglo-Normans,
who vied with each other
in their attachment to the church, perpetuated
even in a worse form the civil
strife which had so long existed between
the races, and terminated, at the
surrender of Limerick, in the complete
prostration of the nation. But it was
only for a while. The extraordinary
revival of the faith in Ireland, and
its substantial triumphs in recent
years, almost make us forget and
forgive the persecutions of "the penal
days," and not the least of these auspicious
results is the appearance of
the noble book before us, written
by a distinguished gentleman of the
legal profession of the ancient race
and religion.</p>

<p>In his voluminous work, Mr.
O'Flanagan, avoiding all matter foreign
to his subject, and touching as
lightly on wars and confiscations as
possible, while relating succinctly and
carefully the lives of the numerous
lord chancellors of Ireland, necessarily
gives us a history of English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
policy and legislation in that country
in an entirely new form, and fills up
in its historical and legal records
a hiatus long recognized on both
sides of the Atlantic. In ordinary
histories, we see broadly depicted the
effects of foreign invasion and domestic
broils: in the <cite>Lives</cite>, we are permitted
to have a view of the most
secret workings of the viceregal government
and of the managers of the
so-called Irish Parliament; of the
causes which governed British statesmen
in their treatment of the sister
kingdom, and the motive of every
step taken by the dominant faction
of the Pale, supported by the wealth
and power of a great nation, to subdue
a weak neighboring people, who,
though few in numbers, isolated and
disorganized, possessed a high degree
of civilization and a vitality that
rose superior to all defeat. The
book has also this advantage, that,
while it supplies the links that bind
causes with effects and develops in
a critical spirit the true philosophy
of history, it neither shocks our sensibilities
uselessly with the perpetual
narration of mental and physical suffering,
nor tires us with vain speculations
on what might have been had
circumstances been different. The
author is content to accept the inevitable,
and deals exclusively with the
subject in hand.</p>

<p>The partial success of Strongbow
in conjunction with the Leinster
troops induced Henry II. to project
a visit to Ireland, partly from a fear
that his ambitious subject might be
induced by the allurements of his
newly acquired greatness to forget
his pledge of fealty and allegiance,
and partly in the hope that his presence
with an armed retinue would so
overawe the native princes that their
entire submission would follow as a
matter of course. He therefore
landed at Waterford, in 1172, and
after visiting Lismore, where a provincial
synod was being held, entered
Dublin on the 11th of November of
that year. But though he remained
in that city during the greater part of
the winter, surrounded by all the
pomp of mediæval royalty, his blandishments
were only partly successful
in winning any of the prominent
chieftains to acknowledge his assumed
title of Lord of Ireland. He
rested long enough, however, to establish
a form of provincial government
for the guidance and protection
of the Anglo-Normans, and such of
the Irish of Dublin, Kildare, Meath,
Wexford, and of the surrounding
counties as acknowledged his jurisdiction,
and these became what
was long afterwards known as the
English Pale. The head of this system
was the personal representative
of the monarch, appointed and removed
at his pleasure, and called at
various times lord deputy, viceroy,
chief governor, and lord-lieutenant,
and in case of his absence or death
a temporary successor was to be
chosen by the principal nobles of the
Pale, until his return or the appointment
of his successor by the king.
In the year 1219, during the reign of
Henry III., the laws of England
were extended to the Anglo-Norman
colony, and a chancellor in the person
of John de Worchely was appointed
to assist the viceroy in the administration
of the laws and public affairs.</p>

<p>The office of chancellor, or, as he
was afterwards styled, lord high
chancellor, was known to the Romans,
and many of its peculiar duties
and powers are directly derived from
the civil law. In England, its establishment
may be considered as contemporary
with the Norman conquest,
and from the first it assumed the
highest importance in the state. "The
office of chancellor or lord keeper,"
says Blackstone, "is created by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
mere delivery of the great seal into his
custody, whereby he becomes the
first officer in the kingdom and takes
precedence of every temporal peer.
He is a privy counsellor by virtue of
his office, and, according to Lord
Ellismore, prolocutor of the House
of Lords by prescription. To him
belongs the appointment of all the
justices of the peace throughout the
kingdom. Being formerly, usually,
an ecclesiastic presiding over the
king's chapel, he became keeper of
his conscience, visitor in his right of
all hospitals and colleges of royal
foundation, and patron of all his livings
under the annual value of twenty
pounds, etc. All this exclusive of his
judicial capacity in the Court of
Chancery, wherein, as in the Exchequer,
is a common law court and a
court of equity."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In Ireland, while
the chancellor exercised the same
functions within a more contracted
sphere, his political power and duties
were more directly and frequently felt.
The viceroys, particularly those of
the early periods, were generally
soldiers expressly deputed to hold
the conquests already gained, and to
enlarge by force of arms the possessions
of the Anglo-Norman adventurers.
They were little skilled in
the arts of government, and, from
their short terms and frequent removals,
knew little of and cared less for
the people they were temporarily
sent to govern.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The chancellors,
on the contrary, were the reverse,
being from the first up to the reign
of Henry VIII., with a few exceptions,
ecclesiastics, generally men
well versed in law and letters, and
having been usually at an early age
selected from the inferior ranks of
the English clergy and promoted to
the highest positions in the church in
Ireland, as a preliminary step to their
appointment to the most important
judicial and legislative office in the
colony, they had every inducement to
become familiar with its affairs and
with the dispositions and influence
of the people among whom their lot
in life was cast. "Learned men
were those chancellors," says O'Flanagan,
"for the most part prelates of
highly cultivated minds, attached to
the land of their birth, while exercising
important sway over the destinies
of Ireland."</p>

<p>For the first two hundred years
after the creation of the office of
chancellor, very little can be gleaned
by the author of the <cite>Lives</cite>, except
the mere names, date of patents, and
a few dry facts usually connected
with well-known historical events.
The destruction by fire of St. Mary's
Abbey in Dublin, at the beginning of
the fourteenth century, and of the
Castle of Trim, in both of which valuable
public records were kept, accounts
to some extent for this paucity
of materials, while, as he says,
"others were carried out of the country,
and are met with in the State
Paper Office, the Rolls Chapel, Record
Office, and British Museum, in
London; others are at Oxford. Several
cities on the Continent possess
valuable Irish documents, while many
are stored in private houses, which
the recent commission will no doubt
render available"&mdash;a sad commentary
upon the way in which everything
relating to the history of the country
has been neglected by that government
which so frequently parades its
paternal inclinations.</p>

<p>The want of judicial business during
this period was amply compensated
for by repeated but vain efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to reconcile the different factions into
which the colonists of the Pale were
divided, and to prevent the followers
of the rival houses of Ormond and
Kildare from open warfare whenever
the slightest provocation was offered
by either side. While the power of
England was expended in foreign
wars or in the internecine struggles
of the Roses, her grasp on the dominion
of Ireland was becoming
every day more relaxed, and it was
only by the judicious pitting of one
party against another, by alternate
threats and bribes, that even the semblance
of authority could be maintained
at all times. Thus, in 1355, Edward
III., writing to the Earl of Kildare,
uses the following emphatic
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Although you know of these invasions,
destructions, or dangers, and have been
often urged to defend these marches
jointly with others, you have neither sped
thither nor sent that force of men which
you were strongly bound to have done
for the honor of an earl, and for the safety
of those lordships, castles, lands, and
tenements, which, given and granted to
your grandfather by our grandfather, have
thus descended to you. Since you neither
endeavor to prevent the perils, ruin, and
destruction threatening these parts, in
consequence of your neglect, nor attend
to the orders of ourselves or our council,
we shall no longer be trifled with," etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was strong language, but fully
justified by the unsettled condition
of affairs in and outside the Pale.
Chancellor de Wickford, Archbishop
of Dublin, who was appointed in
1375, found that his sacred calling
and official dignity were no protection
to him even in the vicinity of
the capital, and was therefore allowed
a guard of six men-at-arms and
twelve archers, while the lord treasurer
had the same number. Nor
was this precaution taken against the
Irish enemy alone, for we find that
Thomas de Burel, Prior of Kilmainham,
when chancellor, while holding
a parley with De Bermingham at
Kildare, was, with his attendant lords,
taken prisoner. The lay noblemen
were ransomed, but the prior was kept
a prisoner only to be exchanged for
one of the De Berminghams then
confined in Dublin Castle. This family
seem to have held the judicial
officers somewhat in contempt, for
we read at another time that Adam
Veldom, Chief Chancery Clerk, was
captured by them and the O'Connors,
and obliged to pay ten pounds in silver
for his release. When John Cotton,
Dean of St. Patrick's, was appointed
chancellor in 1379, and commenced
his tour, accompanied by the
viceroy, from Dublin to Cork, he
was allowed for his personal retinue,
independent of his servants and
clerks, not very formidable opponents,
it is to be presumed, "four
men-at-arms armed at all points, and
eight mounted archers," a circumstance
which shows that the Irish
and many of the Anglo-Irish of the
country had very little reverence for
the person of even an English chancellor.</p>

<p>In 1398, Dr. Thomas Cranley was
sent over to Dublin as its archbishop
and chancellor of the colony,
and from his high position and known
ability it was expected that he would
not only remedy the disorders of the
Pale, but bring back the great lords to
a sense of their duty to the king, and
devise measures for the collection of
his revenues, which these noblemen
did not seem inclined to pay with
the alacrity befitting obedient subjects.
After several years of fruitless
endeavors to effect these objects,
he was obliged to write to King Henry
IV. for funds to support his son,
who was then acting as viceroy.
"With heavy hearts," says the chancellor,
speaking for the privy council,
"we testify anew to your highness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
our lord, your son, is so destitute of
money that he has not a penny in the
world, nor can borrow a single penny,
because all his jewels and his
plate that he can spare of those that
he must of necessity have, are pledged
and be in pawn. All his soldiers
have departed from him, and the people
of his household are on the point
of leaving him." And he further significantly
adds, "For the more full declaring
of these matters to your highness,
three or two of us should have
come to your high presence, but such
is the danger on this side that not
one of us dare depart from the person
of our lord." This was indeed a sad
condition for the son of the reigning
monarch and his council to find
themselves in, while the Talbots,
Butlers, and Fitzgeralds were feasting
on the fat of the land surrounded by
thousands of their well-paid followers.
Again, in 1435, when Archbishop
Talbot was chancellor, the council
through that prelate addressed a
memorial to the king, in which the
following remarkable passage occurs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"First, that it please our sovereign
lord graciously to consider how this land
of Ireland is well-nigh destroyed and inhabited
with his enemies and rebels, insomuch
that there is not left in the northern
parts of the counties of Dublin,
Meath, Louth, and Kildare, that join together
out of subjection of the said enemies
and rebels, scarcely thirty miles in
length and twenty miles in breadth, as a
man may surely ride or go, in the said
counties, to answer to the king's writs
and to his commandments."</p></blockquote>

<p>This extraordinary admission, made
two hundred and sixty-six years after
the landing of the Normans, would
be almost incredible did it rest on
less weighty authority. This was the
time for the Irish people to have regained
their freedom, and, had they
had half as much of the spirit of nationality
and organization as they
possessed of valor and endurance,
a decisive blow might easily have
been struck that would have for ever
ended the English power in their
island. But the propitious moment
was allowed to pass, and dearly did
they pay in after-times for their supineness
and folly.</p>

<p>The dissensions were not confined
to the natives. The quarrels and
bickerings of the nobles and officials
of the Pale seemed to invite destruction.
Rival parliaments were held;
viceroys who were attached by policy
or affection to the houses of York
and Lancaster contended in the Castle
of Dublin for the legitimacy of
their respective factions; and even the
Lord Chancellor Sherwood, Bishop
of Meath, and the members of the privy
council, whose office and duty it
was to preserve the peace between all
parties, were found the most turbulent;
"the chancellor and chief-justice
of the king's bench requiring
the interposition of the king to keep
them quiet, while the Irish so pressed
upon the narrow limits of the
English settlements that the statute requiring
cities and boroughs to be represented
by inhabitants of the same
was obliged to be repealed upon the
express ground that representatives
could not be expected to encounter, on
their journeys to parliament, the great
perils incident from the king's Irish
enemies and English rebels, for it is
openly known how great and frequent
mischiefs have been done on
the ways both in the south, north,
east, and west parts, by reason whereof
they may not send proctors,
knights, nor burgesses."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Such was
the condition of Ireland in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1480,
just three centuries after the advent
of Henry II. to her shores.</p>

<p>One of the principal duties of the
Irish lord chancellors, even to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>very moment of its extinction, was
the management of the Irish parliament.
The body that for so many
centuries bore that pretentious title,
but which never spoke the voice of
even a respectable minority of the
people, is said to have owed its origin
to the second Henry, though according
to Whiteside, who follows
the authority of Sir John Davies, no
parliament was held in the country
for one hundred and forty years after
that king's visit.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Except in an
antiquarian point of view, the matter
is of little importance, as such gatherings
in Ireland, even more so than
those of England, could not at that
time be called either representative
or deliberative bodies, for their members
were not chosen by even a
moiety of the people, and they were
mere instruments in the hands of
the governing powers, who moulded
them at will when they desired to
impose new taxes or unjust laws on
the people, ostensibly with their own
sanction. From the days of Simon
de Montfort to those of George IV.,
the English parliamentary system
has been an ingeniously devised engine
of general oppression under the
garb of popular government.</p>

<p>Of the ancient parliaments, the
most famous was that held at Kilkenny
during the chancellorship of
John Trowyk, Prior of St. John, in
1367, at which was passed the statute
bearing the name of that beautiful
city. Though the name only of the
chancellor, who doubtless was the
author <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i>, has come down to
us, that delectable specimen of English
legislation is doubtless destined
to survive the changes of time, and
expire only with the language itself.
It prohibited marriage, gossipred, and
fostering between the natives and
the Anglo-Irish under penalty of
treason, also selling to the former
upon any condition horses, armor,
or victuals, under a like penalty. All
persons of either nationality living
in the Pale were to use the English
language, names, customs, dress, and
manner of riding. No Irishman was
to be admitted to holy orders, nor
was any minstrel, story-teller, or
rhymer to be harbored. English on
the borders should hold no parley
with their Irish neighbors, except by
special permission, nor employ them
in their domestic wars. Irish games
were not to be indulged in, but should
give place to those of the English,
as being more "gentlemanlike
sports." Any infraction of these provisions
was to be punished with rigor,
for, says the preamble to the
act, "many of the English of Ireland,
discarding the English tongue,
manners, style of riding, laws, and
usages, lived and governed themselves
according to the mode, fashion,
and language of the Irish enemies,"
etc., whereby the said "Irish
enemies were exalted and raised up
contrary to reason." This enactment
is perhaps without a parallel in the
history of semi-civilized legislation,
if we except that passed at a parliament
held at Trim in 1447, and for
which we are indebted to no less a
person than the Archbishop of Dublin,
lord chancellor at that period.
It enacts "that those who would be
taken for Englishmen (that is, within
the protection of law) should not
wear a beard on the upper lip; that
the said lip should be shaved once at
least in every two weeks, and that
offenders therein should be treated
as Irish enemies." As no provision
was inserted in the statute providing
for the supply of razors, or mention
made of the appointment of state
barbers, we presume it soon became
inoperative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>By such penal legislation it was
weakly supposed the evils of the
country could be cured most effectually,
but, unfortunately for the lawmakers,
it was easier to pass statutes
than to enforce them. On the mass of
the people they had no effect whatever,
except, perhaps, to bind them
faster to their ancient laws and customs,
and he would have been a bold
officer indeed who would have attempted
to carry them out, even among
the Anglo-Irish families outside of
the Pale; for we find that, at a parliament
held in Dublin in 1441, under
the supervision of Archbishop Talbot,
a strong request was made to the
king to furnish troops for the defence
of the colony, the privy council
having some time previously represented
"that the king should ordain
that the Admiral of England should,
in summer season, visit the coasts of
Ireland to protect the merchants
from the Scots, Bretons, and Spaniards,
who came thither with their
ships stuffed with men of war in
great numbers, seizing the merchants
of Ireland, Wales, and England, and
holding them to ransom."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The selfish but sagacious policy
of Henry VII. had done so much
to remedy the evils inflicted on England
by the wars of the Roses that
when his son, Henry VIII., ascended
the throne in 1509, he found a
united and contented people, a well-filled
treasury, and a subservient parliament.
The character of this notorious
ruler is too well known to
need comment, and the effects of his
crimes are still perceptibly felt by
the country that had the misfortune
to have given him birth. His influence
on Irish affairs, though more
disastrous in its immediate results,
has happily long since been obliterated.
Dr. Rokeby, Bishop of Meath,
and afterward Archbishop of Dublin,
first appointed chancellor in 1498,
was retained in his office by the new
king. He is represented as a man
of marked piety and learning, but
he would have been unfitted to fill
an office under the English crown
had he allowed any scruples of conscience
to stand between him and
the behests of his royal master.
What these were may be judged from
a passage in a private letter from
Henry to his viceroy. "Now," he
writes, "at the beginning, political
practices may do more good than
exploits of war, till such time as the
strength of the Irish enemy shall be
enfeebled and diminished; as well by
getting their captains from them, as
by putting division among them, so
that they join not together"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>&mdash;an
advice eminently suggestive, but by
no means new, for the policy of arraying
the Irish against each other
had been practised long before with
fatal effect. Rokeby held the great
seal for twenty-one years, and his
long term was marked by his successful
efforts to reconcile the hostile
Anglo-Irish factions, his negotiations
with the native chiefs, for the purpose
of inducing them to acknowledge the
sovereignty of Henry, and the consequent
extension of the functions
of the courts over the greater part
of the island. The success of the
first and last of these measures was
mainly due to the personal efforts of
the lord chancellor, and the submission
of the Irish party resulted
from the loss of the battle of Knocktough,
in 1504, and the favorable
promises held out by the chancellor
and viceroy, inducements, it is needless
to say, which were never fulfilled.
He was succeeded by the two St. Lawrences,
father and son, of whom nothing
notable is recorded, but that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>they were laymen and natives of the
soil; and by Archbishop Ingle, who,
however, held office for but one
year.</p>

<p>The next ecclesiastical chancellor
was Dr. Alan, commissioned in 1528.
This distinguished official was remarkable
not only for his great mental
capacity, but as a not unfavorable
sample of the English political churchmen
of the era immediately preceding
the so-called "Reformation"&mdash;men
who, by their laxity of faith
and worldly ambition, paved the way
for the subsequent grand march of
heresy and immorality. Born in
England in 1476, he studied with
credit both at Oxford and Cambridge,
and at an early age entered the
priesthood. His varied acquirements
and experience of mankind gained
him, in 1515, the degree of doctor
of laws and the confidence of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, then Lord
Chancellor of England, by whom he
was sent to Rome on a special mission.
On his return, he was appointed
chaplain to Cardinal Wolsey, and
judge of his legantine court. In
both capacities he appears to have
given satisfaction, particularly in the
latter, in which he materially assisted
the ambitious cardinal in suppressing
certain monasteries, and appropriating
the revenues, it is more than suspected,
to his own and his patron's
use. For these services he was rewarded
with the archbishopric of
Dublin and the Irish chancellorship.
His two great vices, avarice
and the love of intrigue, became
now fully developed. When not
begging for increase of salary or
emoluments, he was writing scandalous
letters to his friends at the English
court, complaining of the conduct
of the viceroy, the unfortunate
Earl of Kildare, and it was mainly
through his instrumentality, supported
by Wolsey, that that nobleman was
called to England and committed
to the Tower of London. His next
step was to circulate a false report
that the earl had been executed. This
led, as he anticipated, to the rebellion
of Kildare's son and deputy,
better known as Silken Thomas, and
a number of Irish chiefs with whom
the Fitzgeralds were allied, and, upon
its suppression, to the confiscation of
vast estates in Leinster and Munster.
But Alan did not live long enough
to behold the result of his sanguinary
policy. Alarmed at the storm he
had raised, he endeavored to escape
from the country, but the elements
seem to have conspired against him,
for he was cast ashore near Clontarf,
and, on being discovered by some of
Thomas's followers, he was put to
death. He was succeeded as chancellor
by Cromer, Archbishop of
Armagh, who was, however, shortly
after deprived of his office for his
unflinching opposition to Henry's absurd
pretensions of being considered
"Head of the Church." It was of
this prelate that Browne, the king's
Archbishop of Dublin, wrote to Lord
Henry Cromwell, in 1635, "that he
had endeavored, almost to the hazard
and danger of his temporal life,
to procure the nobility and gentry of
this nation to due obedience in owning
his highness their supreme head,
as well spiritual as temporal; and do
find much oppugning therein, especially
by his brother Armagh, who
hath beene the main oppugner, and
so hath withdrawn most of his suffragans
and clergy within his see and
diocese."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Unable to coerce or cajole the
Pope, Henry at length threw down
the gauntlet to the Holy Father, and,
emboldened doubtless by the ready
submission of the English, resolved
to enforce his new ideas of religion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>on the people of Ireland. The parliament
of that country, pliant as
ever, voted him king of Ireland and
head of the church, and would as
willingly have conferred on him any
other title, no matter how far-fetched
or absurd, had he desired it. Archbishop
Browne, of Dublin, was a
Christian after the king's own heart,
and, in his way, as consistent and as
zealous a reformer; and with the
chancellor, Lord Trimblestown, at
the laboring-oar, the task of converting
the Irish to the new faith was
considered quite easy. Here and
there a stubborn recusant was anticipated,
but were there not monasteries
and nunneries enough to be
confiscated, and lands and revenues
to be given away, to satisfy those benighted
adherents to the old faith?
A grand tour of proselytism throughout
the country was therefore projected,
and the lord chancellor, the
archbishop, and the other members
of the privy council sallied out, accompanied
by their men-at-arms,
procurants, clerks, and retainers, to
expound the Gospel according to
King Henry, and to enforce their
doctrines, if all else failed, by the
carnal weapons of the lash and
halter. They visited in succession
Carlow, Kilkenny, Ross, Wexford,
and Waterford, where they are mindful
to acknowledge "they were well
entertained." The archbishop on
Sundays "preached the word of God,
having very good audience, and published
the king's injunctions and the
king's translation of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater Noster</i>,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave Maria</i>, the Articles of Faith, and
the Ten Commandments in English,"
while on week-days the chancellor
took his share of the good work; for,
continues the report, "the day following
we kept the sessions there
(Waterford) both for the city and the
shire, where was put to execution
four felons, accompanied by another,
a friar, whom, among the residue, we
commanded to be hanged in his
habit, and so to remain upon the
gallows for a mirror to all his brethren
to live truly."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This judicious
mixture of preaching and hanging,
the Lord's Prayer and the statute of
Kilkenny, it was thought, would
have a salutary effect on the souls
and bodies of unbelievers, and was a
fitting form of introducing the Reformation
to the consideration of the
Irish people.</p>

<p>The war on the faith of the nation
having been thus openly and auspiciously
inaugurated, we must henceforth
look upon the chancellors of
Ireland not only as the persistent
defenders of the English interest in
that country, but as the most dangerous
because the most insidious and
influential enemies of Catholicity.</p>

<p>Sir John Alan was appointed chancellor
in 1539, and in the following
year we find him at the head of a
royal commission for the suppression
of religious houses. The authority
to the commissioners sets forth, with
a mendacity never surpassed in a
state paper, and rarely paralleled,
even in the worst days of anti-Catholic
persecution, the following pretexts
for striking a deadly blow at
the bulwarks of charity, religion, and
learning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"That from information of trustworthy
persons, it being manifestly apparent
that the monasteries, abbies, priories, and
other places of religious or regulars in
Ireland are, at present, in such a state
that in them the praise of God and the
welfare of man are next to nothing regarded,
the regulars and others dwelling
there being addicted, partly to their own
superstitious ceremonies, partly to the
pernicious worship of idols, and to the
pestiferous doctrines of the Roman Pontiff,
that unless an effectual remedy be
promptly provided, not only the weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
lower order, but the whole Irish people,
may be speedily infected to their total
destruction by the example of these persons.
To prevent, therefore, the longer
continuance of such religious men and
nuns in so damnable a state, the king,
having resolved to resume into his own
hands all the monasteries and religious
houses, for their better reformation, to remove
from them the religious men and
women, and cause them to return to some
honest mode of living, and to true
religion, directs the commissioners to
signify this his intention to the heads of
religious houses," etc.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is unnecessary to say that this
measure of wholesale spoliation was
promptly and thoroughly carried out.
The thousand ruins that dot the
island attest it, and the title-deeds of
many a nobleman's broad acres bear
date no earlier than this edict of the
greatest monster that ever disgraced
the British throne.</p>

<p>From this time forth, the lord
chancellors found their best passport
to royal favor in devising measures
for the destruction of the popular
faith. Being generally needy adventurers,
with nothing but their legal
knowledge and facile consciences to
begin the world with, they neither
loved the country nor respected the
people, and their titles and wealth
depended simply on their zeal for
Protestantism. Of the hundreds of
penal laws which disgrace the statute-book
of the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, every one of them
owes its inception and enactment to
one or another of those subtle-minded
officials who, as the head of the
lords, president of the privy council,
and the dispenser of vast judicial
and executive patronage, had a potent
influence in all public affairs.
They continued industriously to carry
out the designs of Henry during
the successive reigns of his worthy
daughter Elizabeth, the Stuarts, William,
Anne, and the House of Brunswick.
Even when the fears of foreign
invasion in 1760, and the noble resistance
of the fathers of our republic
some years later, had awakened
the fears of the British authorities
and induced them to relax somewhat
the chains of the Catholics, the voice
of the lord chancellors was still for
war. Apart, however, from this spirit
of intolerance which seemed to
be naturally attached to the office, it
must be confessed that from the days
of Henry the great seal was held by
many able lawyers and distinguished
statesmen, some of whom were not
unknown in the world of letters as
authors and liberal patrons of learning
and science. The names of
Curwan, Loftus (who founded Trinity
College University), Boyle, Porter,
Butler, Cox, Broderick, Bowles,
and many others, occupy honored
positions in the legal annals of Great
Britain and Ireland, and their lives,
full of incident and variety, are fully
and fairly placed before us by Mr.
O'Flanagan.</p>

<p>The treaty of union in 1800, by
which Ireland lost her parliament,
and legislatively became a province,
deprived the Irish chancellors of
much of their original political power;
though, strange as it may appear,
this object was effected mainly through
the exertions of Lord Clare, who at
that time held the office. In this
man's character, distinguished as it
was for many private virtues, and
for every public vice that it is possible
to conceive, were united the good
and bad qualities of all his predecessors,
joined to a wonderful mental
capacity which far surpassed them
all. Born in Ireland, he was of English
extraction and more than English
in feeling, and, though of an exemplary
Catholic stock, he was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
son of an apostate clerical student, a
most violent Protestant and a rancorous
proscriptionist. A profound jurist
and an upright judge in purely
legal matters, his anti-Catholic prejudices
seemed totally to have warped
his judgment whenever the question
of religion presented itself, and,
though a steadfast friend in private
of those who agreed with or did not
care to differ from him, he never failed
to carry into official life the hatreds
and animosities engendered in
political struggles or domestic intercourse.
A powerful orator, full of
strong legal points, logical propositions,
and keen, and sometimes coarse,
sarcasm, he ruled his party with a
rod of iron, and, when persuasion
and threats failed, he hesitated not
to use bribes and cajolery. His mental
energy was equal to any amount
of labor, and his physical courage
was beyond question, even in a
country and age where bravery was
ranked among the highest of virtues.
Such was John Fitzgibbon, first Earl
of Clare, born near Dublin in 1749,
a man pre-eminently fitted by Providence
to adorn his country and benefit
mankind, but who perverted his
great gifts and employed them with
too much success in destroying that
country's remnant of independence,
and in devising new methods of persecution
for his Catholic relatives
and countrymen. He died in the
plenitude of his power in 1802; his
name when mentioned is reprobated
by all good men in the nation he betrayed;
his title, so ingloriously won,
is extinct; and his bench in Chancery
and his seat in the House of Lords
are filled by one of that race and
creed which he so cordially detested
and so ruthlessly persecuted.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic
transit gloria mundi.</i></p>

<p>Mr. O'Flanagan brings down his
<cite>Lives</cite> to the time of George IV., but
this latter portion of his valuable collection
of biographies belongs more
to the domain of law than of history.
Indeed, the entire work is full of curious
and interesting information
which will be highly prized by the
legal profession. What the late Lord
Campbell has done so well for the
English chancellors, the author has
endeavored to do for those of Ireland,
and with equal success, notwithstanding
the scarcity of materials
and the loose manner in which the
Irish records have been kept. One
of the most attractive features of this
book is the total absence of passion
or prejudice in the narrative of events
and estimation of character; but every
necessary circumstance is detailed in
a plain, lucid, and intelligible style,
and with something of judicial gravity
and impartiality befitting so important
a subject. As far as the author's
own political predilections are
concerned&mdash;and we suspect that they
are by no means intensely national&mdash;the
tone of the book may be said to
be colorless, a peculiarity in modern
biography which, while it may detract
from its vivacity, will certainly
add much weight to its value
as an authority. We are promised
a sequel to the chancellors, containing
the lives of the lord chief-justices,
which we hope will soon appear, for
the more light that is shed on those
darkened pages of Ireland's history,
the better for the cause of truth, justice,
and humanity.</p>

<h2>GOTTFRIED VON STRASSBURG'S GREAT HYMN TO
THE VIRGIN.</h2>


<p>The period of the German Minnesinger,
dating from about the middle
of the thirteenth to the middle of
the fourteenth century, witnessed
probably the intensest and sincerest
devotion to the worship of
the Virgin Mary in the whole history
of the Catholic Church. Intense
and sincere pre-eminently, because
so expressed in the vast number of
paintings and poems in her glorification
whereof we have record. That
whole period, indeed, was one of fervent
religious feeling, stimulated by
the Crusades, and naturally choosing
the Virgin for the chief object of
worship, as the whole knightly spirit
of that age was one of devotion
to woman. The pure love&mdash;for
Minne is <em>pure</em> love&mdash;of woman has
never, in the history of literature,
been so exclusively made the topic
of poetry as it was during that century
of the Minnesinger; it is the
absorbing theme of the almost two
hundred poets of that time, of whom
we have poems handed down to us,
and its highest expression was attained
in those poems that were addressed
to the woman of all women,
Mary, the mother of Jesus.</p>

<p>The German language in the thirteenth
century had attained a development
which fitted it pre-eminently
for lyric poetry in all its branches.
What it has since gained in other
respects it has lost in sweet music of
sound. Furthermore, the true laws
of rhythm, metre, and verse for
modern languages, as distinguished
from the rules that governed classic
poetry, had been discovered and
fixed; rules and laws the knowledge
whereof subsequently was lost, and
which it gave Goethe so much trouble,
as he tells us in his autobiography,
to find again. The purity of
rhyme has never since in German
poetry attained the same degree of
perfection, not even under the skilful
hand of Rueckert and Platen,
which the Minnesinger gave to it;
and thus altogether those matters,
which constitute the mechanism of
poetry, were in fullest bloom.</p>

<p>Now this mechanism and the wonderful
language which it operated
upon being in the possession and
under the full control of such men as
were the poets of that day, the result
could be only poems of perfect
form, and yet at the same time naïve,
earnest, intense, and enthusiastic in
their character. For those poets
were not&mdash;like those of our modern
poets who have completest control of
the mechanism of poetry, as Tennyson,
Swinburne, etc.&mdash;poets of a cold,
reflective bent of mind, but they
were simple knights, with great enthusiasm
in the cause of the Crusades
and of ladies; at the same time gifted
with a wondrous power of versification.
A considerable number of
them, some of the best, as Wolfram
von Eschenbach, Ulrich von Lichtenstein,
etc., could not even write
and read, and had to dictate their
poems to their Singerlein, or sing it
to him&mdash;for these poets invented a
melody for each of their poems&mdash;which
Singerlein again transmitted
it in the same manner until, in
the course of time, these unwritten
Minnelieder were, as much as possible,
gathered together by the noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
knight, Ruediger von Manasse, his
son, and the Minnesinger, Johann
Hadlaub, put into manuscript, and
thus happily preserved for future generations.</p>

<p>The songs that these Minnesingers
sang are of a threefold character:
either in praise of the ladies, usually
coupled with references to the seasons
of the year; or of a didactic
character; or, finally, in praise of the
Virgin.</p>

<p>Their form is only twofold: either
they are lays or songs proper. The
song or Minnelied proper has invariably
a triplicity of form in each stanza,
that is, each stanza has three parts,
whereof the first two correspond with
each other exactly, whereas the third
has an independent, though of course
rhythmically connected, flow of its
own. The lay, on the contrary,
is of irregular construction, and permits
the widest rhythmical liberties.</p>

<p>Of the many Minnelieder addressed
to the Virgin we have presented
to us examples of both kinds, lays
and songs. Chief among them are
a lay by Walther von der Vogelweide,
and the <cite>Great Hymn</cite> by Gottfried
von Strassburg.</p>

<p>The latter is probably the finest
of all the Minnelieder&mdash;worldly and
sacred&mdash;of that period. Ranking
next to these two there is, however,
another poem to the Virgin, not to
be classified strictly under the general
title of Minnelieder, but still the
production of a famous Minnesinger,
and withal a poem of wondrous beauty,
which for two centuries kept its
hold upon the people. This is Konrad
von Wuerzburg's <cite>Golden Smithy</cite>&mdash;a
poem that is written in the metre
of the narrative poem of that age,
namely, in lines wherein every line
ending in a masculine rhyme has
four accentuations and every line
ending in a female rhyme has three
accentuations, the syllables not being
counted&mdash;a metre that Coleridge has
adopted in his poem <cite>Christabel</cite>.</p>

<p>In this <cite>Golden Smithy</cite> the poet represents
himself as a goldsmith, working
all manner of precious stones and
gold into a glorious ornament for the
Queen of Heaven, by gathering into
his poem all possible images and similes
from the world of nature, from
sacred and profane history and fable,
and from all the virtues and graces
of mankind. It is a poem of wonderful
splendor, and has a great
smoothness of diction. "If," says
the poet in the opening of the poem,
"in the depth of the smithy of my
heart I could melt a poem out of
gold and could enamel the gold with
the glowing ruby of pure devotion, I
would forge a transparent, shining,
and sparkling praise of thy worth,
thou glorious empress of heaven.
Yet, though my speech should fly
upward like a noble eagle, the wings
of my words could not carry me beyond
thy praise; marble and adamant
shall be sooner penetrated by a
straw, and the diamond by molten
lead, than I attain the height of the
praise that belongs to thee. Not until
all the stars have been counted
and the dust of the sun and the sand
of the sea and the leaves of the trees,
can thy praise be properly sung."</p>

<p>But even this poem is far surpassed
in beauty every way by Gottfried
von Strassburg's <cite>Great Hymn</cite>. Indeed,
Konrad himself modestly confesses
this in his <cite>Golden Smithy</cite>, when
he regrets that he does not "sit upon
the green clover bedewed with sweet
speech, on which sat worthily Gottfried
von Strassburg, who, as a most
artistic smith, worked a golden poem,
and praised and glorified the Holy
Virgin in much better strain."</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a wondrous beauty
in this hymn of Gottfried von
Strassburg, a beauty much akin to
that of his own Strassburg Cathedral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
which was begun about the same
time.</p>

<p>"It is," says Van der Hagen, "the
very glorification of love (Minne)
and of Minnesong; it is the heavenly
bridal song, the mysterious Solomon's
Song, which mirrors its miraculous
object in a stream of deep and
lovely images, linking them all together
into an imperishable wreath;
yet even here in its profundity and
significance of an artistic and numerously-rhymed
construction; always
clear as crystal, smooth and graceful."</p>

<p>The poem separates into three
parts: in the first whereof the poet
exhorts all those who desire to listen
to his song of God's great love to
endeavor to gain it by unremitting
exertion; and furthermore to pray
for him, the poet, who has so little
striven to attain it for himself. In
the second part, the poet calls upon
the heavens and Christ to bend down
and listen to his truthful lays in praise
of Christ's sweet mother. Then in
the third part begins the praise of
the Virgin, followed by that of her
Son, and the poem reaches its supreme
fervor when it breaks out finally
in praise of God himself. Thence
it gradually lowers its tone, and finally
expires in a sigh.</p>

<p>I suppose it is impossible to give
an adequate idea by translation of
the melodious sound of words, the
perfect rhythm, and the artistic gradation
of effect which this poem has
parts of the poem, and so selected
as to give a general idea of both the
manner and the matter of the poem.
The selection opens with the first
and ends with the last verses of
the whole poem; but the whole
itself being composed of ninety-four
stanzas, it was necessary to take from
in the original. I can say only that
I have done my best in the following
stanzas, selected from the various
the intermediate ones only specimens.
The imagery may often seem
far-fetched, but it must be remembered
that the men of that period likened
God and the God-begotten unto
everything on earth and in heaven,
for the simple reason that they deemed
it irreverent and impossible to
characterize them by any single predicate
or word.</p>

<p>Of the poet himself we know very
little. His name indicates him to
have been a citizen of Strassburg.
His title Meister (master) shows that
his station in life was that of a citizen
and not of a noble or knight,
their title being Herr. He was undoubtedly
the foremost poet of his
age, and&mdash;together with Wolfram
von Eschenbach&mdash;was then and is
still so considered. His greatest
work is the narrative poem, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tristan
und Isolde</i>; but that he left unfinished.
We have no other work of his
handed down to us except three or
four small Minnesongs.</p>

<h2>A WORD TO THE <cite>INDEPENDENT</cite>.</h2>


<p class="center">"A WORD TO FATHER HECKER.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We address you, Reverend Dr. Hecker,
in this public way because we recognize
in you not only the ablest defender
of the Roman Catholic Church in the
United States, but also the most progressive
and enlightened leader of thought in
that church. In the words we have to
speak, we wish to speak not to Dr. Hecker,
the antagonist of Protestantism, but to
Father Hecker, a leader of Catholicism.
We write in no polemical spirit. We have
many things against the Church of Rome,
and have spoken severely of Catholicism
as you have of Protestantism. But we have
also much veneration for many things in
that church, and a very great admiration
for some passages in its history. Enthusiastic
as you are, sir, you cannot revere
more sincerely than we the self-sacrificing
benevolence of St. Francis of Assisi, the
zeal of St. Francis Xavier, the piety of
Fénelon and of Lacordaire, the eloquence
of Bossuet and Massillon, or the courage
of Pascal and Hyacinthe.</p>

<p>"We come to you for help. In all our
great cities there are sections inhabited
almost wholly by Roman Catholic people.
It is a fact, as well known to you
as it is to us, that Catholic sections of the
cities abound in destitution, in ignorance,
in vice, in crime. Children are here
trained by all their surroundings to a life
of wickedness. In many homes they
learn profanity from the lips of their
mothers, and they are familiar with
drunkenness from their cradle, if they are
so fortunate as to have one left not pawned
to buy the means of drunkenness. We
know how many honest and hard-working
Catholics there are in these sections,
and we know how many villanous non-Catholics
there are. But you know as
well as any one knows that the Catholic
population furnishes vastly more than its
proportion of paupers and criminals. The
reform schools, the prisons, the alms-houses,
are nearly full of Catholics. In
the Catholic sections of the cities there
are drinking-saloons, dog-pits, and brothels
in abundance. The men who keep
these places are, in undue proportion,
Catholics. They receive extreme unction
on their death-beds, and are buried in
consecrated cemeteries with the rites of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the church. We say these things not to
wound your Catholic pride, nor to injure
that church, but to ask one question:
Cannot the Catholic Church herself do
something to mitigate these evils?</p>

<p>"Protestants plant missions in some of
these Catholic quarters. We are not sure
that these missions are always conducted
as they should be. Perhaps there may
be too much of a spirit of proselytism in
some of them; but, at any rate, there is
a sincere desire to make men better.
Drunkards have been reformed by these
missions. Women of evil life have been
reclaimed. Children have been taken
from vile homes and taught the ways of
virtue. Sunday-schools and reading-rooms
have been established, and have
contributed to the culture and elevation
of adults and children.</p>

<p>"But you know, sir, how strong is the
Catholic prejudice against Protestants.
Broken windows, and sometimes broken
heads, have testified to the appreciation
the Catholic population has of such
efforts on the part of Protestants. There
are whole districts from which Protestants
are practically excluded. For the
worse the lives of these people are, the
more combatively devoted are they to the
Catholic Church. Of course, we believe
that Protestantism is better than Roman
Catholicism; but since the reaching of
these people with Protestant missions is
not possible, we come to you and ask
you whether you, who have done so much
for the enlightenment of the Catholic
Church through its literature, will not lift
up your powerful voice to plead with the
church to use her almost unlimited influence
for the regeneration of her people.</p>

<p>"We are never tired of praising Catholic
charities. But Catholic charities,
like many Protestant ones, are only half-charities.
Of what avail is it that you
build a House of the Good Shepherd for
abandoned women, if you do not also take
means to mitigate the ignorance and the
wickedness of the children who are quickly
to supply the places of those whom you
have recovered?</p>

<p>"We point you to no Protestant example.
We know of none so good as that
of the illustrious St. Charles Borromeo.
If the great Cathedral of Milan were the
rudest chapel in Europe, it would yet be
one of the most glorious of temples. We
need not point the application of his example
to the present subject. If the
Catholic Church in America had one ecclesiastic
of ability who possessed half the
zeal of the illustrious successor of St.
Ambrose, this stain upon American
Catholicism might soon be wiped away.
We need not remind one so learned in
church history as yourself of his toilsome
labor in the cause of education, and of
his endeavors, which ceased only with his
life, to remove ignorance and vice from
his diocese. In suggesting to you, whose
parish has already so admirable a Sunday-school,
the good that might be accomplished
by a thoroughly organized Sunday-school
system, we do not need to suggest
that in Sunday-school work Catholics
are not imitators of Protestants. We
are proud to trace the history of Sunday-schools
to St. Charles Borromeo.</p>

<p>"By helping to improve the moral, intellectual,
and religious character of the
lower class of American Catholics, you
can do more than by all your eloquent arguments
to make Protestants think well of
the mother church. Americans are very
practical, and a good chapter of present
church history enacted before their eyes
will have more weight with them than all
the old church history your learning can
dig from the folios of eighteen centuries."</p></blockquote>

<p>We depart from our usual course
to reprint the above rather, long article,
which appeared some time ago
in the <cite>Independent</cite>, one of the leading
Protestant papers of the country,
not because of its intrinsic merits
or special untruthfulness, nor yet for
its assumed knowledge of the views
and duties of the reverend gentleman
to whom it is so pointedly addressed,
but because we consider this
a fitting time and place to answer
the invidious attacks which, under
one guise or another, are so constantly
being made on the church in
America by those who are neither
able to meet openly our arguments,
nor to arrest covertly the astonishing
progress which our holy religion is
happily making in every part of this
republic. These assaults sometimes
take the form of wholesale and mendacious
assertion and passionate appeal
to blind prejudice and unreason;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
while sometimes, like the one before
us, they assume the thin disguise of
personal courtesy and general charity
to all men. The former are perhaps
the more manly, the latter have the
merit of permitting us, without loss of
self-respect, to reply to them. The object
in either case is the same: a vain
endeavor to stem the tide of Catholicity
which, in a succession of great
waves, as it were, is fast spreading
over the land, and an attempt to make
our faith an object of aversion to those
of our countrymen not yet in the
church, by associating it with all that
is impoverished, illiterate, and immoral.</p>

<p>It is true, as the writer says, that
the Americans are a practical people;
but we are not by any means a very
reflective people, and are very apt to
judge hastily of others without sufficiently
considering the various causes
which underlie the surface of
society, or the effects which may be
produced on a people less fortunate
than ourselves by ages of misrule and
persecution. Knowing this national
failing very well, the writer in the
<cite>Independent</cite> adroitly seeks to hold the
Catholic Church responsible for the
faults and vices of a certain class of
nominal Catholics in our midst, when
he is fully aware that these very
vices, so far from being the growth
of Catholic teaching, are not only in
absolute contradiction to it, but are
the direct and logical results of an
elaborate system of penal legislation,
designed to produce the very degradation
of which he complains, and
persistently carried out to its furthest
limit by the leading Protestant power
of Europe.</p>

<p>Take New York, for instance.
Here the church is practically the
growth of but half a century. There
are some among us whose Catholic
ancestors came to this country in the
last or even in the seventeenth century;
others who have sought refuge
from the doubts and uncertainties of
Protestantism in the peaceful bosom
of mother church; but by far the greater
number are immigrants of this century,
and their children, who, glad to
flee from famine and persecution with
nothing but their lives and faith, have
sought refuge on our shores from the
tyranny of a hostile government,
which the world has long recognized
as both insincere, oppressive, and illiberal,
but which, by virtue of its assumed
leadership in the Protestant
revolt called the Reformation, wantonly
and tenaciously continued to persecute
its subjects who dared to profess
their devotion to the faith of their
fathers. Any one, be he lawyer or
laymen, who reads the penal acts of
the parliaments of England, Scotland,
and Ireland from the reign of Henry
VIII. downward, must be satisfied
that a more complete network of laws
for the purpose of beggaring, degrading,
and corrupting human nature
has never been devised. Some of
them, in fact, are almost preternatural
in their ingenuity; and the wonder is
how any class of people coming under
their operation could, for any
length of time, retain even the semblance
of civilization. Everything
that it was possible to take by legislation
from the Catholics of Great Britain
and Ireland was taken, every advantage
arising from the possession
of land or the acquisition of commercial
wealth was denied them, and the
avenues to honor and distinction
were, and are partially so to this day,
closed against them, generation after
generation. That many of the descendants
of these persecuted people
who have come among us are uneducated
is true, that they are generally
poor is a fact patent to every one;
but it ill becomes the <cite>Independent</cite> to
taunt them with their ignorance and
their poverty, knowing, as it does, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
it was Protestantism, of which it is
the expounder and the eulogist, that
has robbed them of their birthright,
and striven, with some success, it
seems, to plunge their souls in darkness.
Is it fair or generous to hold
these people up to public contumely
because of the scars they have received
in their unequalled struggle
for the freedom of conscience and
nationality; is it just or American to
try to steal from those who seek an
asylum on our soil that for which they
have imperilled and lost all else&mdash;their
faith, which is to them dearer
than life itself? Or is it more in
keeping with all our ideas of true
manhood and republican liberty that
while we extend one arm to shield
the victim of oppression, the other
should be stretched forth in reprobation
of his plunderer and persecutor?
If they have vices&mdash;and what
people have not?&mdash;let a share of the
blame at least be laid at the doors
of those who designedly and continually
debarred them from all means
of enlightenment and every incentive
to virtue, instead of being attributed
to the influence of the church.</p>

<p>And yet, in view of the gloomy history
of these people&mdash;a chapter in the
annals of England which the best of
her Protestant statesmen are endeavoring
to efface from the popular memory&mdash;the
writer in the <cite>Independent</cite>
appears to be surprised at what he
calls Catholic prejudice against Protestant
missions. No man, we are
safe in saying, has less prejudice
against his fellow-man than the
American Catholic, in all the usual
intercourse of life; but when a person
under the garb of charity invades
the sanctity of his home simply
to abuse his religion, or waylays his
children in the streets and inveigles
them into mission-houses and Sunday-schools
by the proffer of a loaf or a
jacket, for the purpose of telling them
that their fathers' faith is rank idolatry,
is it not too much to expect that
he will remain unmoved and uncomplaining?
The writer should recollect
that the class of so-called missionaries
who infest the quarters of our poorer
fellow-Catholics are not new to those
people. They have seen their counterparts
long ago in Bantry and Connemara,
in the fertile valleys of
Munster and on the bleak hills of
Connaught, in the dark days of the
great famine, when the tract distributer
followed hard on the heels
of the tithe-proctor and the bailiff,
tendering a meal or a shilling as
the price of apostasy. If heads
are occasionally broken, they are
not the heads of those who attend
to their own affairs and let their
neighbors attend to theirs, but of some
intermeddling tract-scatterer, whose
salary depends upon the number of
copies he can force into the hands
of Catholics without regard to their
wishes or feelings. The provocation
emanates from them, and they must
take the consequences. If the law
permits us to inflict summary chastisement
on the burglar who enters our
house to take our goods, shall we
have no remedy against him who
prowls about our doors to steal our
children and abuse our faith?</p>

<p>If Protestant missions were properly
conducted, they would have none
of these difficulties to contend with.
But are they properly conducted?
The writer in the <cite>Independent</cite> seems
to have some doubts on this point.
We have none. Whoever will take
the trouble to attend the Bible-classes,
prayer-meetings, day-schools, and
Sunday-schools of the Howard Mission
and its adjuncts, will be satisfied
that they are nothing but ingeniously
contrived machines for the purpose of
proselytizing Catholic children. Abuse
of Catholicity of the most unqualified
and vulgar kind forms the staple of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
instructions there from beginning to
end. Even the material relief is diverted
to this purpose. The poor
half-starved lad, as he eats his food,
swallows it down with a draught of
no-popery cant, and the ragged little
girl, as she dons some cast-off garment,
has her young mind polluted by
aspersions on the name of her whom
Holy Writ declared should be called
blessed by all nations. We have
before us a periodical issued from the
Howard Mission, under the superintendence
of a Rev. W. C. Van Meter,
which is as full of that canting,
snivelling, anti-Catholic spirit as ever
characterized the days of God-save-Barebones
or of John Wesley's unlettered
disciples. As a specimen of
the veracity of this modern apostle to
the Fourth Ward, and for the benefit
of the <cite>Independent</cite>, which has some
doubts as to whether Protestant missions
are properly conducted, we extract
the following prominent article
from its pages:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Protestantism</span> <i>vs.</i> <span class="smcap">Romanism</span>.&mdash;In
the Protestant countries of Great Britain
and Prussia, where 20 can read and write,
there are but 13 in the Roman Catholic
countries of France and Austria. In
European countries, 1 in every 10 are in
schools in the Protestant countries, and
but 1 in 124 in the Roman Catholic. In
six leading Protestant countries in Europe,
1 newspaper or magazine is published
to every 315 inhabitants; while in
six Roman Catholic there is but 1 to
every 2,715. The value of what is produced
a year by industry in Spain is $6
to each inhabitant; in France, $7½; Prussia,
$8; and in Great Britain, $31. There
are about a third more paupers in the
Roman Catholic countries of Europe
than in the Protestant, owing mainly to
their numerous holidays and prevailing
ignorance, idleness, and vice. Three
times as many crimes are committed in
Ireland as in Great Britain, though the
population is but a third. There are six
times as many homicides, four times as
many assassinations, and from three to
four times as many thefts in Ireland as
in Scotland. In Catholic Austria, there
are four times as many crimes committed
as in the adjoining Protestant kingdom
of Prussia."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Now, we ask, is the man or men
who penned and circulated this atrocious
calumny likely to command
the respect of any class of Catholics,
learned or ignorant? He or they
knew, or ought to have known, that
it contains several deliberate falsehoods.
Take, for example, the portion
of the extract relating to Great
Britain and Ireland. By referring
to the report of "Her Majesty's Inspector
of Schools, August 31, 1868,"
we find that in England and Wales
the average attendance at all the
schools in the kingdom was 1,050,120,
in Scotland 191,860, and in Ireland,
at the model schools alone, 354,853,
or nearly twice as many as in Scotland,
and, in proportion to the population,
one-seventh more than in
England. From the official report
of the statistics of crime in the same
year (the latest published reports that
have reached us), there were convicted
of crime in England 15,003, in
Scotland 2,490, and in Ireland 2,394.
Of those sentenced in England, 21
were condemned to death, 18 to penal
servitude for life, and 1,921 for a
term of years. In Scotland, one was
condemned to death, and 243 to penal
servitude, while in Ireland none
were condemned to death, and but
238 to penal servitude. We find
also that in England alone 118,390
persons are reported as belonging to the
criminal classes known to the authorities,
and but 23,041 in Ireland; and
while the former country has 20,000
houses of bad character, the latter
has 5,876. The number of paupers
in each of the three countries shows
even a greater disparity. England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>in 1868 had, exclusive of vagrants,
1,039,549, or one in every twenty
of the population; Scotland, 158,372,
or one in every 19; and Ireland,
74,254, or one in every 80!<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>If it were not foreign to our present
purpose, we could prove that the
managers of the Protestant missions
are equally untruthful in their invidious
comparisons instituted between
other countries,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> but we have shown
enough to convince any impartial
person that they are not fit to be entrusted
with the care of youth of
any class, much less of Catholic children.
If the supporters of the <cite>Independent</cite>
are sincere in their desire
to benefit the destitute, the needy,
and the vicious, let them first remove
all suspicion of proselytism from their
charities by appointing proper persons
to administer them. If they
have conscientious scruples against
co-operating with the various Catholic
charitable societies, who know
the poor and are trusted by them,
there are other ways of dispensing
their bounty judiciously than by
tampering with the poor people's
faith, and their charity will then become
a blessing to the giver as well
as to the receiver. Then let them,
above all things, advocate a fair and
impartial distribution of the public
school funds. It is well known that
the Catholics as a body are far from
being rich, and that while they are
struggling hard to sustain their own
schools, they are heavily taxed for
the support of those to which they
cannot consistently send their children,
and from which, in many instances,
the offspring of the rich alone
receive any benefit. Can we not
in this free democracy have laws regulating
education at least as equitable
as those of Austria and Prussia&mdash;countries
which we are pleased to
call despotic? Help us to the means
to educate our children in our own
way, as we have a right to do, and
you will see how the stigma of ignorance
and its consequences will be
removed from the fair forehead of
this great metropolis. We ask not
charity, we simply want our fair share
of that public money which is contributed
by Catholic and Protestant
alike for educational purposes, and
the liberty to apply it with as much
freedom from state interference as is
enjoyed in the monarchies of Europe.</p>

<p>The writer in the <cite>Independent</cite> assumes,
with a coolness approaching impertinence,
that the clergyman whom
he addresses knows that the Catholic
population "furnishes more, vastly
more, than its proportion of paupers
and criminals." He knows no such
thing, nor does any right-minded man
in the community know it. That
there are many and grave crimes committed
by nominal Catholics is, alas!
too true, but that many such are
perpetrated, to any appreciable extent,
by the hundreds of thousands of
practical Catholics in this city, no
sane man believes. Poor and ignorant,
if you will, without capital, business
training, or mechanical skill,
many thousands of our immigrants
are from necessity obliged to make
their homes in the purlieus of our
great cities. Disappointed in their too
sanguine expectation of fortune in
the New World, some seek solace in
intoxication, and in that condition
commit acts of lawlessness which their
better nature abhors. But much as
the commission of crime in any shape
is to be regretted and reprehended,
it must be admitted that most of the
offences are comparatively trivial in
their nature and consequences, and
few, even of the darkest, are the result
of premeditated villany. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
searching over the criminal records
of our state and country, we seldom
find a contrived infraction of the law
by the class to which the writer so
ungraciously alludes. A gigantic
swindle, a scientific burglary, a nicely
planned larceny, an adroit forgery, a
diabolical seduction, or a deliberate
and long-contemplated murder by
poison or the knife, is seldom committed
by that class, but by those who
were reared in as much hostility to Catholicity
as the writer of the <cite>Independent</cite>
himself. This higher grade of
crime, this "bad pre-eminence," we
might with some show of justice ascribe
to the effects of the laxity of Protestant
morals, but we have no desire
to do so here; and with even much
more truthfulness might we charge
the sects who teach that marriage is
merely a civil contract with the
responsibility of those other vices
which, striking at the very foundations
of society and the sanctity of
the family, are more lasting in their
consequences and more demoralizing
in their immediate effects, than all the
others put together. The columns
of this same virtuous <cite>Independent</cite>
have obtained an unenviable notoriety
by spreading the most shameful
and corrupting doctrines on this vital
subject. But we have no wish to
retort: the records of our divorce
courts will prove that this class of
criminals is made up almost exclusively
of non-Catholics.</p>

<p>The writer in the <cite>Independent</cite>,
throughout his appeal, assumes a
tone of superior knowledge and a
lofty contempt for details that might
mislead some into the belief that the
Catholic body of this city was an
inert and helpless mass. He asks,
"Will you not lift up your powerful
voice to plead with the church to use
her almost unlimited influence for the
regeneration of her people?" Does
the writer know, or has he attempted
to ascertain, all that the church has
done and is doing in this city, as in
every other, for the "regeneration of
her people"? If he does not, by
what right does he assume that the
voice of any one man or any number
of men is required to <em>plead</em> with the
church to do her duty? If he be
ignorant of his subject, then by what
authority does he take upon himself
the office of mediator between the
church and the people? If he be
not in ignorance, then his carefully
worded sentences and smoothly turned
compliments merely cover, without
concealing, a tissue of base insinuations,
beside which downright falsehood
were rank flattery.</p>

<p>Let him look at what the church
has done in New York in the past
generation! Forty churches and
chapels have been built, with a capacity,
it is said, to seat fifty-six thousand
persons, but really equal to the accommodation
of five times that number,
as in every church the divine
service is offered up at least three times
each Sunday, and all are attended
beyond the greatest capacity of the
building. To many of our churches
is attached a free day-school for boys
and girls, and invariably a Sunday-school&mdash;thronged
weekly by the
youth of both sexes, to listen to the
instruction and counsel of competent
teachers. Every parish has its St. Vincent
de Paul Society, counting hundreds
and in some cases thousands of
members, whose aim it is to visit the
sick, the afflicted, and the needy; and
its temperance society, the strength
of which may be judged by the long
line of stalworth men we see parading
our streets on festal occasions.
Colleges, schools, and convents there
are in great numbers for the teaching
of the higher branches of education.
Hospitals for the sick and afflicted,
asylums for the blind, the orphan,
the foundling, and the repentant sinner,
a reformatory for erring youth,
and a shelter for old age. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
every conceivable want of weak humanity
has its appropriate place of
supply among our charitable institutions.</p>

<p>All this grand system of charities
is, however, lost on the writer in the
<cite>Independent</cite>. His special attention is
directed to the "dense Catholic sections."
Well, we will take the Fourth
Ward, which is blessed with the
Howard Mission and the beneficent
supervision of Mr. Van Meter. St.
James's Church is situated in this ward,
and its parish embraces all the Protestant
missions so-called, and most
of their offshoots. Upon personal
inquiry, we find that there is erected
in this parish a magnificent and
spacious school-house, at a cost of
<i>one hundred and twenty thousand</i> dollars,
attended daily during week-days
by upwards of <i>fourteen hundred</i> boys
and girls, taught by twenty-two
teachers of both sexes. The tuition
is entirely free, the expenses amounting
to about twelve thousand dollars
annually, being sustained by the voluntary
contributions of the parishioners.
The Sunday-schools of this church
are attended by <i>twenty-five hundred</i>
children, about one-half of whom, being
employed during the week, are
unable to attend the day-schools.
Then there is an industrial school,
attended by between one and two
hundred poor children, mostly half-orphans,
who are provided with
dinner every day, and to whom are
given two entire suits of new clothing
every year, on July 4th and
Christmas Day. In addition to these
there is a branch of the St. Vincent de
Paul Society, numbering several hundred
members, forty of whom are constantly
on duty, visiting the sick,
counselling the erring, helping the
needy, and performing other works of
charity. This society alone expends
annually at least five thousand dollars.
Besides, there are two temperance
societies, numbering nearly <i>nine
hundred men</i>, who not only discourage
intemperance by their example,
but seek by weekly meetings, lectures,
and other popular attractions to win
others to follow in their footsteps.
Now, these are facts easily verified by
any one who may wish to do so, and
may be taken as a fair specimen of the
gigantic efforts which the church is
making in every parish in this city
for the conservation of the morals
and the education of her people. St.
James's Parish may be said to contain
the largest proportionate number of
our poorer brethren, who, though
heavily taxed as tenement holders
and retail purchasers of all the necessaries
of life, contributing of course
their quota to the public school fund,
can yet afford, out of their scanty and
often precarious means, to educate
and partly feed and clothe over <i>fifteen
hundred children</i>. Can the
<cite>Independent</cite> show any similar effort
on the part of any of the
sects?</p>

<p>The writer in the <cite>Independent</cite> says,
"We come to you for help." What
sort of help? If it is assistance to
prop up the decaying Protestant missions
which have so long been sources
of discord and bad feeling among
our Catholic fellow-citizens, profitable
only to their employees, we respectfully
decline: if he is in truth and
all sincerity desirous to devote a part
of his leisure time and means to improve
the condition of his less fortunate
fellow-beings in the denser
populated portions of the city, we
cannot advise him to do better than
to consult the pastor of St. James's
or of any of the churches in the
lower wards, who will give him all
the help required for the proper
disposal of both. And, in conclusion,
let us suggest to him that no
amount of politeness will justify the
violation of the commandment which
says, "Thou shalt not bear false witness
against thy neighbor."</p>

<h2>OUR LADY OF LOURDES.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF HENRI LASSERRE.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The press of Paris and of the
provinces was beginning to discuss
the events at Lourdes; and public
attention far outside the region of the
Pyrenees was gradually being attracted
to the Grotto of Massabielle.</p>

<p>The measures of the prefect were
loudly applauded by the infidel papers
and as vehemently condemned by the
Catholic ones. The latter, while
maintaining a due reserve on the subject
of the reality of the apparitions
and miracles, held that a question of
this nature should be decided by the
ecclesiastical authorities, and not
summarily settled according to the
will of the prefect.</p>

<p>The innumerable cures which
were taking place at the grotto, or
even at distant places, continually
drew an immense number of invalids
and pilgrims to Lourdes. The
Latour de Trie analysis, and the mineral
properties claimed for the new
spring by the official representative of
science, added yet more to the reputation
of the grotto, and made it attractive
even to those who depended
for their cure only on the unaided
powers of nature. Also, the discussion,
by exciting men's minds, added
to the throng of the faithful there assembled
another of the curious. All
the means adopted by the unbelievers
turned directly against the end
which they had proposed to themselves.</p>

<p>By the irresistible course of events,
then&mdash;a course fatal in the eyes of
some, but providential in those of
others&mdash;the crowd which the authorities
had been trying to disperse was
continually assuming larger and larger
proportions. And it increased the
more, because, as ill luck would have
it, the material obstacles which the
frosts of winter had produced had
gradually disappeared. The month
of May had returned; and the beautiful
spring weather seemed to invite
pilgrims to come to the grotto by all
the flowery roads which traverse the
woods, meadows, and vineyards in
this region of lofty mountains, green
hills, and shady valleys.</p>

<p>The provoked but powerless prefect
watched the growth and spread
of this peaceable and wonderful
movement, which was bringing the
Christian multitudes to kneel and
drink at the foot of a desolate
rock.</p>

<p>The measures already taken had,
it is true, prevented the grotto from
looking like an oratory, but, substantially,
the state of things remained
the same. From all sides people
were coming to the scene of a miracle.
Contrary to the hope of the
free-thinkers, the fear of the faithful,
and the expectations of all, absolutely
no disturbance or breach of the
peace occurred in this extraordinary
concourse of men and women,
old and young, believers and infidels,
the curious and the indifferent. An
invisible hand seemed to protect
these crowds from mutual collision as
they daily thronged by thousands to
the miraculous fountain.</p>

<p>The magistracy, represented by
M. Dutour, and the police, personified
in M. Jacomet, looked at this
strange phenomenon with astonishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Was their irritation all the
greater on his account? We cannot
say; but for some dispositions extremely
fond of authority, the spectacle
of a multitude so wonderfully
orderly and peaceable, is certainly
anomalous and revolutionary, if not
even insulting. When order preserves
itself, all those functionaries whose
only business is to preserve it feel a
vague uneasiness. Being accustomed
to have a hand in everything in the
name of the law, to regulate, to
command, to punish, to pardon, to
see everything and everybody depend
on their person and office, they feel
out of place in the presence of a
crowd which does not need their services,
and which gives them no pretext
for interfering, showing their importance,
and restraining its movements.
An order which excludes
them is the worst of all disorders.
If such a fatal example should be
generally followed, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureurs
impériaux</i> would no longer have a
sufficient reason for their existence,
the commissaries of police would
disappear, and even the prefectoral
splendor would begin to wane.</p>

<p>Baron Massy had indeed been
able to order the seizure of every
object deposited at the grotto; but
there was no law recognizing such
deposits as criminal, and it was impossible
to forbid or punish them.
Hence, in spite of the spoliations of
the prefect, the grotto was often brilliantly
lighted by candles, and filled
with flowers and votive offerings,
and even with silver and gold coins
contributed for the building of the
chapel which the Blessed Virgin had
required. The pious faithful wished
in this way&mdash;though it were an ineffectual
one&mdash;to show the Queen of
Heaven their good-will, zeal, and
love. "What matter is it if they do
take the money? It will have been
offered all the same. The candle
will have given its light for a time in
honor of our Mother, and the bouquet
will for an instant have perfumed
the sacred spot where her feet
rested." Such were the thoughts
of those Christian souls.</p>

<p>Jacomet and his agents continued
to come and carry everything off.
The commissary, much encouraged
after having escaped the dangers of
the 4th of May, had become very
scornful and brutal in his proceedings,
sometimes throwing the object seized
into the Gave before the scandalized
eyes of the faithful. Sometimes, however,
he was obliged in spite of himself
to leave a festal appearance at
the holy place. This was when the
ingenious piety of its visitors had
strewn the Grotto with innumerable
rose-leaves, and it was impossible for
him to pick up the thousand remains
of flowers which formed its brilliant
and perfumed carpet.</p>

<p>The kneeling crowds continued
meanwhile to pray, without making
any reply to this provoking conduct,
and let matters take their course;
showing an extraordinary patience,
such as God alone can give to an indignant
multitude.</p>

<p>One evening, the report was spread
that the emperor or his minister had
asked for the prayers of Bernadette.
M. Dutour raised a shout of triumph,
and prepared to save the state.
Three good women, who, as it
seems, had made such a statement,
were brought before the court, and
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur</i> demanded that they
should be treated according to all the
rigor of the French law. Notwithstanding
his indignant eloquence,
the judges acquitted two and condemned
the other only to a fine of five
francs. The procureur, dissatisfied
with this small amount, insisted upon
his suit, and made a desperate appeal
to the imperial court at Pau, which,
smiling at his anger, not only confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
the acquittal of the two, but also
refused to sustain the very small
judgment pronounced against the
third culprit, and dismissed the charge
altogether.</p>

<p>We mention this little occurrence,
though an insignificant one in itself,
to show how keenly the judges were
upon the watch, and how carefully
they searched for some offence, for
some opportunity to be severe, since
they employed their time in prosecuting
poor simple women whose innocence
was soon after declared by the
imperial court.</p>

<p>The people still continued quiet,
and afforded no pretext to the authorities
for making an attack upon them
in the name of the law.</p>

<p>One night, under cover of the
darkness, unknown hands tore up the
conduits of the miraculous spring,
and covered its waters with heaps of
stone, earth, and sand. Who had
raised this vile monument against the
work of God, what impious and
cowardly hands had secretly committed
such profanation, were not
known. But when the day broke,
and the sacrilege became known, a
sullen indignation, as might have been
foreseen, pervaded the multitudes who
were collected at the place, and that
day the people filled the streets and
roads in agitation like that of the
sea when it foams and roars under a
violent wind. The police, magistracy,
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergents-de-ville</i> were on the
watch, spying and listening, but they
could not report a single lawless action
or seditious word. The divine
influence which maintained order
among these enraged multitudes was
evidently invincible.</p>

<p>But who, then, was the author of
this outrage? The judges and police,
in spite of their active and zealous
endeavors, did not succeed in detecting
him. Hence it happened that
some evil-minded persons dared to
suspect the police and judiciary themselves
(though evidently with great injustice)
of having tried by this means
to produce some disorders, in order to
have an occasion to proceed with
rigor.</p>

<p>The municipal authority most earnestly
exculpated itself from all
connivance in the affair. That very
evening, or the next day, the mayor
gave orders to replace the conduits,
and to clear the floor of the grotto
of all the rubbish with which the
fountain had been obstructed. The
mayor's policy was to not assume
personally any decided position, but
to keep things as they were. He
was ready to act, but always as a
subordinate, upon the prefect's orders
and responsibility.</p>

<p>Sometimes the people, fearing that
they would not be able to control
their feelings, took precautions against
themselves. The association of stone-cutters,
numbering some four or five
hundred, had planned to make a
great but peaceful demonstration at
the grotto, and to go there in procession
singing canticles in honor of
their patron feast of the Ascension,
which came that year on the 13th of
May. But, feeling their hearts indignant
and their hands unsteady under
these proceedings of the authorities,
they distrusted themselves, and gave
up the idea. They contented themselves
with relinquishing on that day
in honor of our Lady of Lourdes the
ball they were accustomed to give
every year to conclude their festival.</p>

<p>"We intend," said they, "that no
disturbance, even though unintentional,
and no entertainment not approved
by the church, shall occur to offend
the eyes of the Holy Virgin who has
deigned to visit us."</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>The prefect perceived all the time,
more and more, that coercion of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
ordinary kind was impossible for him
on account of this surprising quietness,
this peace as irritating as it was
wonderful, which maintained itself
without exterior force in these great
collections of people. There was
not even an accident to disturb it.
He was therefore obliged either to retrace
his steps in the course which he
had thus far pursued, and to leave
the people quite alone, or to come
to open violence and persecution by
finding some pretext for the imposition
of arbitrary restraints upon them.
It was necessary either to recede or
to advance.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the variety and
suddenness of the cures which had
been worked seemed to many good
people rather poorly explained by the
therapeutic and mineral properties
ascribed to the new spring. Doubts
were raised as to the strict accuracy
of the scientific decision which had
been given by M. Latour de Trie.
A chemist of the vicinity, M. Thomas
Pugo, claimed that this water was in
no way extraordinary, and had not of
itself any healing properties whatsoever;
and in this he was sustained by
several other very capable professors
in the province. Science was beginning
to assert the entire incorrectness
of the De Trie analysis; and the rumors
to this effect had become so
strong that the municipal council of
Lourdes took cognizance of them.
The mayor could not refuse to gratify
the general desire to have a second
analysis made of the water from the
grotto. He, therefore, without consulting
the prefect (which seemed to
him useless on account of the conviction
entertained by the latter of the
accuracy of the results of M. Latour),
procured from the municipal council
a vote authorizing him to obtain a
new and definitive analysis from Prof.
Filhol, one of the principal chemists
of our day. The council at the same
time voted the funds required for the
due compensation of the celebrated
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savant</i>.</p>

<p>M. Filhol was a man of authority
in modern science, and his decision
would evidently not be open to appeal.</p>

<p>What would be the result of his
analysis? The prefect was not
chemist enough to tell; but we think
we cannot be much mistaken in
thinking that he must have been
somewhat uneasy. The verdict of
the eminent professor of chemistry
of the faculty of Toulouse might, in
fact, disturb the combinations and
plans of M. Massy. Haste was becoming
imperative, and on this
ground especially it was necessary
to fall back or press forward.</p>

<p>In the midst of such various passions
and complicated calculations,
people had not failed to subject Bernadette
to some new trials as useless
as the preceding ones.</p>

<p>She had been preparing to make
her first communion, and made it on
Corpus Christi, the 3d of June. This
was the very day on which the municipal
council of Lourdes requested
M. Filhol to analyze the mysterious
water. Almighty God, entering into
the heart of this child, made also
the analysis of a pure fount, and we
may well believe that he must have
admired and blessed, in this virginal
soul, a most pure spring and a most
transparent crystal.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the retirement in
which she preferred to hide herself,
people continued to visit her. She
was always the innocent and simple
child whose portrait we have endeavored
to present. She charmed all
those who conversed with her by her
candor and manifest good faith.</p>

<p>One day, a lady, after an interview
with her, wished, in a moment of enthusiastic
veneration easily conceivable
by those who have seen Bernadette,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to exchange her chaplet of
precious stones for that of the child.</p>

<p>"Keep your own, madam," said
she, showing her modest implement
of prayer. "You see what mine is,
and I had rather not change. It is
poor, like myself, and agrees better
with my poverty."</p>

<p>An ecclesiastic tried to make her
accept some money; she refused.
He insisted, only to be met by a
refusal so formal that a longer resistance
seemed useless. The priest,
however, did not yet consider his
case as lost.</p>

<p>"Take it," said he; "not for yourself,
but for the poor, and then you
will have the pleasure of giving an
alms."</p>

<p>"Do you, then, make it yourself
for my intention, M. l'Abbé, and that
will do better than if I should make
it myself," answered the child.</p>

<p>Poor Bernadette intended to serve
God gratuitously, and to fulfil the
mission with which she had been entrusted
without leaving her honorable
poverty. And yet she and the
family were sometimes in want of
bread.</p>

<p>At this time the salary of the prefect,
Baron Massy, was raised to
25,000 francs. Jacomet also received
a gratuity. The Minister of Public
Worship, in a letter which was communicated
to several functionaries,
assured the prefect of his perfect satisfaction,
and, while commending all
that he had so far done, he urged
him to take energetic measures, adding
that, at all costs, the grotto and
miracles of Lourdes must be put an
end to.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>On this ground, as well as on all
the others, it was necessary either to
retreat or to advance.</p>

<p>But what could be done?</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>The plan of the divine work was
gradually being developed with its admirable
and convincing logic. But at
that time no one fully recognized the
invisible hand of God directing all
the events, manifest as it was, and
M. Massy least of all. The midst
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> is not the best position
from which to judge the order of battle.
The unfortunate prefect, who
had set out upon the wrong track,
saw in what occurred only a provoking
series of unpleasant incidents and
an inexplicable fatality. If we remove
God from certain questions, we are
very likely to find in them something
inexplicable.</p>

<p>The progress of events, slow but
irresistible, was overthrowing successively
all the theses of unbelief, and
forcing this miserable human philosophy
to beat a retreat and to abandon
one by one all its intrenchments.</p>

<p>First, the apparitions had occurred.
Free thought had at the outset denied
them out-and-out, accusing the
seer of being only a tool, and of having
lent herself to carry out a deception.
This thesis had not stood before
the examination of the child,
whose veracity was evident.</p>

<p>Unbelief, dislodged from this first
position, fell back on the theory of
hallucination or catalepsy. "She
thinks she sees something; but she
does not. It is all a mistake."</p>

<p>Providence meanwhile had brought
together from the four winds its
thousands and thousands of witnesses
to the ecstatic states of the child,
and in due time had given a solemn
confirmation to the truth of Bernadette's
story by producing a miraculous
fountain before the astonished
eyes of the assembled multitudes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no fountain," was then
the word of unbelief. "It is an infiltration,
a pool, a puddle; anything
that you please, except a fountain."</p>

<p>But the more they publicly and
solemnly denied it, the more did the
stream increase, as if it had been
a living being, until it acquired prodigious
proportions. More than a
hundred thousand litres (twenty-two
thousand gallons) issued daily from
this strange rock.</p>

<p>"It is an accident; it is a freak of
chance," stammered the infidels, confounded
and recoiling.</p>

<p>Next, events following their inevitable
course, the most remarkable
cures had immediately attested the
miraculous nature of the fountain,
and given a new and decisive proof
of the divine reality of the all-powerful
apparition whose mere gesture
had brought forth this fountain of life
under a mortal hand.</p>

<p>The first move of the philosophers
was to deny the cures, as they had
before denied Bernadette's sincerity
and the existence of the fountain.</p>

<p>But suddenly these had become so
numerous and indubitable that their
opponents were obliged to take yet
another step in retreat, and admit
them.</p>

<p>"Well, granted; there are some
cures certainly, but they are natural;
the spring has some therapeutic ingredients,"
cried the unbelievers, holding
in their hands some sort of a
semblance of chemical analysis. And
then instantaneous cures, absolutely
unaccountable upon such a hypothesis,
were multiplied; and at the same
time, in various places, conscientious
and skilful chemists declared distinctly
that the Massabielle water had
not any mineral properties, that it
was common water, and that the
official analysis of M. Latour de Trie
was meant simply to please the prefect.</p>

<p>Driven in this way from all the intrenchments
in which, after their successive
defeats, they had taken refuge;
pursued by the dazzling evidence
of the fact; crushed by the
weight of their own avowals; and
not being able to take back these
successive and compulsory avowals,
publicly registered in their own newspapers,
what remained for the philosophers
and free-thinkers to do?
Only to surrender humbly to truth.
Only to bow the head, bend the knee,
and believe; only to do that which
the ripe grain does when its cells begin
to fill.</p>

<p>"The same change has taken
place," says Montaigne, "in the truly
wise, as in the stalks of wheat, which
rise up and hold up their heads erect
and proud as long as they are empty,
but, when they are full and distended
with the ripe grain, begin to
humble themselves, to bend toward
the ground. So men, when they
have tried and sounded all things,
... renounce their presumption
and recognize their natural condition."</p>

<p>Perhaps the philosophers of Lourdes
had not an intellect open or strong
enough to receive and hold the good
grain. Perhaps pride made them inflexible
and rebellious to manifest evidence.
At any rate, with the happy exception
of some who were converted,
that change did not come to them
which has come to those who are truly
wise, and they continued to keep the
lofty and proud attitude of the empty
stalks.</p>

<p>Not only did their attitude remain
thus, but their impiety, after being
disgracefully pursued from one quibble,
sophism, or falsehood to another,
and finally driven against the
wall, suddenly unmasked itself and
showed its real face. It passed, as
we may say, from the domain of
discussion and reasoning, which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
had been trying to usurp, to that of
intolerance and violence, which was
its proper home.</p>

<p>Baron Massy, who was perfectly
informed as to the state of public
feeling, understood with his rare sagacity
that, if he took arbitrary measures
and resorted to persecution, he
would have a considerable moral
support in the exasperation of the
unbelievers, who were defeated, humiliated,
and furious.</p>

<p>He also had been defeated as yet in
the contest similar to, if not exactly
the same as, theirs, which he had been
carrying on against the supernatural.
All his efforts had come to nothing.</p>

<p>The supernatural, beginning at the
base of a desolate rock and announced
only by the voice of a child, had
entered upon its course, overthrowing
all obstacles, drawing the people with
it, and gaining to itself on the way
enthusiastic acclamations, prayers,
and the cries of gratitude from the
popular faith.</p>

<p>Once more, what remained to be
done?</p>

<p>One course yet remained: to resist
evidence, and to make an attack
upon the multitude.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>In the midst of all these turns of
fortune, the question of the prefectoral
stables had become more and
more exciting, and greatly increased
the prefect's exasperation. The
month of June had come. The season
at the watering-places was beginning,
and would soon bring to
the Pyrenees bathers and tourists
from all parts of Europe, and show
them the disturbance which the supernatural
was making in the department
governed by Baron Massy. The
instructions of M. Rouland were becoming
most urgent, and pointed to
summary proceedings. On the 6th
of June, M. Fould, the Minister of
Finance, stopped at Tarbes on his
way to his summer residence, and
had a long interview with M. Massy.
It was rumored that this conference
related to the events at the grotto.</p>

<p>The act of drinking at a spring
upon the common land of the town
could not be considered as in itself
an offence against the law. The first
thing to be done by the opponents
of superstition was therefore to find
a pretext for so regarding it. Arbitrary
proceedings have not in France
the official right which they enjoy in
Russia or Turkey, but need a cover
of law.</p>

<p>The able prefect had an idea on
this subject as ingenious as it was
simple. The site of the Massabielle
Cliffs belonging to the town of
Lourdes, the mayor, as its administrator,
could prohibit any one from
visiting them, for or even without any
reason whatever, in the same way as
any private owner of land forbids at
his pleasure the trespass of others
upon it. Such a prohibition, publicly
announced, would turn each visit
to the grotto into a formal crime.</p>

<p>The plan of the baron hinged upon
this idea; and, having hit upon it, he
decided to act it out and play the
despot.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the following day,
the mayor of Lourdes was instructed
to issue the following order:</p>

<p>"The mayor of the town of Lourdes,
<i>acting under the instructions addressed
to him by the superior authorities</i>,
and under the laws of the 14th and
22d of December, 1789, of the 16th
and 24th of August, 1790, of the
19th and 22d of July, 1791, and of
the 18th of July, 1837, on Municipal
Administration;</p>

<p>"And considering that it is very
desirable, <i>in the interest of religion</i>, to
put an end to the <i>deplorable</i> scenes
now presented at the Grotto of Massabielle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
at Lourdes, on the left bank
of the Gave;</p>

<p>"Also, that <i>the care of the local public
health devolves upon the mayor</i>, and
that a great number, both of citizens
and strangers, come to draw water
from a spring in the aforesaid grotto,
<i>the water of which is suspected on good
grounds to contain mineral ingredients</i>,
making it prudent, before permitting
its use, to wait for a scientific analysis
to determine the application which
may be made of it in medicine; and,</p>

<p>"Also, that the <i>laws subject the
working of mineral springs to a preliminary
authorization by government</i>:</p>

<p>"Issues the following</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">DECREE.</p>

<p>"1. It is forbidden to draw water
at the aforesaid spring.</p>

<p>"2. It is also forbidden to pass
through the common land known as
the bank of Massabielle.</p>

<p>"3. A barrier will be put up at the
entrance to the grotto to prevent access;
and</p>

<p>"Posts will be set bearing these
words: 'It is forbidden to enter this
property.'</p>

<p>"4. All transgressions of this decree
will be prosecuted according to law.</p>

<p>"5. The Commissary of Police,</p>

<p>"The Gendarmerie,</p>

<p>"The Gardes Champêtres,</p>

<p>"And the authorities of the commune,</p>

<p>"Are entrusted with the execution
of this decree.</p>

<p>"Signed in the mayor's office at
Lourdes, on the 8th of June, 1858.</p>


<p class="signature">"The Mayor, <span class="smcap">A. Lacadé</span>.</p>


<p>"Approved:</p>


<p class="signature">"The Prefect, <span class="smcap">O. Massy</span>"
</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">X.</p>

<p>It was not without some hesitation
that M. Lacadé consented to sign
and undertake to execute this decree.
His character, somewhat wanting in
decision and inclined to compromise,
necessarily disinclined him to such a
manifest act of hostility against the
mysterious power which hovered invisibly
over the events which had
centred round the grotto at Lourdes.
On the other hand, the mayor, as
was very proper, enjoyed the exercise
of his office, and perhaps had
even a little undue fondness for it;
and his alternative was either to become
the instrument of the prefectoral
violence or to resign the honors
of the mayoralty. Although perhaps
not really trying, the situation
was certainly embarrassing for
the chief-magistrate of Lourdes. M.
Lacadé hoped, however, to conciliate
all parties by requiring M. Massy, as
a condition of his signature, to insert
at the head of the decree, at the very
outset, the words, "Acting under the
instructions addressed to him by the
superior authorities," as above.</p>

<p>"In this way," said the mayor to
himself, "I assume no responsibility
before the public or in my own eyes.
I have not taken the initiative, but
remain neutral. I do not command,
but only obey. I do not give this
order, but receive it. I am not the
author of this decree, I only execute
it. All the blame rests upon my immediate
superior, the prefect."</p>

<p>Coming from a soldier in a regiment
drawn up for battle, such reasoning
would have been irreproachable.</p>

<p>Having reassured himself on this
principle, M. Lacadé took measures
for the execution of the prefectoral
edict, having it published and put on
the walls in all parts of the town. At
the same time, under the protection
of an armed force and the direction
of Jacomet, barriers were put up
around the Massabielle rocks, so that
no one, except by breaking through
or climbing over them, could reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
the grotto and the miraculous fountain.
Posts with notices, as prescribed
by the decree, were also set up
here and there at all points of entrance
to the common land which
surrounded the venerable spot. They
prohibited trespass under pain of
prosecution. Some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sergents-de-ville</i>
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gardes</i> kept watch day and night,
being relieved hourly, to prepare <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbaux</i>
against all who should
pass these posts to kneel in the vicinity
of the grotto.</p>


<p class="center">XI.</p>

<p>There was at Lourdes a judge of
the name of Duprat, who was as
violently opposed to the supernatural
as Jacomet, Massy, Dutour, and
others of the constituted authorities.
This judge, not being able under the
circumstances to sentence the delinquents
to anything more than a very
small fine, contrived an indirect
method to make the fine enormous
and truly formidable for the poor
people who came to pray before the
grotto, and to beg from the Blessed
Virgin, one the restoration of health,
another the cure of a darling child,
a third some spiritual favor or consolation
under some great affliction.</p>

<p>M. Duprat then imposed upon
each offender a fine of five francs.
But, by a conception worthy of his
genius, he united under a single sentence
all who disregarded the prefectoral
prohibition, either by forming a
party together, or even, as it would
seem, by visiting the grotto in the
course of the same day; and he
made each liable to the whole
amount of the fine. Thus, if one or
two hundred persons came in this
way to the rocks of Massabielle, each
one of them was responsible not only
for himself, but also for the others,
that is, to the extent of five hundred
or a thousand francs. And as the
individual and original fine was only
five francs, the decision of this magistrate
was without appeal, and
there was no way to correct it.
Judge Duprat was all-powerful, and
it was thus that he used his power.</p>


<p class="center">XII.</p>

<p>Such an outrageous interference in
the important question which had
for some months been pending on
the banks of the Gave implied on
the part of the authorities not only
the denial of the supernatural in this
particular case, but also that of its
possibility. If this had been admitted
for an instant, the measures of
the administration would have been
entirely different; they would have
had for their object the examination,
not the suppression, of the controversy.</p>

<p>One thing had been absolutely certain,
namely, the cures; whether they
had been brought about by the mineral
qualities of the water, by the
imagination of the patients, or by
miraculous intervention, these cures
were indubitable, and officially recognized
by the infidels themselves,
who, not being able to deny them,
merely tried to explain them on some
natural principle.</p>

<p>The faithful and perfectly trustworthy
witnesses to the efficacy of the
water in their own cases could be
counted by hundreds. There was
not a single one who reported that
its effects had been prejudicial. Why,
then, all these prohibitory measures,
these barriers put up, this menacing
armed force, these persecutions?
And why, if such measures were
proper, should not the principle be
carried out further? Why not close
every place of pilgrimage where a
sick person has been restored to
health, every church where any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
has received an answer to prayer?
This question was in every mouth.</p>

<p>"If Bernadette," said one, "without
saying anything about visions and
apparitions, had simply found a mineral
spring possessing powerful healing
virtues, what government would
ever have forbidden sick people to
drink of it? Nero himself would not
have gone so far; in all countries, a
reward would have been given to the
child. But here the sick people
kneel and pray, and these liveried
subalterns, who crouch before their
masters, do not like to have any one
prostrate himself before God. This
is the real reason. It is prayer which
is persecuted."</p>

<p>"But shall we allow superstition?"
said the free-thinkers.</p>

<p>"Is not the church able to take
care of that and to guard the faithful
against error? Let her act in her
own province, and do not make an
œcumenical council out of the prefecture,
and an infallible pope out of
a prefect or a minister. What disorder
has been caused by these
events? None whatever. What
evil has occurred to justify your precautionary
measures? Absolutely
none. The mysterious fountain has
only done good. Let the believing
people go and drink of it, if they
please. Leave them their liberty to
believe, to pray, to be healed; the
liberty to turn to God and to ask
from heaven consolation in their
grief. You who demand free thought,
let prayer also be free."</p>

<p>But neither the anti-christian philosophy
nor the pious prefect of
Hautes Pyrenees would consent to
notice this unanimous protest, and
the severe measures were continued.</p>

<p>The intolerance of which the enemies
of Christianity so unjustly accuse
the Catholic Church is their own
ruling passion. They are essentially
tyrants and persecutors.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE SHAMROCK GONE WEST.</h2>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF "ROMANCE OF THE CHARTER OAK."</p>


<p>About a generation ago, there
might have been seen moving across
the Wabash Valley, Indiana, one of
those heavy-built wagons, with broad
canvas tops, known in the West as
prairie schooners. The wheels, which
had not been greased since they left
New Hampshire, were creaking dolefully,
and the youth who urged on
the jaded team declared that the
sound reminded him of the frogs in
his father's mill-pond. Attached to
the rear of the wagon was a coop,
containing a rooster and half a dozen
hens, evidently suffering from their
long confinement; while underneath
the coop, swinging to and fro, as if
keeping time to the music of the
wheels, was a bucket.</p>

<p>Nat Putnam held the reins with a
tight grip, his eyes were fixed straight
in front of him, and his steeple crowned
hat, which looked as if it might
have been a legacy from one of his
Puritan forefathers, was placed as far
on the back of his head as possible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
so as not to obstruct the view. He
was perhaps twenty-one or two years
of age; but it would have been rash
to gauge his wisdom by the date of
his birth. If ever there was a Yankee
hard to outwit, it was our friend, and
his mother had often declared that
her boy could see through a stone
wall. The very shape of his nose,
which was not unlike an eagle's beak,
warned you to be on your guard
when you were making a trade with
him; while his face, spotted all over
with freckles, could readily assume
every expression from highest glee
to deepest melancholy; thus enabling
him to fill whatever post in life might
be most congenial, were it circus
clown or ruling elder.</p>

<p>"Mr. Putnam, when are we going
to halt?" inquired a female voice,
which seemed to come from the interior
of the wagon. Before the
youth answered, the speaker had
placed herself at his side and was
gazing at him with a woeful look.
Poor thing! well might she ask the
question. Ever since he had picked
her up in the State of New York, he
had kept travelling on and on, until
Mary O'Brien thought he was never
going to stop. Her father, who had
been with them the first week of the
journey, had died, and Nat had only
tarried long enough to bury the old
man, and let the daughter say a few
prayers over his grave.</p>

<p>"Don't find fault," he replied.
"The spirit moves me to keep pushing
West; the further I go, the better
I feel. This everlasting woods must
come to an end by-and-by, and when
we reach the open country you'll not
grumble."</p>

<p>"But I'm quite worn out," pursued
Mary; "and my shamrock is tired
too. If you'd only rest and make a
home, and let me plant it! The jolting
of the wagon and the want of sunlight
is killing it. Poor shamrock!" Here
she left the seat, but presently returned,
carrying a box filled with
earth, in which was a little three-leafed
clover.</p>

<p>"See," she exclaimed, "how different
it looks from a month ago. 'Tis
drooping fast." As she spoke she
gave the plant a kiss. Her companion
glanced at her a moment, then
with a smile of pity, "How old are
you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Eighteen."</p>

<p>"Humph! I guess you're out of
your reckoning. If you were that
old, you'd chuck that piece of grass
away and take to something serious.
There's my Bible, why don't you read
a chapter now and then? 'Twould
instruct you, and keep me from getting
rusty&mdash;a thing I'd deeply regret,
for I may take to exhorting if farming
don't pay."</p>

<p>"Throw my shamrock out of the
wagon! Why, Mr. Putnam, 'twas father's,
and he brought it all the way
from Tipperary. I'm going to keep
it&mdash;as long as I live, I am. It may
wither, but I'll never throw it away."</p>

<p>"Well, well, as you like. But I
repeat&mdash;why can't you read the Bible
once in a while, instead of wasting
your time playing with a lot of dried
peas? Do they come from Tipperary,
too?"</p>

<p>"Oh! these are my beads," she replied,
taking her Rosary from her
pocket; "and it's praying I am, when
you see me slipping these little round
things through my fingers."</p>

<p>"Praying! Then you must have
prayed a heap. Are you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Well, can't your spirit be moved
without using them peas, or beads
as you call them? It seems to me
they must bother you."</p>

<p>"I use 'em, sir, to keep count, or
I mightn't say all the Hail Marys and
Our Fathers." Here Nat started, and
lifting his sandy eyebrows, "Aha!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
he exclaimed. "So! Indeed! Then
'twas keeping a tally of your prayers?
Well, now, there's something in that.
I really didn't believe you were so
'cute. The devil couldn't say that
you hadn't been square on your devotions
when you'd kept a strict tally."</p>

<p>The girl smiled, then, bowing her
head, seemed to be whispering something
to the shamrock.</p>

<p>"Different from other gals!"
thought Putnam, as he glanced at
the pale face and long, raven hair,
which without braid or ribbon flowed
down until it rested on the bottom of
the wagon. "Yes, different from
other gals! Can't quite make her
out. She ain't a child, yet seems like
one. Keeping a tally of her prayers
is the first sign of her being 'cute.
But that's a beginning anyhow. I'll
educate her little by little. Oh! if
she'd only take to the Bible." Here
he gave the reins a jerk, then asked
Mary to read him a chapter from the
Book of Proverbs.</p>

<p>"I can't read," she frankly replied.</p>

<p>"Can't read! Can't read! That
I won't believe. Why, there's Jemima
Hopkins, in Conway, where I
come from, that not only reads, but
has started on a lecturing tour; and
she ain't&mdash;let me see; she was born
the year of the comet&mdash;no she ain't a day
over fourteen."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not Jemima Hopkins."</p>

<p>"No, that you ain't; Jemima is a
prodigy."</p>

<p>"And I'm a goose."</p>

<p>"But don't own it," said the youth.
"Talk as little as possible, and then
the world may not find it out. Why,
I know a chap in Conway that passes
for 'larned,' and all 'cause he has the
toothache every time he's asked to
make a speech. You see, he puts
on a wise look, holds his tongue, and
has so humbugged the folks that they
call him Uncle Solomon."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't want to be taken
for what I'm not," rejoined Mary, a
tear trickling down her cheek.</p>

<p>"What ails you now?" exclaimed
Nat. "Oh! how different you are from
Jemima Hopkins!" The girl made
no response, but sighed, "Father, father."</p>

<p>"The old man's underground,"
pursued the youth, in as soft a voice
as he could assume. "Crying won't
bring him back. Dry your eyes, and
vow to smash to atoms every whiskey-bottle
that ever comes within
your reach. I suspect his constitution
was undermined by habits of intemperance.</p>

<p>"Father didn't drink in Ireland,"
sobbed the girl. "'Twas at that horrid
grog-shop in New York he got the
habit."</p>

<p>"Pure fountain water," murmured
Nat, rolling his eyes toward the heavens,
"what a blessed thing thou art!
Those who give thee up for alcohol
make a poor swap." Then suddenly
fixing his gaze on the young woman,
"Mary," said he, "I never but
once tasted liquor. 'Twas at a cattle
show year afore last; and do you
know what happened? I paid two
hundred and fifty dollars for a horse
that was foundered and kicked so bad
I couldn't drive him home. Now
that's something I'd never have done
if my head had been clear; but 'twas
a lesson&mdash;a good lesson, and I told
Jemima Hopkins (who got wind of
it&mdash;women find out everything) to
make her first lecture on temperance."</p>

<p>The young woman, who seemed
not to have been listening to this episode
in his history, was now moaning
piteously for her father, nor did she
cease until her companion in an agitated
tone bade her keep quiet.
"Your lamentations," he said, "are
horrible to listen to."</p>

<p>"Don't you love your father?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
spoke Mary, gazing at him through
her tears. "Wouldn't you cry if he
were dead?"</p>

<p>"Cry if he were dead!" repeated
the youth with a shudder. "Oh!
why did you ask me that question?
You're a strange being. Who gave you
power to look into my heart? Do
you know that I quarrelled with the
old man, and left without saying good-by,
and every mile I've travelled his
last look has haunted me? 'I am
near the grave,' he said, 'don't abandon
me. Attend the mill, 'twill soon
belong to you.' But I laughed in
his face. 'The mill,' said I, 'is out
of repair, and only fit to shelter rats
and swallows; while the soil won't
yield more than fourteen bushels of
corn to the acre.' And then I turned
my back on him."</p>

<p>"When he's dead, you'll be sorry
for that," said the girl. "Write home
and ask his forgiveness. Do, before
it's too late."</p>

<p>"Home!" murmured the youth as
he drove along. "Home!" Oh! what
memories were awakened at the sound
of that word which spoke in a thousand
magic whispers! He was again
a little boy seated on his father's
knee, in the old house at the foot of
Mount Kearsarge, listening to stories
of the Revolution. The wind was
howling&mdash;the snow coming in through
the key-hole and under the door&mdash;a
fearful night to be out. But what
did he care about the tempest? He
was safe on his father's knee.</p>

<p>"Mary," said Putnam, just as they
reached the foot of a hill, "I'll take
your advice, and write home the first
chance I get. And I'll tell the old
man that I'm sorry for the hard
words I used. I'll ask him, too, to
follow me-for I'm going to halt by-and-by;
and I'll make him as comfortable
as if he were in New Hampshire."</p>

<p>"Do," said the young woman;
"'twill bring God's blessing on
you."</p>

<p>Here he placed the reins in her
hands, then, telling her that he was
going to reconnoitre and find which
was the best way to get over the hill,
he left the wagon with a lighter heart
than he had known in many a day.</p>

<p>A little climbing brought him to a
spot where the ground was again
level, but where the timber was thicker
and the wagon would have hard
work to get along; and he was wondering
if the everlasting forest was
never coming to an end, when he
was startled by a rustling noise, and,
looking round, saw a wild turkey dart
off her nest, while at the same
instant ever so many young ones,
which appeared as if only just hatched,
began scattering in every direction.
"I'll catch this fellow," said
Nat, running after the nearest bird,
"and make him a present to Mary."
But, young as it was, the little
thing managed to reach a clump of
hazel-bushes about thirty yards distant,
into which, its pursuer dashed
only a step behind, and in his excitement
Nat kept straight on, nor did
he stop until he found himself clear
of the thicket. But there he came
to a sudden halt, and for almost a
minute stood as if rooted to the
earth. Was the scene which had
burst upon him a vision of paradise?
The forest had ended, the hill sloped
gently to the west, and before him
like a boundless sea, fired by the rays
of the setting sun, lay the prairie of
Illinois. Then he shouted for Mary,
who with impatient step hastened up
the hill, wondering what was the
matter, and who arrived just as he
was beginning to sing <cite>Old Hundred</cite>.
The glorious view brought tears of
joy to her eyes, for she felt sure Nat
had at length found a spot where he
would be willing to settle down and
make a home, and, clasping her hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
she likewise offered up a prayer of
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>"Isn't this ahead of anything you
ever dreamed of?" exclaimed the
youth, when he had finished the
hymn. "I've heerd Parson Job
at camp-meeting trying to picture
heaven; but, although I'd not have
dared say it aloud, yet really I never
felt as if I'd care a straw about such
a place as he described&mdash;fellows with
wings and harps skipping around, and
singing hallelujahs for all eternity
without ever getting out of breath.
But here is a country I can imagine
like the home of the blest."</p>

<p>"Heaven is more beautiful than
this," rejoined his companion. "Yet
'tis a glorious country. Oh! settle
here, do, and give my shamrock
rest."</p>

<p>"As you say," continued Nat, patting
her cheek, and at the same time
piercing her through with his sharp
gray eyes. "You're my 'Blessing.'
I owe you more than I ever can pay.
When you made me promise to write
home and ask the old man's forgiveness,
a load heavier than a millstone
was taken off my heart. You ain't
as larned as Jemima Hopkins, and
you ain't 'cute&mdash;though keeping a tally
of your prayers is something, and
shows what you may become by proper
education&mdash;but, ignorant as you
are, there's still a great deal in you."
Here he left her, and went back for
the wagon, which, after not a little
difficulty, he managed to bring across
the hill; then, having chosen a spot
near a spring of water, he unhitched
the horses, while Mary let out the
fowls, who clapped their wings as if
they were mad; nor did the rooster
stop crowing until the hens&mdash;anxious
to make their nests&mdash;gathered round
him, and forced him to hold his tongue
and be serious.</p>

<p>As it was sunset, Putnam could do
little more than reconnoitre the vicinity
of the camping-ground, so, shouldering
his rifle, he walked off, leaving
the girl to prepare the evening meal.</p>

<p>But Mary had scarcely lit the fire
when he came running back, and
pointed out to her a figure on horseback,
advancing along the prairie.
"It may be an Indian," said he. "If
he's peaceful, I'll read him a chapter
in the Bible; if he's ugly, I'll
shoot."</p>

<p>In about a quarter of an hour the
stranger had approached near enough
for them to discover that he was a
person of their own race, with long,
white hair, and a cross hanging at
his side; so, throwing down the gun,
Nat shouted welcome. The traveller,
although astonished to hear a
human voice, did not draw rein, but
kept on up the hill, and in another
moment the youth had grasped his
hand and was giving it a hearty
shake.</p>

<p>"So soon!" exclaimed the Jesuit
missionary&mdash;for such was the character
of the new-comer. "Already! Oh!
you Americans are a great people.
In a few years you will be across the
continent."</p>

<p>"Well, I've fetched up here," said
Putnam, grinning. "Not that the
spirit didn't move me to push further
West; but yonder gal&mdash;my 'Blessing,'
as I call her&mdash;urged me to
stop."</p>

<p>Here the priest glanced at Mary,
then remarked:</p>

<p>"Your sister, I suppose, or
wife?"</p>

<p>"I haven't any sister," replied the
youth, "and ain't 'spliced' yet. She's
a gal I picked up as I was coming
through York State. Her father was
with her, and I took him along too;
but he died in a few days, and I buried
him on the roadside, and as she
had no home I told her she'd better
stick to me. She's awful green, but
for all that she has her good points,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and has made me happier than I've
been in a long time."</p>

<p>With this Nat beckoned to Mary,
who, as soon as she discovered in
whose presence she was standing,
fell on her knees, while the missionary
gave her his blessing.</p>

<p>That evening the youth, true to
his promise, wrote an affectionate letter
to his father, which the Jesuit assured
him he would deliver with his
own hand. "And I will bring you
an answer," said the latter, "for I
shall pass this way on my return to
the mission, which I hope to reach
before winter sets in."</p>

<p>The next morning, when Putnam
awoke, he found that the priest had
already departed.</p>

<p>"That," said the youth, "is a point
in his favor. The early bird catches
the worms. So, Mary, he was one of
your preachers? First I ever saw."</p>

<p>"I hope you liked him," rejoined
the girl.</p>

<p>"Well, his coming so handy to
take my letter did bend me toward
him; yet I don't think I ever could
sit still under his preaching."</p>

<p>"And why not?"</p>

<p>"'Cause he's a papist. I've heerd
enough about 'em."</p>

<p>To this the young woman made
no response, but gazed sorrowfully
at her companion a moment, then
turned her eyes toward the West.
The scene was enchanting. The breeze,
which had risen with the dawn, was
coming joyously over the prairie,
brushing aside the mist, gathering up
the perfume of ten thousand flowers,
and touched Mary's lips like a breath
from the Garden of Eden. And as
it played with her raven hair, and
brought the roses to her cheeks, Nat
could not help thinking she was as
fair as any lass he had ever met in
New Hampshire.</p>

<p>"Yet she don't seem to know it,"
he said. "She's very green about
her beauty." A herd of deer were
feeding only a short distance away&mdash;in
every direction the grouse dotted
the plain&mdash;while circling round and
round, in bold relief against the azure
sky, was an eagle.</p>

<p>The whole of this day and the
next, Putnam kept hard at work felling
trees to build a log-house, while
the girl remained near the wagon,
plying her needle, watching her
shamrock, which already showed
signs of renewed life, and gathering
the eggs, which the hens insisted on
laying every hour, so as to make up
for lost time.</p>

<p>At length, when he had cut down
trees enough, he bade Mary follow
him out on the plain, having first
filled her apron with stakes&mdash;for what
purpose she could not imagine.</p>

<p>"What on earth are you doing?"
she exclaimed, after having walked
by his side almost an hour.</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" he said, halting
abruptly. "Are you so green as
all that?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word," replied the girl,
"your conduct is distressing; yes, it
frightens me to see you turning and
twisting in every direction, driving
these pieces of wood into the ground,
and counting on your fingers. Oh!
what'll become of me if you've gone
mad?"</p>

<p>"Mad! Ha! Jemima Hopkins
wouldn't have said that. Jemima&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was born the year of the comet,"
interrupted his companion, laughing,
"and I'm only a goose."</p>

<p>"Well, don't own it if you are; I'll
educate you. And now here goes the
first lesson." With this he lifted his
forefinger, then shutting one eye,
"You must know we won't be long in
such a beautiful spot without company.
My wagon-tracks will lead many to
Illinois who wouldn't have stirred
from the shadow of Mount Kearsarge
if I hadn't set the example. Me-thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
even now I hear 'em cracking
their whips and bidding good-by to
the old folks in Conway. They'll
come, too, from other parts of New
Hampshire; ay, by the score and
hundred they'll come. Now, such
being the case, why not have a town
laid out by the time they arrive?
And right here where we stand shall
be our mansion: 'cause, you perceive,
it's a corner-lot. While yonder, on
t'other corner&mdash;so as to be handy in
case of rain&mdash;I'll get 'em to build the
meeting-house; and oh! won't I be
proud when it's finished! And what
a fine rooster I'll put on the steeple!"</p>

<p>"No, put a cross," said the young
woman, "or I'll not go inside of it."</p>

<p>"What! a cross, emblem of popery,
on this virgin soil, where there's
never been one seen, unless 'twas
that which your preacher carried
yesterday? No, indeed! I've heerd
enough about popery."</p>

<p>"I'll pray God to enlighten you,"
said the girl, at the same time heaving
a sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, the more light I get, the
less I'll want a popish emblem on
top of the meeting-house." Here
Nat struck his forehead, then
gazing at Mary with an expression
of anger, "Have you come so far
with me," he said, "to quarrel at
last? Bah! you are a goose." With
this he turned on his heel and walked
off, muttering to himself and evidently
very much excited.</p>

<p>Poor Mary did not open her lips
again that day, but helped build the
log-house with the greatest good-will.
Nor did Putnam address her a single
word. In fact, it was not until a week
had gone by and the dwelling was
almost finished that he so far recovered
from his ill humor as to speak to
her in a friendly way.</p>

<p>"Mary," said he, looking proudly
up at the mud-plastered chimney,
"this is a good beginning. The first
house is always the hardest to erect;
and you've worked like a beaver.
Tell me, now, are you still of the same
mind about the cross? Will you
stay away from meeting unless I give
up my point?"</p>

<p>"I will," replied the girl firmly. "I
want a Catholic Church, or none at
all."</p>

<p>"Is my 'Blessing' in earnest?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and praying hard that God
may open your eyes to the truth."</p>

<p>"Open my eyes! Well, you're
the first mortal ever insinuated that
Nat Putnam wasn't wide-awake.
But enough; there's a split between
us nothing can mend. Alas!" Here
he walked off to the hill muttering,
"What a pity! what a pity! Ignorant
as she is, there's yet something
about her which goes to my heart.
I love Mary O'Brien. I might even
ask her to become my wife, if she
hadn't such foolish notions about religion.
But not content with making
the sign of the cross afore every
meal, she actually wants one put on
top of the meeting-house. What an
idea! A cross! A thing never seen
on this virgin soil till that old preacher
came along."</p>

<p>For more than an hour the youth
wandered about the hillside, lamenting
Mary's obstinacy and superstition,
until at length he heard her
blowing the horn for dinner.</p>

<p>"Let her blow," he said, "I'm in
no humor to eat anything. I'll just
lay down and take a nap." With
this he threw himself on the ground,
and was about settling his head on a
comfortable spot, which seemed as if
intended by nature for a pillow, when
he gave a start and rose to his feet.
"As I live," he cried, "this is a
grave! And if there isn't a cross
at one end of it!&mdash;and some thing
carved upon the wood&mdash;what can
it be?" Here he stooped, and, after
brushing away a little moss which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
partly covered the knife-cuts, spelt
out the words,</p>

<p class="center">"May his soul rest in peace!"</p>

<p>"Well, now, this does beat all," he
continued. "Who'd 'ave believed a
cross had got to this place ahead of
me? And there's something about
the epitaph which makes me feel
solemn. I wonder how long since
these words were cut. Perhaps for
years and years only the deer and
eagles have gazed upon them. Perhaps
since the day the corpse was
buried, no lips but mine have spoken
over this lonely grave, 'May his soul
rest in peace!'"</p>

<p>For a few minutes the youth lingered
by the mound, wrestling with
himself&mdash;for he was conscious that a
change was coming over him&mdash;then
wended his way back to the cabin,
resolved to be frank with Mary, and
confess that a cross had got here before
Nat Putnam.</p>

<p>He had arrived within a couple of
paces of the door, which was half-open,
when, hearing her speaking,
he stopped. "She is praying," he
said. "What a fine voice she has!
Better than Jemima's." Then, softly
advancing, he discovered her kneeling
on the floor, her hands clasped,
and her cheek wet with tears. In
an earnest tone she was asking God
to pardon her father his many sins of
intemperance; then with equal fervor,
she began to pray for the speedy return
of the missionary, bringing Putnam
a blessing and forgiveness from
his aged parent.</p>

<p>At these words the youth trembled
with emotion, and bursting into the
room, "Mary, Mary," he cried, "I
take back all I said. I laughed
when you made the sign of the cross,
and I called you ignorant. But
you're more larned than Nat Putnam.
Your prayer, a moment ago,
stirred me up as I never was stirred
at camp-meeting. It made me feel
as when through the dark clouds I
see blue sky peeping out. Praying
for the dead! O God! if your
preacher comes back and tells me
father is dead, I can do one act of
reparation&mdash;pray for his soul. And
but for you, I'd not have written
home; but for you, black remorse
would have gone on eating deeper
and deeper into my soul&mdash;and remorse
is hell."</p>

<p>"Mr. Putnam," said the young
woman, who, startled by his wild
look, had risen to her feet, "my
prayers have been heard."</p>

<p>"Yes, they have. I am a Catholic,
and vow that our first meeting-house
shall have a cross upon it. O
my 'Blessing!' never can I be grateful
enough to the Almighty for throwing
you in my path!"</p>

<p>"It seemed an accident," pursued
the girl, "yet it may indeed have been
God's work. If it has proved for the
good of your soul, it, perhaps, has
saved mine. I cannot tell you how
I was tempted when I lived in the
city of New York. Why, one night,
when I was out looking for father,
somebody whispered in my ear that
I might live in splendor if I chose.
The tenement-house where we lodged
seemed to hold as many people as
there are in the whole of Tipperary.
Father and I, with a score of others,
slept in a damp room underground.
Oh! when I think of those days, it is
like a horrid dream."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't them people follow
my tracks? There's land enough
here, dear knows. Yes, let 'em all
come; only they must leave whiskey
behind. I want this to be a temperance
settlement." Then, after a
pause, "But, Mary, I wonder if
amongst them I'd find another like
you, my 'Blessing'?" With this, he
rose, and was about to throw his arms
round her neck, when he checked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
himself; then, after fumbling a moment
in his pocket, went out to
where her shamrock was blooming,
and, close by it, he put in the ground
a pumpkin-seed. Happy were the
June days which followed. With
what a light heart did Mary watch
the youth at work!</p>

<p>"He's a strange being," she would
say; "different from any I ever met
in the Old Country. But, for all that,
he is good; and when Father De
Smet returns I'll have him baptized,
and then there'll be no firmer Catholic
than Nat Putnam."</p>

<p>And the young man&mdash;how shall
we describe his feelings as, hour after
hour, he follows the plough?</p>

<p>"I'm making a home," he would
say, "for my 'Blessing.' How she
leans upon me! If I were to die,
what would become of her? She
don't know enough to give lectures,
like Miss Hopkins. Oh! if I could
only mix her and Jemima together.
Yet she's pretty handy at the needle,
and since she's overhauled my things
I ain't lost a button. And yet my
suspenders, darn 'em, do give awful
jerks once in a while."</p>

<p>One morning, while he was thus
silently praising Mary's skill in the
art of sewing, he stopped, gave a
groan, then, letting go the handle of
the plough, "Wrong!" he exclaimed.
"There goes one! Rip! whew!"
and, as he spoke, he grabbed a
button out of the furrow. For more
than a minute the youth examined it
thoughtfully, turned it over and over,
put it to his eye; then, with a grin,
"No," he said, "Mary didn't sew
this on; the thread sticking to it ain't
the kind she uses. Ah! Jemima Hopkins!
Jemima Hopkins! 'tis some of
your work. Yes, I remember; 'twas
just afore you started off lecturing,
and when your head was full of big
words. O Jemima Hopkins!"</p>

<p>And so the summer passed away.
The corn came up magnificently,
and when it was in all its glory, with
the west wind shaking the tassels,
Putnam would call Mary out to admire
it. "It looks," he would say,
"like a regiment of militia on parade."
The pumpkin-seed which he had
planted was now well above ground,
and creeping slowly but steadily
round and round the shamrock.
Once the girl was tempted to pull
the vine up, but, on reflection, it occurred
to her that she had better not.
And she was right; for under its
broad leaves her little plant found
shelter from the scorching rays of the
sun; and when the thunder-storms
burst over the prairie, the shamrock
would have been crushed by the
great rain-drops, which fell thicker
and faster than ever she had known
them fall in Ireland, but for the same
kindly protector.</p>

<p>One evening, toward the middle
of September, Nat came home from
work at an earlier hour than usual.
He appeared troubled; there was
evidently something on his mind;
and, when the girl asked what was
the matter, he scratched his head,
devoured her a moment with his
sharp, gray eyes, then, turning on his
heel, walked off to a log near the
door. There he seated himself, and,
after musing awhile, beckoned her
to approach.</p>

<p>The young woman obeyed, not,
however, without some misgiving.
"Mr. Putnam," she thought, "has
got tired of living so long in one
place, and is anxious to move further
west. Alas!"</p>

<p>In another moment she was seated
near him and gazing anxiously in his
face. He returned her look only for
an instant, then coughed, and, rolling
up his eyes, "'Tis a solemn thing
to do," he murmured. "But I can't
help it, and wouldn't if I could. I've
felt it coming over me ever since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
day she persuaded me to write home
to father. Jemima Hopkins would
grab at me like a sunfish at a worm in
April if I gave her a chance; but this
girl is so innocent-like that really I
don't know how to begin. And then
her very dependence on me, the solitude
of this spot, makes her kind of
sacred, and I dread lest even words
of purest love might give her offence."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Putnam," said Mary,
interrupting his soliloquy, "you're not
going to move away? Don't make
my shamrock travel any further.
Speak! Oh! I feel so anxious."</p>

<p>At these words, Nat cleared his
throat, cracked his knuckles, then,
in a voice singularly agitated for
one of his temperament, "Mary,"
he began, "I am never going to
move from this spot. You are fond
of it, and that's enough." At this
unexpected announcement the girl
clapped her hands. "But," he went
on, "I am not contented; there is
yet something wanting to make me
perfectly happy."</p>

<p>"And, pray, what is it, sir? I
know I am very green, but tell me
if the fault be mine; tell me, and I
promise to do all I can to please
you."</p>

<p>"Well," he pursued, raising his
hand and pointing at the pumpkin-vine
which circled round the shamrock,
"do you see yonder plant almost
hiding, and at the same time
protecting, the smaller one?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well, now, Mary, suppose you be
the shamrock, and let me be the
vine?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he gazed earnestly
at her. A faint blush crimsoned the
girl's cheek. She seemed a little
startled; and when she replied, "Yes,
I will be your shamrock!" it was in
a voice low and scarce above a whisper.</p>

<p>"Well done!" cried Nat, tossing
his hat in the air. "Well done!
As soon as the priest comes, we'll
have the knot tied."</p>

<p>That very evening, the missionary
arrived, bringing Putnam news from
home, which, although sad indeed,
was yet not unmingled with consolation.
His father was dead, but the
last words he had spoken were
words of forgiveness to the youth
who had abandoned him in his old
age. The Jesuit remained at the log-house
almost a fortnight, instructing
the convert in the faith, and, before
he departed, the latter had the happiness
of serving a Mass offered for
the repose of his father's soul.</p>

<p>"This never would have happened
but for you, my 'Blessing,'" said Nat,
pressing Mary's hand. "Those who
will follow me to this enchanting spot
may laugh at my becoming a Catholic,
but 'twill be because they are ignorant.
Your religion has in it something
sublime; it reaches across the
grave, and, by our prayers, gives
us a hold upon those who have
gone before us. Father! father!"
Here his voice failed, and for a minute
or two he wept. At length, mastering
his grief, he turned to the priest
and signified that he was ready for
the marriage ceremony to begin. It
was short; but while it lasted, a song-sparrow
(the first the youth had heard
since he arrived in Illinois) alighted
upon the window-sill and piped a joyous
carol. Often had he heard the
bird at his home near the foot of Mount
Kearsarge, and now its sweet notes
fell on his ear like the voice of a spirit
come all the way from the Saco Valley
to wish him happiness on his
wedding-day.</p>

<p>That evening, he took his wife and
the priest to visit the mound on the
hillside, and around it they knelt and
offered a prayer for the unknown
whose dust lay beneath.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>As they sauntered back to the
cabin, Putnam expressed a lively
hope that all his friends in New
Hampshire would emigrate to the
West. "And when Jemima arrives,"
he said, closing one eye and looking
at his wife with the other, "you'll see
something worth seeing; for she's
awful smart, and when we get arguing
together it's diamond cut diamond.
But I'll convert her; oh! I
will."</p>

<p>"No doubt," rejoined Mrs. Putnam,
"the discussion will be animated
and interesting, for you have
a clear head and a ready tongue,
while Miss Hopkins was born the
year of the comet; but believe me,
husband dear, it is praying, not arguing,
brings into the fold those who
are out of it."</p>

<p>"That must be so," he continued,
"for you never argued with me, and
yet now I'm a Catholic. O happy
day when Nat Putnam met Mary
O'Brien! And while I will strive by
every honest means to improve my
worldly condition, I will remain true
to the faith. Illinois is a wilderness
now, but they're coming, Mary,
they're coming; and, before your
raven hair turns gray, a city will
stand on this prairie; and opposite
our corner-lot shall be a church with
a cross upon it&mdash;a Catholic church.
And 'twill be thanks to you, my
'Blessing;' yes, thanks to the shamrock
gone West."</p>

<h2>SAYINGS OF THE FATHERS OF THE DESERT.</h2>


<p>An aged monk said to a brother
who was tempted by evil spirits:
When the evil spirits begin to talk to
thee in thy heart, do not reply to
them; but arise, pray, and do
penance, saying: Son of God, have
mercy on me. But the brother said
to him: Behold, O father, I do
meditate, and there is no compunction
in my heart, because I do not
understand the meaning of my words.
And he replied: Yet do thou meditate;
for I have heard that Abbot
Pastor and other fathers have spoken
this proverb: The charmer knows
not the meaning of the words which
he says, but the serpent hears, and
knows the virtue of the charm, and
is humbled and subjected to the enchanter.
So also with us, even
though we be ignorant of the meaning
of what we say, yet the evil spirits,
hearing, tremble and depart.</p>


<p class="p2">Abbot Pastor said: The beginning
of evils is to distract the mind.</p>

<p class="p2">Abbot Elias said: I fear three
things. One, when my soul shall depart
from the body; the second,
when I shall come before God; the
third, when sentence shall be pronounced
upon me.</p>

<p class="p2">Archbishop Theophilus, of holy
memory, when he was about to die,
said: Blessed art thou, Abbot Arsenius,
because thou hast ever had this
hour before thy eyes.</p>

<h2>THE LEGEND OF SANTA RESTITUTA.</h2>


<p>Ischia is one of the gems of the
Bay of Naples, and fortunately one
of the least known and least visited
of the tourist-haunted island group.</p>

<p>The Monte Epomeo rises in its
midst, a mass of tufa rock, perforated
here and there by <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fumarole</i>, that
is, openings through which volcanic
exhalations are constantly sending
forth their thin blue threads of
hazy smoke to mingle with the blue
and hazy atmosphere that veils the
whole island in a fairy and gossamer
robe. Two or three villages are
built upon the low girdle of sand
that lies at the foot of the mountain;
on one side of the island are ledges
of rock where the vine grows, on the
other is a projection, or rather a separate
rock, on which is built a state-prison.
Only one road passes through
Ischia, and no wheels ever leave their
marks there, save when a royal visitor
brings a modern carriage with
him. The inhabitants walk barefoot,
and the strangers ride donkeys, or
are carried in open sedan-chairs, called
"portantine." The women lounge
about at their cottage-doors, spindle
in hand, their heads curiously bound
up in silken handkerchiefs, and their
ears weighed down by huge ear-rings.
There is a wonderful and unspeakable
charm hanging over the place; the
beauties that elsewhere in Italy
hardly surprise you, seem to hold
you spell-bound here. The sea is
now blue, now green, now purple, always
of an intense color, and seemingly
an inverted firmament, where
the white fishing-smack sails stand
for clouds, and the little silver-crested
wavelets for stars. The air is very
pure, yet warm and balmy, and, when
the storm visits the island, even the
lightning must make itself more
softly beautiful than elsewhere, for it
is often seen in rose and violet colored
flashes, making the heavens like
to a vault of opal. The myrtle
grows on the mountain-side, and the
oleander blooms lower down, the
vines climb from the water's edge to
the roofs of the few rustic hotels the
island boasts, and among all these
beauties are hidden springs of medicinal
water and hot sea-sands, all of
them much used by Italians chiefly
in the shape of baths. The sand-bath
is a hole within four shanty-like
plank walls, and the patient has himself
buried in it up to his neck for
the time prescribed.</p>

<p>Of course, much is said to strangers
concerning the beauty of the
sunrise from the top of Epomeo.
But, as usual, when you go to see
the sun, you find him behind sulky
curtains of gray-white clouds that
roll like another sea between the blue
unseen Mediterranean and the bright
purple heaven above. Still, this, too,
is beautiful, though coldly so, and
very unlike the lovely western sunrise
over the Atlantic. But the glory
of Italy is in her sunsets, and toward
evening sea and mountain, tufa rock
and yellow sand, put on a marvellous
robe, a veritable "coat of divers colors,"
and life seems to breathe and
sigh in things that before seemed
lifeless.</p>

<p>Ischia, like all Italian localities,
has its patron saint; they call her
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa Restituta</i>.</p>

<p>When persecution was raging in
Egypt, in the third century, says the
simple legend, the body of a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
maiden, with a millstone tied round
her neck, floated across the sea and
rested in a creek on the south side of
the island. The creek is called after
the martyr to this day, and above it
are rocks whose black mass literally
overhangs and roofs in part of the
bay. Just where her body rested, in
a sandy, barren place, lilies grew up
and continued to bloom; they are
there now, and are very peculiar as
well as very lovely, a sort of cross
between the lily and the iris, with delicate
pointed petals, five in number,
and a tall smooth stem with very
little verdure. Not only do these
flowers grow nowhere else in the island
or out of it, but they will not
even grow in a land of their own
sandy soil if transplanted with a
quantity of it elsewhere. The millstone
that was round the saint's
neck is said to be embedded in a
wall in the neighborhood of her
church: there <em>is</em> such a stone, whether
the same or not no one can tell.
Later on, a church was erected over
the remains of the martyr, and she
was chosen patroness of the island.
A very curious Byzantine figure, gilt
all over and nearly life-size, was made
in wood and placed over the altar.
In one hand, she was pictured as holding
a book of the Gospels, and, in
the other, a full-rigged vessel. When
the south of Italy was invested by
Saracen hordes, Ischia did not escape
pillage, and of course, judging the
most precious things to be in the
church, as they always were in Catholic
times, the marauders rushed
to Santa Restituta's shrine, and attempted
to carry off the golden statue,
as they believed it to be. The
statue, naturally, was a movable
one, and used to be carried in procession
on certain stated occasions.
But now it remained rooted to the
spot, and no effort of the stalwart infidels
could move it a hair's-breadth
from its pedestal. In rage and disappointment,
one of them struck at
it savagely with his scimetar, and a
mark upon its knee still attests this
outrage. The sacrilege was promptly
punished, for the men themselves
now found they were unable to move,
and remained invisibly chained at
the foot of the miraculous image.
If they were released, the legend
does not say; let us hope that they
were freed by faith, and that conversion
followed this strange sign. The
statue remained immovable ever
since, and another image was made
to be carried in procession, with the
addition of the miraculously riveted
Saracens, in a small painted group
on the same stand as the figure itself.
Whether the legend be absolutely
true or only partly so, whether fact
and figure be mixed together, and
things spiritual typified under tangible
forms, it is not for us to decide,
but the simple faith of the happy
islanders is certainly to be admired,
and even to be envied. They have
yearly rejoicings, fireworks, processions,
songs, and services, and a military
parade of what national guards
they can muster, to celebrate their
saint's anniversary; they are proud
of her, and point out her statue and
tell her history to strangers with the
same enthusiasm with which soldiers
speak of a favorite general.</p>

<p>And, if my surmise be true, they
have had her celebrated in art by no
less a painter than Paul de la
Roche, whose "Martyre" is well
known all over Europe as one of the
chastest, truest, and most reverent
as well as most beautiful representations
of martyrdom. He has painted
a fair maiden in a white robe, and
her hands tied with a cruel rope in
front. The long, golden hair is
gently moved, like a strange and new
sea-weed, by the rippling water that
flows over it; the cord cuts into the flesh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of the white, delicate hand, and the
water seems reverently eager to pour
its coolness into the wounds and to
stay the cruel fever in them; the face
is that of an angel that is looking on
the Father's countenance in highest
heaven; a coronal of light rests, like
a sun-touched cloud, just above her
head, and in the dark background a
large mass of overhanging rock, just
like the rocks of Ischia, frown down
upon the sea-green bay, and shadows
of muffled, lurking figures are seen
watching the floating wonder from
above.</p>

<p>If the painter had not Santa
Restituta in his mind, the coincidence,
at least, is curious. Yet it is
true that so many blessed saints died
this death that he may have meant
to portray a typical rather than an individual
representation in this picture,
which is one of his masterpieces.</p>

<p>There is another floating figure,
with golden hair and folded hands,
which is more familiar to most people
than this one, and, though the
comparison is strange, I cannot help
introducing it here. I mean the figure
of Tennyson's <cite>Elaine</cite>, whom Gustave
Dore has made his own in his unapproachable
illustration of the <cite>Idyls
of the King</cite>, but whose history and
especially whose death has been the
source of many a painter's inspiration.
I hardly know one more touching
object in all modern poetry, save
that more solemn and more dignified
one that closes the idyl of <cite>Guinevere</cite>,
and whose calm sublimity almost
touches the divine. But though
the analogy of the "Lily Maid of
Astolat" borne down the river to the
oriel-windowed palace of Arthur's
Queen to that other lily maid, the virgin-martyr
of Egypt, be brought to
mind by the likeness in both cases
of the floating waters and the unbound
hair; yet here the analogy ends, for
we see that as far as heaven is from
earth, so far are these two beautiful
figures removed one from the other.
Both died for love, both died pure;
but the love of the one was such as,
once quenched in death, would never
live again, for she would be "even as
the angels;" while the love of the
other not only did death not quench,
but would make tenfold more ardent,
as she would "follow the Lamb
whithersoever he goeth," and sing
"the new canticle" no man could sing
but those "who were purchased from
the earth."</p>

<p>Tennyson's <cite>Elaine</cite> is a figure of
earth in earth's most sinless form
and most innocent meaning, yet still
earthly, still imperfect, still embodying
the idea of man's natural weakness
and inherent decay. Paul de la
Roche's "Martyre," or Ischia's Santa
Restituta, is a figure of heaven, an
already glorified soul, who, having
conquered the flesh, the world, and
the devil, having offered her body
to God "a living sacrifice," and having
"put on immortality," has passed
beyond our understanding and beyond
our criticism into that region
of bliss whose very dimmest ray would
be unbearable glare to our eyes, and
the full vision of which would bring
a blessed and a painless death in its
inevitable train.</p>

<p>It has been the fashion of our days
to think lightly of legends and traditions
of saints, to ridicule their so-called
<i>inventors</i>, and pity their supposed
<i>victims</i>. On the other hand,
we see families clinging to certain versions
of certain facts relative to their
long descent and the doughty deeds
of their world-famed forefathers; we
see nations dwelling complacently
on marvellous explanations concerning
their origin, and proudly pointing
to distant feats of knightly prowess
performed by northern Viking
and Frank or Vandal chief; we see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
tradition already growing up like
irrepressible vines around the memory
of great men buried perchance
but yesterday, and even around the
persons of living men to whom the
wheel of fortune or the rarer gift of
genius has given a temporary prominence;
and is it strange that Catholics
should love to repeat similar
legends concerning <em>their</em> forefathers,
the founders of <em>their</em> spiritual nation,
<em>their</em> forerunners in the kingdom of
heaven? We, too, have in our faith
a family pride, a national pride, and
a pride born of personal friendship and
attachment for some of God's living
saints, his yet uncrowned champions.
We are all one family, we all call to
God "Abba," that is, Father; we are
"the sons of God" and the "joint
heirs with Christ." We cannot help
rejoicing over the glory of one of
our brethren or sisters; we cannot
help being proud of their virtues and
seeking to perpetuate and honor their
memory. We are all one nation,
too, for there is but one Head, one
Lord, one Christ; and in the history
of the saints we learn the history of
the church, our state, our country,
our kingdom. And among <em>our</em> great
men, whom no wheel of fortune but
the divine decree of Providence has
lifted to pre-eminence among us, and
with whom, for the most part, holiness
and humility take the place of
genius&mdash;is it strange we should single
out some of whom, having known
them, we willingly speak and hear
little details told, and treasure them
up, and weave them into heart-poems
for our children's children?
So grows tradition, and a mind that
has no place in it for tradition's evergreen
vines to spread their beautiful
network is but a misshapen likeness
of the mind that God created in
Adam, and endowed with sympathetic
tenderness and appreciative
discrimination.</p>

<p>Some among us have had the
happiness to be brought into contact
with men greatly favored by God.
And who that had daily seen his humble,
hidden convent-life, that sweet
soul-poet and child-like priest, Frederick
Faber, could fail to accumulate
concerning him loving traditions,
and what our descendants may
hereafter call fond and vain legends?
And who that had once heard the
voice of Henry Newman, the leader
of the school of thought of our days
in the simple converse he loves best,
or in the plain instructions to his
school-children at catechism, could
help treasuring up such a recollection
as more precious by far than a
token of royal friendship, or the memory
of some unexampled intercourse
with state minister or powerful
diplomat? There are others who
have lived or are living in the same
cold, beliefless days as ourselves, and
whose presence, either tangible
through personal acquaintance or reflected
through their sermons or their
books, is a perpetual fragrance, which
we seek ever to keep alive in the garden
of our hearts by heaping up and
stowing away in our minds all manner
of details belonging to their
useful and everyday lives.</p>

<p>Pius IX. and Montalembert, and
the Curé d'Ars, and Father Ignatius
Spencer, and the Père de Ravignan;
Lacordaire and the convert Jew,
Hermann, the musician and Carmelite
who has but lately passed away,
and will be remembered, let us trust,
even as the Fra Angelico of the nineteenth
century; Mother Seton and
the Sœur Rosalie; Thomas Grant, the
saintly Bishop of Southwark, who
meekly laid down his burden in the
City of the Catacombs when his Lord
called him from the Council of the
Vatican to the foot of the throne;
and Henry Manning, and John
Hughes, and others yet whose names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
are known only to a few friends on
earth, but widely known among the
hosts of heaven, sons of Benedict and
daughters of Scholastica, all these
are among the chosen ones whose
names cannot but be speedily wreathed
in legendary and traditional history.
And even if it happens that some
detail lovingly told comes to be exaggerated,
and have accessories linked
to it by earnest&mdash;if indiscreet&mdash;zeal,
shall that be accounted as a
crime and a malicious distortion of
truth? An error of love can be
surely forgiven by mothers who are
proud of their battle-stained sons;
by children who worship the mother
that taught them, and the father who
guided and corrected them; by soldiers
who tell round the camp-fire
of the iron men who led them to
victory, or who bore with them and
for them an equally glorious captivity
and defeat; by sick men who
do not forget the "Sister's" care; by
all, in a word, who have a heart
wherewith to be grateful, a mind
wherewith to admire, a memory
wherewith to give honor.</p>

<p>What is true of the saints of to-day
is so, and was so from the beginning,
of the saints of long ages
ago. And if their history has come
down to us woven of fact and legend
both, it is thus only the more
historical to us, for it tells us the history
of the church's love for her glorified
children, as well as the record
of the real life of those children
themselves. Santa Restituta has thus
led us far from Ischia's scarcely
known beauties and simple island
shrine, but she now leads us back to
her own sanctuary by the thought
here suggested, that, even as many
hidden saints walk among us now,
so there are many hidden nooks of
the earth, like her sea-girt home,
where faith is still the daily bread of
the people, and where an almost
primeval innocence reigns under the
protection of that happy, childlike
ignorance which, according to modern
civilization, is the root of all
evil.</p>

<p>Hidden saints are like to these
little inclosed gardens of faith; their
hearts are valleys sequestered from the
glare of the world's unbelief and the
world's selfishness; their souls are as
rock-bound creeks where lilies grow
and wavelets ripple over golden
sands; with them, too, the sunset of
life is ever the most glorious hour, as
it is with Ischia's myrtle-clad rocks
and vine-crowned cottages.</p>

<p>Santa Restituta, pray for us, and,
if we are not worthy to be of the
number of the saints ourselves, suffer
us to be the historians, the biographers,
the poets of such saints as those
who are known only by name in one
remote corner of God's universe, or
of such other saints of whom glimpses
are now and then revealed to us
by the very simplicity and utter unguardedness
of their sweet and undefiled
nature.</p>

and resolve on useful measures connected
with Catholic education.]</p></blockquote>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. World</span>:</p>

<p>You have a talent for evoking
thought. The excellent paper on
higher education, which you published
in your issue for March, has set
me a-thinking; and as I hold you to
be a wise counsellor, I hope you
will allow me to communicate my
poor thoughts to you. I want to
talk to you about some of the difficulties
of Catholic education in the
United States.</p>

<p>By the way, the subject of your
article was working at the same time
in several minds. I read in the <cite>Galaxy</cite>
for March a long dissertation,
full of idolatry for Germany, on higher
education; and the students of St.
John's College, Fordham, New York,
celebrated Washington's birthday by
a series of splendid speeches on the
same theme. Would you, Mr. <span class="smcap">World</span>,
feel complimented if I should exclaim,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les beaux esprits se rencontrent</span>"?</p>

<p>Well, then, in the matter of college
education&mdash;for that is what I
have been thinking on&mdash;as in a multitude
of other matters, Catholics in
this country owe eternal gratitude
to their clergy. If we have any colleges
at all, to whom do we owe
them? To the zeal and self-sacrifice
of our Christian Brothers, of
our priests and our bishops. I think
that all our colleges were established
by churchmen, whether secular or
regular. It were, perhaps, invidious
to mention names&mdash;but we ought not
to withhold a deserved and willing
tribute of praise from the heroic men
who gave us our colleges. We say
heroic, for these men were truly such.
Lengthy reflection is not necessary in
order to justify the epithet. What a
mountain of obstacles had to be
cleared away to purchase the site of
these colleges, to build them, to man
them, to govern and carry them on!
Education is a noble and fertile subject
to speak about. It is an immense
blessing to be really educated. But
what an amount of toil and anxiety
does not this delicious fruit cost those
who seek to bestow it on our children!
How many harassing days
and nights have not the faithful superior,
professors, and prefects of a
college to spend in the exercise of
their several functions! All the
world knows that boys are not a very
inviting material to work on. They
are unreasoning, ungrateful, thoughtless,
inconstant; often weak, lazy,
perverse, and incorrigible. Many of
them act in college as though they
went there to torment everybody&mdash;or,
at most, for the benefit of the officers,
and not at all for their own good.
Of course, if boys were merely to be
taught lessons, much of the trouble
connected with their education could
be avoided. But Catholic colleges
mast make moral men and Christians&mdash;and
that, as we all know, is a difficult
task, for the young heart is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
wayward. Then, too, what heartburns
with fathers and mothers and
guardians! How little pecuniary compensation
for the educator! Yet
our clergy, be it said to their undying
honor, have nobly braved, outfaced,
all these privations and humiliations.
They are doing so even at
this day. Let them refuse to sacrifice
their time, talents, health, and
temporal weal, and we ask whether
there is in the United States a single
Catholic college which would not
have to suspend operation to-morrow?
We must remember that our
colleges are not endowed. In a financial
point of view, they depend almost
entirely on the fees of their students.
Commonly, too, they have more or
less of standing debts, for which yearly
interest must be paid. Were the
presidents, professors, and prefects of
such houses to exact fat salaries in
return for their sublime abnegation,
what, Catholic Americans, would be
the fate of all your colleges? Do
you often think of this when, amid
the ease and luxury of your drawing-rooms
and dinner-tables, you run
down this college, sneer at that other,
and wonder why a third does not
do this, that, and the other thing in
the shape of improvement? You
have colleges because your clergy
are willing to sacrifice their time
and tastes, to submit to drudgery, to
wear out their very lives, and live
and die in poverty. All praise to
you, Catholic priests and bishops, to
you religious orders of these United
States.</p>

<p>These remarks go to prove that
our first difficulty in the walks of
higher education is the slender means
of our colleges.</p>

<p>In the next place, it appears to your
unworthy correspondent that very
little is done to put an end to this
precarious and from-hand-to-mouth
existence. What generosity does the
laity show to our colleges? People
contribute munificently to convents,
asylums, churches, etc.; but how many
make donations to colleges; how
many found prizes, medals, or scholarships
in them? Very few, at least
so far as my knowledge goes. Colleges,
like poor bears in winter, are
supposed to live on their own fat.
No one asks them whether they
are in debt, in need of money,
would not accept of a collection of
books, minerals, philosophical apparatus,
or anything of that kind. No
one says: Wouldn't you allow me to
build you a good gymnasium, an exhibition
hall, give you an organ for
your chapel, or transfer to you some
of my shares in this or that lucrative
business? No, dear colleges, be comforted.
Live on as best you can. The
result is that these institutions can
never fully shake off their debt, they
can make but little material improvement,
or, if they attempt improvements,
it must be at a snail's pace.
Even graduates will forget the wants
of Alma Mater, and despise her for
her blameless penury, just as some
gross-natured upstarts scorn their
poor parents and friends. What a
different spectacle we should soon
witness in our colleges were gentlemen
of means to show their zeal for
education, and follow the wholesome
example of Protestants by bestowing
upon our seats of learning a portion
of their wealth! Progress would then
be possible, college bills could be
lightened entirely or at least partially,
gratuitous education might be
granted to deserving young men.
As things now stand, charity is out
of the question for most of our colleges.
We must endeavor to beget
and promote in our people this enlightened
and patriotic spirit toward
our colleges.</p>

<p>Difficulty number three: Many
persons take a narrow view of education.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Some act upon what may
be called the system of the three
R's, that is readin', 'ritin', and 'rithmetic.
They fancy their sons educated
when they can read, write, and
cast up accounts. Others may raise
their eyes a little higher, but in the
end, like the old Romans laughed
at by Horace, they value education
only in so far forth as it is a money-making
machine. Few are broad-minded
enough to see in education
a development of the entire man,
and, as a necessary inference, a slow
and gradual process. In consequence
of the errors afloat on this head, parents
will not allow time sufficient
for the education of their children.
They force colleges to crowd an immense
circle of studies into a short
space. The consequences are not
flattering. The mind cannot be thoroughly
developed, and education degenerates
into ill-digested instruction.
Depth is lost. Your paper, which
led me to think upon all these topics,
speaks very sensibly about philosophy.
But how, I ask, can anything
like a deep, serious, thorough
course of philosophy be taught in
one year? Still, that is all our young
men get, and that is all the generality
of parents will concede. Look at
our colleges&mdash;how many graduates
of the first year return to study a
second? Were it not better to give
no degree until the close of the second
year? The diploma once obtained,
though it is only a cowardly
sheep-skin, fills our young graduates
with valor, and makes them fancy
that they are fit to play roaring lion
all the country over. Every college
should devote at least two years of
its course to the study of philosophy.
Education without a sound philosophy
must always be a mere broken
shaft, a truncate cone, an abortion.
We ought to organize a crusade for
the welfare of philosophy in our colleges.
I was right glad, Mr. <span class="smcap">World</span>,
to hear you advocating the study of
this crowning branch of education,
and insisting, I think, upon sound
scholasticism. Scholastic philosophy,
that is the philosophy.</p>

<p>My next difficulty shall be proposed
in the form of a question: Could
not our Catholic colleges come to
an understanding, so as to have in all
of them about the same programme
and the same text-books? At present,
there is a very great divergence
on these points. For instance, what
a multitude of grammars we have, and
what wretched things for boys some
of these grammars are! They lack
method and logic, they dive too deep
into philosophy, and are too learned
and philosophical. Banish philosophy
and philology to their proper
spheres. When grammars of the
dead languages were much more
modest and unpretending, Latin and
Greek were better known, better written,
if not also better spoken. What
I say of grammars applies with equal
force to many other books now used
in our colleges. A convention of
our college authorities for the discussion
of these topics might do as
much good as many other conventions,
if not far more.</p>

<p>Parents and guardians have a great
share in the troubles experienced by
colleges. Nowadays, boys decide
almost everything with respect to
their education. It is they who make
choice of their college, determine
whether they shall study, how long
and what they shall study. All that
parents seem to have to say or do in
the matter is to obey their whimsical
offspring. I can understand that
there is no use in forcing a lad to
study what he reasonably cannot
learn; but I cannot see why the
management of his education should
be given over to him in fee-simple.
This violation of the fourth commandment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
throws honest colleges
into a dilemma. On the one hand,
they would like to keep their students,
and, on the other, they feel bound
to make those students work. But
the young lord of his destinies often
does not wish to study, and, if he is
urged to do so, he grows dissatisfied,
says the officers are too cross, and
leaves the institution. Should he
not be urged, he will idle away his
time, annoy everybody, learn nothing,
and finally, by his ignorance and bad
conduct, injure the reputation of his
college. Parents, when they send
their sons to college, should not forget
that these sons are not immaculately
perfect. They need a strong
dose of discipline. They must be
taught by word and deed that they
have to study and to obey. The
word of college authorities should
weigh more in the balance than that
of weak, lazy, and roystering young
lads. If these ideas prevailed somewhat
more than they do, and were
acted up to, colleges would have an
easier task to perform, their task
would be better performed, and the
education given to boys would be
more vigorous. There is too much
womanish fondness, too much indulgence,
shown to boys in these days.
We live in an age of feeling, of likes
and dislikes. Energetic, self-controlling,
strong manhood is on the
wane. Magnificent men could be
made out of our American boys. I
love them dearly. Their character
is full of fine traits. They are clever,
generous, open, and manly.
Why should they be emasculated
by false kindness and compliance?</p>

<p>Once in college, let us subject
these boys to solid and stiff examinations.
Those who fail, if they are
in the graduating class, should not
graduate that year, no matter what
great man or great woman may intercede,
scold, or shed tears in their
behalf. No <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prædeterminatio physica</i>
should settle on the gentlemen of the
graduating class. Because they happen
to be in that class, their graduation
must not become a fated necessity.
No doubt, it is a very nice sight
at the close of the year, on the annual
commencement day, to behold
a large number of young gentlemen
receiving their diplomas. The heart
of Alma Mater throbs with gladness
at the beautiful spectacle. But it is
a much nicer thing for Alma Mater
to have to say that her diploma is
deserved, and that she tells no lie to
the public when she asserts that her
graduate is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonæ spei et rite probatus</i>.
Then the diploma is a testimony
to worth: it is an honor to possess
it. If undergraduates miss their examination,
put them down mercilessly
into the class below that in
which they fail. By this process you
will lose a few boys, but you need
not regret them. For, first, they were
either idlers or stupid fellows. In
the next place, you can raise the
standard of your classes, you will
make your pupils work seriously, get
a good name for your college, and
end by having more students. Sensible
people will always send their
children to institutions that insist
upon hard study and rid themselves
of idlers.</p>

<p>Another difficulty which I must
notice regards the action, or rather
inaction, of the state. It is a pity
that our government, with all its fuss
about education, does so little real
honor to higher education. What is
the necessity or emolument of a diploma
from a college? I think
that, without a diploma, I can occupy
any position in the gift of the
country, save perhaps that of officer
in the regular army or navy. In
one way, the state is too much of a
busybody; in another, it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
fulfil its office in regard to education.
But I do not wish to open the question,
to-day, on the office of the
state in education.</p>

<p>One of the gravest obstacles in the
way of higher education arises, I think,
from our colleges themselves. It is
this: our colleges are too numerous.
With the exception of some boys from
Spanish America, we receive no pupils
from other countries. At home,
the number of Catholics who can afford
a college education for their children
is limited. Supposing, then, all
our colleges patronized, it is impossible
that any of them should reach a
respectable figure in the number of
its attending pupils. Besides, it must
be no easy task to find competent
professors and directors for so many
colleges. If we had fewer colleges,
each one would have a larger number
of pupils, and be more fully provided
with all that is necessary for education.
Yet there appears to be a
stronger desire to open new colleges
than to perfect those actually in existence.
Why do we thus weaken
and scatter our forces? Why do we
render success and large, grand centres
of learning next to impossible?
Grammar-schools, or schools in which
boys are prepared for college, should
be multiplied, but not colleges. Then
our colleges would resemble a university
more than they do to-day.
It is a great plague for them to be
obliged to do at once the work of
the grammar-school and of the college
properly so-called. They are
burdened with a crowd of children,
who are no companions for young
men, and lessen the dignity of a
college. And now, Mr. <span class="smcap">World</span>, let
me end these remarks by asking:
When shall we see each diocese in
the Union possessing a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit séminaire</i>?
When shall we see arise in our
midst a noble Catholic university?</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Rome and Geneva.</span> Translated from the
French. With an introduction by M.
J. Spalding, D.D., Archbishop of Baltimore.
8vo. Pamphlet. Baltimore:
John Murphy &amp; Co.</p></blockquote>

<p>We always knew that the Archbishop
of Baltimore is an able writer
of the more solid kind of essays,
but were not before aware how
gracefully he can use his pen in description.
In his preface to the pamphlet
whose title is given above, he
draws a very pretty and graphic picture
of Geneva, the ancient headquarters
of Calvin, and in right,
though not in possession, the See
of St. Francis of Sales. Some interesting,
curious, and gratifying facts
in connection with that city are
mentioned by the archbishop. He
tells us that half the population of
the city and canton is Catholic, and
of the other half only one-tenth is
Calvinistic. John Calvin's house is
a convent of Sisters of Charity.
The gloomy heretiarch and his companions
are unhonored and almost
unknown in the city which was once
called the Rome of Protestantism,
but which is now a sort of temporary
centre of Catholic activity in
Europe, while the Holy City is desecrated
by the rule of the Lombard
usurper. The pamphlet itself is a
letter addressed by a young law-student
of Geneva to our old friend
the eminent romance-writer, Merle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
d'Aubigné and one of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">confrêres</i>,
both of whom, it appears, seized
the occasion of the absence of the
bishop at the Council to make a feeble
assault on the church. It is a
manly, sensible letter, more interesting
as a specimen of what a young
student can achieve in a polemical
combat with veteran antagonists
than from anything new or peculiar
in its arguments. The youthful
champion uses his sling and pebble
with skill and dexterity, although
he had not so hard a skull as that
of Goliath of Gath to crack. Our
young gentlemen who are training
for professional life ought to be interested
to see how he does it, and
the noble, chivalrous spirit of faith
and honor which is manifest in the
letter is one we desire to see extended
as much as possible among
these generous youth who are able
to do as much for the cause of truth.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Sympathy of Religions.</span> An address
delivered at Horticultural Hall,
Boston, February 6, 1870. By Thomas
Wentworth Higginson.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Our true religious life begins
when we discover that there is an
inner light, not infallible, but invaluable,
which lighteth every man
that cometh into the world. Then
we have something to steer by, and
it is chiefly this, and not any anchor,
that we need." These are the two
opening sentences of the above lecture.
If an "inner light, not infallible"
is all that our author has "to
steer by," we beg, for our part, not to
enter on board the ship of which he
is the captain. In this case, it is not
the "inner light, not infallible" that
is invaluable, but the anchor, unless
one would foolishly expose himself
to certain shipwreck.</p>

<p>If this be man's plight, then let
him keep silence until he finds
something that will give him certitude.
For what else can an erring
guide lead to than error? It is the
blind leading the blind into the
ditch.</p>

<p>Think, too, of the absurdity of the
author's pretensions, with such a
guide, to criticise all religions in order
to give to the world "<em>the</em> religion"!&mdash;"the
religion of all ages!"</p>

<p>These free-religionists who talk
so much about the value of reason
have yet to learn its true value and
the great dignity of the human soul.
If the author's premise be true, it is
an insult to our common sense to
read his lecture.</p>

<p>We might perhaps appropriately
designate this work as "The
Popular Theology of Heaven:" <i>theology</i>,
because it is strictly accurate
in its dogmatic teaching; <i>popular</i>,
because the whole subject, without
being lowered, is brought within
the sphere of the popular mind. We
might call it also the "Spiritual
Geography of Heaven," since it
gives us such a knowledge as we
can have at this distance of the
promised land which we must hope
one day to inhabit. We are told
what is that beatific or happy-making
vision of God which is the essential
bliss of the elect; what is the
light of glory by means of which
the soul sees God; what are the occupations
of heaven, the social joys
of the blessed; the qualities and enjoyments
of the glorified body and
senses; the degrees of beatitude, yet
the complete and satiating happiness
of each individual, without envy
or jealousy, without regret of the
past or fear for the future. The book
presents an elegant appearance, and
is brought out in Messrs. Murphy &amp;
Co.'s best style.</p>

John Murphy &amp; Co. 1870.</p></blockquote>

<p>To the many excellent volumes
which Father Perrone has contributed
during his long career to the
theological library, he has now
made in the work before us an addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
in no way inferior to his previous
writings. It is a work addressed
to the learned alone, and in the
language of the learned; but it is
one which they will prize very highly,
not only for its depth of theological
lore, but also for its peculiar
fitness to the present time. Its subject
is the fundamental dogma of
Christianity&mdash;now so much attacked
and, we may add, outside of the Catholic
Church so little believed&mdash;the
Divinity of Jesus Christ, which it
proves and defends against the infidels,
the rationalists, and the mythics
of our day.</p>

<p>In the first volume, we have the
proofs drawn from the pages of the
Old Testament; in the second, those
furnished by the New Testament.
The third volume establishes the
Divinity of Christ on evidence drawn
from the institution of the church,
and, in particular, from the institution
of the Roman Pontificate. The
author demonstrates how the promises
made by the Redeemer to his
church, the characteristic marks by
which he distinguished her, the
gifts with which he enriched her,
give evidence of a Divine Author
and Founder. A most convincing
argument springs from the Primacy
conferred on St. Peter and his successors
in the See of Rome, since
God alone could have established
and maintained throughout the ages
and the nations of the earth so exalted
a dignity, together with the
prerogatives which befit its possessor.</p>

<p>Of all the works produced in our
day on this important subject, Fr.
Perrone's is without doubt the most
satisfactory, because the most forcible,
learned, and exhaustive.</p>

Oates &amp; Co. For sale by the Catholic
Publication Society, 9 Warren Street,
New York.</p></blockquote>

<p>F. Lallemant was one of the brightest
lights of the Society of Jesus, and
occupies in French spiritual literature
a place analogous to that of F.
Alvarez in the Spanish. This book,
of which a new edition has been
lately published, is now well known
in England and the United States
through the translation which was
brought out under the auspices of F.
Faber. It ranks among the best of
modern times, and even deserves to
be classed with the works of the
celebrated authors of past ages.
The pietistic mystics among the
Protestants, and even some Catholics,
prepossessed by certain unfounded
prejudices, have accused
the Jesuits as the enemies of interior
spiritual piety. There was
never a more unfounded charge.
The present work is one signal
proof, among many others, that
strict orthodoxy in doctrine, unswerving
fidelity to the teaching of
the Roman Church, and accurate
theological science, so far from
having quenched spirituality in the
Society of Jesus, have only given it
purity and illumination. The writings
of the thoroughly orthodox
masters of the spiritual life are, beyond
all comparison, superior, in
respect to their insight into the
mysteries of faith and their knowledge
of the higher paths of the
ascent toward union with God, to
any of those who have fancied themselves
illuminated with a private and
personal light of the Holy Spirit,
which they have thought should
supersede the infallible teaching of
the church. F. Lallemant is specially
remarkable for his skill and accuracy
in pointing out the perfect
harmony which must always exist
between the genuine interior guidance
of the Holy Spirit in the soul
and the exterior, divinely-appointed,
infallible guidance of authority to
which it must always be subordinate.
The <cite>Spiritual Doctrine</cite> is orthodox
and precise in its teaching without
being dull or dry; fervent and
spiritual without any tinge of vague
or visionary enthusiasm; clear, judicious,
and practical in its treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
of every topic; void of all wordy
declamation and vapid sentimentalism;
addressing the will and the
heart through the intellect; clothing
the thoughts and feeling of a
saint in the style and language of a
scholar. It is just the book for the
more intellectual and educated class
of readers, provided they have some
desire for solid Christian virtue and
piety.</p>

<p>To weave into a story interesting
incidents of colonial life in the
state of Connecticut, during the
reign of James II. of England, is the
intention of these two volumes. The
delineation of that remarkable incident
in Connecticut history, the
seizing of the state charter from
under the very eyes of the British
authorities, and its secretion for
many years in the famous Charter
Oak, and the picture of the regicide
Goffe living in perpetual fear
of detection are well drawn.</p>

<p>The story in some respects shows
a pen not yet perfectly at home in
this kind of writing; but no one
who takes an interest in our early

<p>The reproduction, in America, of
this work, originally written in Ireland,
will prove to be a benefaction
in many a homestead. This is the
work of a man who thoroughly
knows his subject. It is a book
for the time, free alike from the
doubtful stories of too many writings
of the same kind and the tedious
dryness that meets the youthful
eye in most books of instruction.
We wish a hearty God-speed to this
valuable accession to our English
Catholic literature. No Catholic
family in the land should be without
a copy of this book. It will be worth
more than its weight in gold to those
who read it; and to those who practise
the lessons of wisdom it contains
it will be their glory on earth and
their crown in heaven.</p>

<p>It is a book that ought to be encouraged
on missions and by all

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Countess of Glosswood.</span> A Tale.
Translated from the French. 1 vol.
16mo. Baltimore: Kelly, Piet &amp; Co.
1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have here a touching but
'ower sad' tale of the life of a Scotch
Covenanter who, being found in
arms against his king Charles II., is
condemned to death, but has his
sentence changed by the interposition
of a friend to a life of hard labor
in the Cornish mines. His wife,
the Countess of Glosswood, will not
leave her husband, but with her infant
daughter follows his hard fortune,
all communication with the
world outside of mining life being
forbidden by his sentence. But the
good God, in compensation for their
desolate lives, sends them the priceless
gift of faith, through the instrumentality
of a Catholic priest, disguised
as a miner that he may win
souls for Christ, in times when to
be known as a priest was to give
one's self up to certain death. The
countess had been taught to regard
the Catholic Church with hatred
and terror, and the agony of mind
through which she must pass in
learning to love what she had before
hated is forcibly described; and
the gentle way in which she is led
step by step toward the light by
the devoted priest cannot fail to
give satisfaction to the earnest reader.
The doctrine of indulgences
was, of course, a terrible stumbling-block
in her way, and Father Deymand's
explanation is specially clear
and convincing. The book comes
to us in an attractive dress, with
tinted paper and good type.</p>

<h2>SARDINIA AND THE HOLY FATHER.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></h2>



<p>The volume giving the call and
proceedings of the meeting held last
January at the Academy of Music,
in this city, in celebration of Italian
unity, especially the occupation of
Rome and the suppression of the
Papal government, is handsomely
printed, and does credit to the taste
and skill of our New York book-makers;
but it is a sad book, and
almost makes one despair of civil
society and natural morality. Nothing
can be more sad and discouraging
to all right-minded men
than to see a large number of the
most distinguished and influential
men of a great nation-statesmen,
politicians, judges, lawyers, officers
of the army, ministers of religion,
journalists, poets, philosophers, scholars,
professors and presidents of colleges
and universities&mdash;assisting, by
their presence, addresses, letters, or
comments, to applaud events notoriously
brought about by fraud, craft,
lying, calumny, and armed force, in
contravention of every principle of
international law and of public and
private right. It is a sad thing for
our republic when so many of its representative
men, whose names are
recorded in this volume, can endorse
the fraud and violence by which the
Sard king has effected what he calls
the unity of Italy, and congratulate
him on his successful sacrilege and
spoliation in the Roman state; and
the only consolation left us is that,
with a solitary exception, no Catholic
name appears on the list, and all the
sympathizers are Protestants, and all,
or nearly all, prominent adherents of
the same dominant political party.</p>

<p>To the unity of Italy, under some
circumstances, we might not seriously
object. It is true, we hold small
states are more favorable to the
growth of intelligence, the development
of elevated and strong personal
character, to individual liberty, to
social well-being, to the moral progress
of the people, than huge centralized
states or empires, which can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>be governed only despotically, and in
which there is so great a distance between
power and the people that
personal and affectionate relations
between the governors and the
governed, and which do so much
to soften the asperities of authority
and to render obedience willing and
cheerful, are, for the most part, impracticable.
But if the several independent
Italian states that have been
absorbed by Sardinia to form the new
kingdom of Italy had freely and of
their own accord given their consent
to the absorption, and no craft, fraud,
violence, or disregard of public or private
right had been resorted to in
order to effect it, we might doubt its
wisdom, but we could not object to it
on the ground of international law or
of natural justice. We, of course, defend
the temporal sovereignty of the
Pope; but if the Pope had, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">motu proprio</i>,
without coercion, the show or the
threat of coercion, given his consent
to the absorption of the Roman state
in a united Italy, we should have nothing
to say against it, for it would
have been the act of the Roman state,
no public or private right of justice or
morality would have been violated,
and no blow struck at the equal rights
of independent states or nations, at the
authority of the sovereign power of a
state to govern it, or to the duty of
obedience to it.</p>

<p>But it is well known that such is
not the case either with the Holy
Father or the several other Italian
sovereigns that have been dispossessed
and their states absorbed by
Sardinia in order to effect Italian
unity. In every case, the absorption
was effected by violence and
force, without and against the consent
of the sovereign authority. The
Pope refused his assent to the absorption
of the ecclesiastical state,
and said, to the demand to surrender
it, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non possumus</i>." The Roman
people, without the Pope, gave
no assent&mdash;had no assent to give or
to withhold; for, without the Pope,
they were not a state or a sovereign
people. It matters not whether plebiscitums
can or cannot be alleged,
for a plebiscitum, where there is a legitimate
government, cannot be taken
without its authority, especially not
against its authority; for without its
authority it would be a legal nullity,
and against it it would be revolutionary
and criminal. Nor would it
help the matter for the absorbing
state to invade with its armies the
state to be absorbed, overthrow the
legitimate government, take forcible
possession of the territory, and then
call upon the population to decide
their future condition by a plebiscitum,
so long as a legitimate claimant
to the government remains living.
This was the case in the Roman
state and in the other independent
Italian states that have been absorbed.
As a plebiscitum before the
conquest is treasonable and not permissible,
after the conquest it is a
mockery, for the fate of the state is
decided, however the population
may vote.</p>

<p>Let us look the facts in the face,
and see by what deeds and on what
principles the unity of Italy has been
effected. Sardinia, aided by France
and Prussia, made an unprovoked
war on Austria, and wrested from her
the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, and
appropriated it to herself. Neither
she nor her allies had any just cause
of war against Austria, or even of
offence, except that sire wanted to
get possession of all Italy. France
wanted the left branch of the Rhine
for her boundary, and Prussia wanted
to absorb the rest of Germany. There
was no other reason for the war. The
several independent Ducal states fell
with Austria, with whom they were
closely allied, and were invaded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
taken possession of by the Sard king.
The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was
invaded by Garibaldi and his filibusters,
backed&mdash;covertly at first,
openly at last&mdash;by the Sard government,
conquered, because the Neapolitan
king listened to the insidious
advice and deceitful promises
of Imperial France, said to have been
given not to offer any serious resistance,
taken possession of and appropriated
as the highwayman appropriates
the traveller's purse. The
Æmilian provinces of the Roman
state, prepared for insurrection by
the secret societies and Sardinian
emissaries, were invaded by the Sardinian
forces and appropriated by
the House of Savoy. Finally, the
Roman state was invaded by the
same Victor Emmanuel, with too
strong a force for the Papal government
to resist, its sovereign declared
deposed, its government suppressed,
and its territory and people annexed
to the so-called kingdom of Italy.</p>

<p>This simple recital of facts tells the
whole story. Sardinia, aided by the
arms and diplomacy of France and
Prussia, by the foreign policy of the
Whigs and Radicals of Great Britain,
the intrigues of the secret societies,
the money and co-operation of the
Protestant propaganda, the malcontents
and malefactors of all the states
of Italy, and adventurers and miscreants
from all nations of the earth, has
succeeded, without any right, without
having received any offence or provocation,
in the violation of every
principle of international law and
every precept of morality or natural
justice, in absorbing every Italian
state, and effecting the unification of
the whole peninsula under her own
royal house. These are the facts,
stated in their simplest form, without
passion and without exaggeration.</p>

<p>These facts, being public and notorious,
must be as well known to those
distinguished American sympathizers
who addressed the meeting or wrote
letters of approval to the committee
that called it as they are to us. We
dare not so insult the intelligence of
such eminent men as to suppose, for
a moment, that they did not know
what they sympathized with, or that,
in applauding the unity of Italy, they
were ignorant of the craft, violence,
and robbery that had been resorted
to in order to effect it. What, then,
must we and all right-minded men
think of their own principles, of their
religion, their politics, or their sense
of justice? Does their Protestantism
or their hatred of the Papacy justify,
approve the violation of international
law, the equal rights of sovereign
states, the sacred rights of property,
public and private, the principles of
natural justice the basis of the state
and of all legitimate authority, without
which not even natural society
itself can subsist? Does it authorize
them to applaud unprovoked war and
conquest, and public and private robbery?
If so, how can they justify
their Protestantism or their hatred of
the Papacy? If they cannot assert
either without denying all public and
private right and trampling on all
laws, human and divine, how can they
regard either as defensible?</p>

<p>There is no mistaking the real character
of the acts by which the sovereign
states of Italy have been suppressed
by Sardinia and her allies,
and the present unification of Italy
effected; and it only adds to their
atrocity that it was done in part by
exciting the populations, or a portion
of them, to insurrection and rebellion
against their respective sovereigns.
There is nothing meaner or more unjustifiable
than for one sovereign to
tamper with the fidelity of the subjects
of another, especially in time of
profound peace between the two
states. If persisted in, it is a justifiable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
cause of war. International
law, or the law of nations, makes all
sovereign states equal in their rights,
without regard to the form of government,
size, race, language, or geographical
position; and the law of
ethics, at least, requires each sovereign
state to respect, and to cause
its subjects to respect, the authority
of every other sovereign state over
its own subjects, as it requires every
other to respect its authority over its
subjects. The rule is, no doubt, often
violated, but it is none the less sacred
and binding on that account. It is
equally wrong for the citizens of one
state to attempt to seduce the citizens
of another state from their allegiance.
International law, national law, municipal
law, as well as the moral law,
know nothing of the doctrine, so eloquently
preached by the ex-Governor
of Hungary, of "the solidarity of
peoples."</p>

<p>Hon. Richard H. Dana, Jr., an
able lawyer, reputed to be well
versed in the law of nations, and
who affects, in his elaborate letter to
the committee, to argue the question
as it affects Catholics with fairness
and candor, appears to have some
doubts whether the invasion of the
Roman state by the Sardinian troops,
the deposition and virtual imprisonment
of its sovereign in his own
palace, and the annexation of its territory
and inhabitants to the dominion
of the House of Savoy, is really a
violation of international law; but
he evidently, besides arguing the
question on a collateral issue, takes
a juridical instead of an ethical view
of international law, and considers it
only so far as it enters into the national
jurisprudence, and is enforcible
by the nation through its own courts
on its own citizens. Yet he cannot
be ignorant that there are violations
of international law which cannot be
taken cognizance of by the national
jurisprudence, and which may be, and
often are, justifiable causes of war.
The basis of international law is the
law of justice, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">droit naturel</i>, as it
is the basis of all natural ethics.
There may be treaty or conventional
agreements between nations, which
must be considered whenever the
case comes up juridically, or the law
is to be juridically enforced, but these
cannot abrogate or modify the law of
justice, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus gentium</i> of the Roman
jurists, which is the principle and foundation
of all law. Acts in contravention
of justice, St. Augustine and St.
Thomas after him tell us, are violences
rather than laws, and are nullities.
International law applies justice
to the mutual relations of sovereign
states, precisely as ethics does to the
relations of individuals. It declares
all sovereign states equal in their
rights, the territory of each to be
sacred and inviolable, and that no one
is permitted to do to another what
it would not have another to do to
it. The rule is plain and practicable,
and under it Mr. Dana's doubts
ought to vanish. For one sovereign
state to invade with its armies another,
suppress its government, and
absorb its territory and population,
without any provocation or any offence
given, but merely because it
wants it to complete and round off its
own territory, as Sardinia has done
to the Roman or ecclesiastical state,
is too manifestly a violation of international
law to leave any doubt
on any mind that does not hold the
principle of all law to be that might
makes right.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>No doubt certain untenable theories
of popular sovereignty and certain
alleged plebiscitums have had
something to do with blinding the
eyes of our American sympathizers
to the atrocity of the acts they applaud.
But plebiscitums cannot be
pleaded when taken without the order
or assent of the sovereign authority,
if there is a sovereign authority,
as we have already said. In
the case of every Italian state absorbed,
there was a sovereign authority,
and the plebiscitum taken was
not by its order or assent, but against
its positive prohibition. It is idle
to say that the people of these several
states gave their consent to be absorbed,
for except as the state, represented
by its sovereign authority,
there is no people with a consent
either to give or to withhold. The
people, no doubt, are sovereign in
the constitution and government, but
not otherwise, for otherwise they
have no existence. A people or population
of a given territory wholly
disorganized, without constitution or
laws, and deprived of all government,
must necessarily, for simple preservation,
reorganize and reconstitute government
by conventions or plebiscitums
as best they can; but when
they have reconstituted government
or the state, their sovereignty merges
in it. The people of the United
States and of the several states can
amend the constitution, but only
constitutionally, through the government.
The notion which has latterly
gained some vogue, that there persists
always a sovereign people back
of the government and constitution,
or organic people, competent to alter,
change, modify, or overturn the
existing government at will, is purely
revolutionary, fatal to all stable government,
to all political authority, to
the peace and order of society, and
to all security for liberty, either public
or private. We see the effects of
it in the present deplorable condition
of France.</p>

<p>The resolutions reported by the
committee and adopted by the meeting,
and which Dr. Thompson in his
address tells us "are constructed on a
philosophical order of thought," attempt
to place "the temporal power
of the Pope within the category of
all earthly human governments, and
bound by the same conditions and
subject to the same fortunes." This
may be successfully disputed. The
Roman or ecclesiastical state was a
donation to the Holy See or the
Church of Rome. Gifts to the church
are gifts to God, and when made are
the property, under him, of the spirituality,
which by no laws, heathen,
Jewish, or Christian, can be deprived
of their possession or use
without sacrilege. They are sacred
to religious uses, and can no longer,
without the consent of the spirituality,
be diverted to temporal uses,
without adding sacrilege to robbery.
Whoso attacks the spirituality attacks
God. The property or sovereignty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of the Roman state vests, then, in the
Holy See&mdash;hence it is always called
and officially recognized as the state
of the church&mdash;and not in the Pope
personally; but in him only <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex officio</i>
as its incumbent, as trustee, or administrator.
Hence the Pope denied
his right to surrender it, and answered
the Minister of Sardinia, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non
possumus</i>. The temporal power of
the Pope is therefore not within the
category of all earthly human governments,
but is the property of the spirituality.
Victor Emmanuel, in despoiling
the Pope, has despoiled the Holy
See, the spirituality, usurped church
property, property given to God, and
sacred to the religious uses. The
deed which our eminent jurists and
Protestant divines sympathize with
and applaud, strikes a blow at the
spirituality, at the sacredness of all
church property, of Protestant churches
as well as of Catholic churches&mdash;at
the sacredness of all eleemosynary
gifts, and asserts the right of power
when strong enough to divert them
from the purposes of the donors.
These Protestant ministers assert in
principle that their own churches
may be despoiled of their revenues
and funds without sacrilege, without
injustice, by any power that is able
to do it. They defend the right of
any one who chooses to divert from
the purpose of the donors all donations
and investments to found
and support hospitals, orphan asylums,
retreats for the aged and destitute,
asylums for idiots, deaf-mutes,
the blind, the insane, public libraries,
schools, colleges, seminaries, and
academies, peace societies, tract societies,
home and foreign missionary
societies, and Bible societies; they
not only defend the right of the state
in which they are placed to confiscate
at its pleasure all funds, revenues,
and investments of the sort, but
the right of any foreign state to invade
the territory in time of peace,
take possession of them by armed
force, as public property, and to divert
them to any purpose it sees proper.
Did the learned divines, the eminent
jurists, who approve the resolutions
ever hear of the speech of Daniel
Webster and the decision of the Supreme
Court of the United States in
the famous Dartmouth College case?
Or are they so intent on crushing
the Papacy that they are quite willing
to cut their own throats?</p>

<p>But the fact of the donation to
the Holy See is denied. Be it so.
Certain it is that the Roman state
never belonged to the Sard kingdom;
that the church has always
claimed it, had her claim allowed
by every state in the world, has possessed
the sovereignty, not always
without disturbance, for a thousand
years without an adverse claimant;
and that is sufficient to give her a
valid title by prescription against all
the world, even if she have no other,
which we do not admit&mdash;an older and
better title than that of any secular
sovereign in Europe to his estates.
Every sovereign or sovereign state
in Europe is estopped by previous
acknowledgment, and the absence
of any adverse claimant with the
shadow of a right, from pleading the
invalidity of the title of the Holy
See. The Roman state is therefore
ecclesiastical, not secular.</p>

<p>Whether Père Lacordaire ever said,
as Dr. Thompson asserts, that "in
no event could the people be donated,"
or not, we are not authentically
informed; but if he did, he said a
very foolish and a very untrue
thing. The people cannot be donated
as slaves, nor could any of their
rights of property or any of their
private or public rights be donated.
Every feudal lawyer knows that. The
donation, grant, or cession could be
and was only the right of government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and eminent domain, or the
right the grantor possessed; but that
could be ceded as Louisiana was
ceded by France, Florida by Spain,
and California by Mexico, to the
United States. In the cessions made
to the Holy See, no right of the people
to govern themselves or to choose
their own sovereign was ceded, for
the people ceded had had no such
right, and never had had it. The
sovereign who had the right of governing
them ceded his own right to
the church, but no right possessed or
ever possessed by the people or inhabitants
of the territory. International
law knows no people apart
from the sovereign or government.
The right of self-government is the
right of each nation or political people
to govern itself without the dictation
or interference of any foreign
power, and is only another term for
national independence. What was Pepin's
or Charlemagne's, either could
cede without ceding any right or
possession of the people. So of the
donations or cessions of that noble
woman, the protectress of St. Gregory
VII., the Countess Matilda. If
Père Lacordaire ever said what he
is reported to have said, he must
have forgotten the law to which he
was originally bred, and spoken rather
as a red republican than as a Catholic
theologian, statesman, or jurist.</p>

<p>But waiving the fact that the sovereignty
of the Roman state has a
spiritual character by being vested in
the Holy See, and granting, not conceding,
that it is in "the category of
all earthly sovereignties," its right is
no less perfect and inviolable, and
the invasion and spoliation of the
Roman state by Sardinia, as of the
other Italian states, are no less indefensible
and unjustifiable on any
principle of international law or of
Christian or even of heathen ethics;
for one independent state has no
right to invade, despoil, and appropriate
or absorb another that gives
it no just cause of war. Nor is the
act any more defensible, as we have
already shown, if done in response
to the invitation of a portion, even a
majority, of the inhabitants, if in opposition
to the will of the legitimate
authority. Such invitation would
partake of the nature of rebellion,
be treasonable, and no people has
the right to rebel against their sovereign,
or to commit treason. Men
who talk of "the sacred right of
insurrection," either know not what
they say, or are the enemies alike of
order and liberty. The people have,
we deny not, the right to withdraw
their allegiance from the tyrant who
tramples on the rights of God and
of man, but never till a competent
authority has decided that he is a
tyrant and has forfeited his right to
reign, which a Parisian or a Roman
mob certainly is not. How long is
it since these same gentlemen who
are congratulating Victor Emmanuel
were urging the government, leading
its armies, or fighting in the ranks, to
put down what they termed a rebellion
in their own country, and condemning
treason as a crime?</p>

<p>But the Romans and other Italians
are of the same race, and speak the
same language, we are told. That they
are of the same race is questionable;
but, suppose it, and that they speak
the same language. They are no more
of the same race and speak no more
the same language, than the people
of the United States and the people
of Great Britain; have we, on that
ground, the right to invade Great Britain,
dethrone Queen Victoria, suppress
the Imperial Parliament, to annex
politically the British Empire to
the United States, and to bring the
British people under Congress and
President Grant?</p>

<p>But as Italy is geographically one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
it ought, we are told again, to be politically
one. The United States, Canada,
and Mexico, including Central
America and British Columbia, are
geographically one; but will any of
the honorable or reverend gentlemen
who addressed the meeting, or wrote
letters to the committee that called
it, contend that we have, therefore,
the right unprovoked, and simply because
it would be convenient to have
them politically a part of our republic,
to invade them with our
armies, suppress their present governments,
and annex them to the
Union?</p>

<p>"Rome is the ancient capital of
Italy, and the Italian government
wishes to recover it, and needs its
prestige for the present kingdom of
Italy." But in no known period of
history has Rome ever belonged to
Italy; Italy for ages belonged to
Rome, and was governed from and
by it. Never in its whole history
was Rome the capital of an Italian
state, or the seat of an Italian government.
She was not the capital
of any state; she was herself the
state as long as the Roman Empire
lasted, and as such governed Italy
and the world. The empire was not
Roman because Rome was its capital
city, but because Rome was the
sovereign state itself, and all political
power or political rights emanated,
or were held to emanate, from her;
and hence the empire was Roman,
and the people were called Romans,
not Italians. If you talk of restoration,
let it be complete&mdash;recognize
Rome as the sovereign state, and the
rest of the world be held as subject
provinces. Italy was never the state
while Rome governed, nor has the
name Italy at all times had the same
geographical sense. Sometimes it
meant Sicily, sometimes the southern,
other times the northern, part of the
peninsula&mdash;sometimes the heel or the
foot, and sometimes the leg, of the
boot.</p>

<p>It might or it might not be desirable
for the pretended kingdom of
Italy to have Rome for its capital,
or the seat of its government, though
we think Florence in this mercantile
age would be far more suitable. But
suppose it. Yet these Protestant ministers
must know that there is a divine
command that forbids one to
covet what is one's neighbor's.
Achab, king of Israel, wanted Naboth's
vineyard, and was much troubled
in spirit that Naboth would not
consent to part with it either for love
or money. His queen, the liberal-minded
Jezebel, rebuked him for his
dejection, and, fearing to use his
power as king of Israel, took measures
in his name that Naboth should
be stoned to death, and the vineyard
delivered to Achab. It was all very
simple and easily done; but we read
that vengeance overtook the king,
fell heavily on him, his household,
and his false prophets; that Jezebel
fled from the Avenger, was overtaken
and slain, and "the dogs came and
licked up her blood." There is such
a reality as justice, though our American
sympathizers with the liberal
and enlightened Jezebel seem to
have forgotten it.</p>

<p>Dr. Stevens, the Protestant Episcopal
Bishop of Pennsylvania, rejoices
at the spoliation of the Pope, the absorption
of the Roman state, and the
unification of Italy, because "Italy is
thus opened to liberal ideas, and
Rome itself unlocked to the advancing
civilization and intelligence of
the nineteenth century." Which advancing
civilization and intelligence
are aptly illustrated, we presume, by
the recent Franco-Prussian war, the
communistic insurrection in Paris, the
prostration of France, the nation
that has advanced farthest in liberal
ideas and nineteenth-century civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
We have here on a fly-sheet
a specimen of the liberal ideas to
which Italy is opened, and of the
sort of civilization and intelligence
to which Rome is unlocked. We extract
it for the benefit of Bishop Stevens
and his brethren:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Religions said to be revealed," these
free-thinkers tells us, "have always been
the worst enemy of mankind, because by
making truth, which is the patrimony of
all, the privilege of the few, they resist
the progressive development of science
and liberty, which can alone solve the
gravest social problems that have tormented
entire generations for ages.</p>

<p>"Priests have invented supernatural
beings, made themselves mediators between
them and men, and go preaching
always a faith that substitutes authority
for reason, slavery for liberty, the brute
for the man.</p>

<p>"But the darkness is radiated, and progress
beats down the idols and breaks
the chains with which the priesthood has
bound the human conscience. Furiously
has raged the war between dogma and the
postulates of science, liberty and tyranny,
science and error.</p>

<p>"The voice of justice, so long silenced
in blood by kings and priests conspiring
together, comes forth omnipotent from the
secret cells of the Inquisition, from the
ashes of the funeral pile, from every stone
sanctified by the blood of the apostles of
truth. People believed the reign of evil
would last for ever, but the day is white,
a spark has kindled a conflagration.
Rome of the priests becomes Rome of the
people, the Holy City a human city. She
no longer lends herself to a hypocritical
faith, which, by substituting the form for
the substance, excites the hatred of people
against people solely because the one
worships a God in the synagogue and
the other in the pagoda.</p>

<p>"The association of free-thinkers is established
here most opportunely to give
the finishing stroke to the crumbling edifice
of the priesthood, founded in the ignorance
of the many by the astuteness of
the few. Truth proved by science is our
creed; respect for our own rights in respecting
the rights of others, our morality.</p>

<p>"It is necessary to look boldly in the
face the monster which for ages has
made the earth a battle-field, to defy him
openly and in the light of day. We
shall therefore be true to the programme
of civilization, in the name of which the
<i>world has applauded the liberation of Rome</i>
from the Pope, and we call upon all who
love the moral independence of the family,
prostituted and enslaved by the priest,
upon all who wish a country great and
respected, upon all who believe in human
perfectibility, to unite with us under the
banner of science and justice.</p>

<p>"To Rome is reserved a great glory&mdash;that
of initiating the third and most
splendid epoch of human civilization.</p>

<p>"Free Rome ought to repair the damage
done to the world by sacerdotal Rome.
She can do it, and she must do it. Let
the true friends of liberty be associated,
and descend to no compromise, no bargain
with the most terrible enemy the
human race has ever had."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>
<p>This programme of the Association
of Free-thinkers in Rome is not an
inapt commentary on the letter of
the Bishop of Pennsylvania, and is a
hearty response to the sympathy and
encouragement given them in their
work of destruction by the great and
respectable New York meeting. It
at least tells our American sympathizers
how their friends in Rome understand
their applause of the deposition
of the Pope from his temporal
sovereignty and the unity of Italy.
Are they pleased with the response
given them?</p>

<p>There may be a difference between
the free-thinkers and their American
friends; but the chief difference apparently
is, that the free-thinkers are
logical and have the courage of their
principles, know what they mean
and say it frankly, without reticence
or circumlocution, while their American
sympathizers have a hazy perception
of their own principles, do
not see very clearly whither they lead,
and are afraid to push them to their
last logical consequences. They
have not fully mastered the principles
on which they act; only half-know
their own meaning; and the
half they do know they would express
and not express. Yet they are great
men and learned men, but hampered
by their Protestantism, which
admits no clear or logical statement,
except so far as it coincides with the
free-thinkers in regarding the Papacy
as a monster, which must, in the interests
of civilization and liberty, be
got rid of. Yet we can discover no
substantial difference in principle between
them. The deeds and events
they applaud have no justification or
excuse, save in the atrocious principles
set forth by the free-thinkers.
We are willing to believe these distinguished
gentlemen try to persuade
themselves, as they would fain persuade
us, that it is possible to war
against the Papacy without warring
against revealed religion or Christian
morals, as did the reformers in the
sixteenth century; but these Roman
free-thinkers know better, and tell
them that they cannot do it. They
understand perfectly well that Christianity
as a revelation and an authoritative
religion and the Papacy
stand or fall together; and it is
because they would get rid of all
religions that claim to be revealed
or to have authority in matters of
conscience, that they seek to overthrow
the Papacy. They attack the
temporal sovereignty of the Pope
only as a means of attacking more
effectually his spiritual sovereignty;
and they wish to get rid of his spiritual
sovereignty only because they
wish to rid themselves of the spiritual
order, of the law of God, nay, of
God himself, and feel themselves free
to live for this world alone, and
bend all their energies to the production,
amassing, and enjoying the
goods of time and sense. It is not the
Pope personally, or his temporal government
as such, that they call the
worst enemy of mankind, or the
"monster that for ages has made the
earth a field of blood," but revealed
religion, but faith, but the supernatural
order, but the law of God, the
spiritual order, which the Pope officially
represents, and always and
everywhere asserts, and which his
temporal power aids him to assert
more freely and independently. They
recognize no medium between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Papacy and no-religion. They disdain
all compromise, admit no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via
media</i>, neither the Anglican <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via media</i>
between "Romanism" and dissent,
nor the Protestant <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via media</i> between
the Papacy and infidelity.
They war not against Protestantism,
though they despise it as a miserable
compromise, neither one thing nor
another; they even regard it with
favor as a useful and an efficient ally
in their anti-religious war.</p>

<p>The free-thinkers in Rome and
elsewhere present the real and true
issue between the Papacy and its
enemies, and give the real meaning
of the atrocious deeds which
have effected the deposition of the
Pope, the absorption of the state of
the church, and the unity of Italy
under the House of Savoy. They
present it, too, without disguise, in
its utter nakedness, so that the most
stolid cannot mistake it; precisely as
we ourselves have uniformly presented
it. The issue is "the Papacy
or no-religion," and the meaning of
the deeds and events the New York
meeting applauded is, "Down with
the Papacy as the means of putting
down religion and emancipating the
human conscience from the law of
God!" How does the Protestant
Episcopal Bishop of Pennsylvania,
and his brother Protestant Episcopal
bishops among the sympathizers
with Italian unity, like the meaning
or the issue, when presented truly
and honestly, and they are forced to
look it squarely in the face? What
does Mr. Justice Strong, of the Supreme
Court of the United States,
think of it? He is the president of
an evangelical&mdash;perhaps we should
say fanatical&mdash;association, whose object
is to procure an amendment to
the preamble of the Constitution of
the United States, so that the republic
shall be made to profess, officially,
belief in God, in Christ, and the supernatural
inspiration of the Scriptures
of the Old and New Testaments.
What says he to the assertion that
"religions said to be revealed have
always been the worst enemy of mankind"?
Yet his name appears among
the sympathizers with Italian unity.
Do these gentlemen know what
crimes and atrocities they applaud,
and what is the cause with which
they express their sympathy? Or,
like the old Jews who crucified the
Lord of Life between two thieves,
are they ignorant of what they do?</p>

<p>These Roman free-thinkers only
give us the programme of the secret
societies, who have their network
spread over all Europe, and even
over this country; of the Mazzinis
and Garibaldis, of the Red Republicans
and Communists, who have
instituted a new Reign of Terror in
Paris, who are filling the prisons of
that city while we are writing (April
7) with the friends of order, with
priests and religious, plundering the
churches, entering and robbing convents
and nunneries, and insulting
and maltreating their peaceful and
holy inmates, banishing religion from
the schools, suppressing the public
worship of God, and drenching the
streets in the blood of the purest
and noblest of the land, all in the
name of the people, of liberty, equality,
and fraternity&mdash;the programme,
in fact, of the whole revolutionary,
radical, or so-called liberal party
throughout the world. The realization
of civil liberty, the advancement
of science, the promotion of society,
truth, and justice, are&mdash;unless, perhaps,
with here and there an individual&mdash;a
mere pretext to dupe simple
and confiding people, and gain
their support. The leaders and knowing
ones are not duped; they understand
what they want, and that is the
total abolition of all revealed religion,
of all belief in the spiritual order, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the universal, eternal, and immutable
principles of right and justice, and
the complete emancipation of the
human intellect from all faith in the
supernatural, and of conscience from
all the law not self-imposed.</p>

<p>Are our American sympathizers
with Victor Emmanuel in his war
on the Pope, with the unity of Italy,
and the revolutionary party throughout
Europe, and with which the Protestant
missionaries on the Continent
in Catholic nations are in intimate
alliance, really dupes, and do they
really fancy, if the Papacy were gone,
the movement they applaud could be
arrested before it had reached the
programme of the Association of
Free-thinkers in Rome? We can
hardly believe it. Europe was reorganized,
after the fall of the Roman
Empire, by the Papacy, and consequently
on a Christian basis&mdash;the independence
of the spiritual order,
and the freedom of religion from
secular control or intermeddling, the
rights of conscience, and the supremacy
of truth and justice in the mutual
relations of individuals and of
nations. No doubt the Christian
ideal was far from being practically
realized in the conduct of men or nations;
there were relics of heathen
barbarism to be subdued, old superstitions
to be rooted out, and fierce
passions to be quelled. The Philistines
still dwelt in the land. In reorganized
Europe there was no lack
of great crimes and great criminals,
followed often by grand penances
and grand expiations; society in
practice was far from perfect, and
the good work that the church was
carrying on was often interrupted, retarded,
or destroyed by barbarian
and heathen invasions of the Normans
from the North, the Huns from
the East, and the Saracens from the
South.</p>

<p>But the work was renewed as soon
as the violence ceased. Under the
inspiration and direction of the Papacy
and the zealous and persevering
labors of the bishops and their clergy,
and the monastic orders of either sex,
assisted not unfrequently by kings and
emperors, secular princes and nobles,
the Christian faith became the acknowledged
faith of all ranks and
classes, individuals and nations.
Gradually the old heathen superstitions
were rooted out, the barbarisms
were softened if not wholly subdued,
just and humane laws were
enacted, the rights of individuals and
of nations were defined and declared
sacred and inviolable, schools were
multiplied, colleges established, universities
founded, intelligence diffused,
and society was advancing,
if slowly yet surely, towards the
Christian ideal. If men or nations
violated the immutable principles of
justice and right, they at least recognized
them and their duty to conform
to them in their conduct; if the law
was disobeyed, it was not denied or
so altered as to sanction men's vices
or crimes; if marriage was sometimes
violated, its sacredness and indissolubility
were held to be the law, and
nobody sought to conform it to the
interests of lust or lawless passion; if
a feudal baron wrongfully invaded
the territory of his brother baron, or
oppressed his people, it was acknowledged
to be wrong; in a word, if
the conduct of men or nations was
bad, it was in violation of the principles
which they held to be right&mdash;of
the law which they owned themselves
bound to obey. The conscience was
not perverted, nor ethics and legislation
made to conform to a perverted
conscience.</p>

<p>But in the sixteenth century, bold,
base, and disorderly men rose not
only in acts of disobedience to the
Pope, which had been no rare thing,
but in principle and doctrine against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the Papacy; declared it a usurpation,
hostile to the independence of sovereigns
and the Bible; denounced the
Papal Church as the mystery of Babylon,
and the Pope as the man of sin.
The sovereigns listened to them, and
the people of several nations believed
and trusted them, cast off the Papacy,
and interrupted the progress in manners
and morals, in society and civilization,
which had been going on from
the sixth century to the sixteenth under
the auspices of the Popes. The
reformers, as they are called, no doubt
really believed that they could cast
off the Papacy and retain the church,
Christianity, revealed religion, in even
greater purity and efficiency. Yet
the experiment, it must be conceded,
has not succeeded. The church, as
an authoritative body, has been lost
with the loss of the Papacy. The
Bible, for the want of a competent
and authoritative interpreter, has
ceased to be authority for faith, and
has been made to sanction the most
various and contradictory opinions.
Faith itself has been resolved into a
variable opinion, and the law of God
explained so as to suit each man's
own taste and inclination. Religion
is no longer the recognition and assertion
of the supremacy of the spiritual
order, the rights of God, and the
homage due to our Maker, Redeemer,
and Saviour; nothing eternal
and immutable is acknowledged,
and truth and justice, it is even contended,
should vary from age to age,
from people to people, and from individual
to individual.</p>

<p>The state itself, which in several
anti-Papal nations has undertaken to
supply the place of the Papacy, has
everywhere failed, and must fail, because,
there being no spiritual authority
above it to declare for it the
law of God, or to place before it a
fixed, irreversible, and infallible ideal,
it has no support but in opinion, and
necessarily becomes dependent on
the people; and, however slowly or
reluctantly, it is obliged to conform to
their ever-varying opinions, passions,
prejudices, ignorance, and false conscience.
It may retard by acts of
gross tyranny or by the exercise of
despotic power the popular tendency
for a time, but in proportion as it
attempts it, it saps the foundations
of its own authority, and prepares its
own overthrow or subversion. If in
the modern non-Catholic world there
has been a marked progress in scientific
inventions as applied to the mechanical
and industrial arts, there has
been an equally marked deterioration
in men's principles and character.
If there is in our times less distance
between men's principles and
practice than in mediæval times, it is
not because their practice is more
Christian, more just or elevated, for
in fact it is far less so, but because
they have lowered their ideal, and
brought their principles down to the
level of their practice. Having no
authority for a fixed and determined
creed, they assert as a principle none
is necessary, nay, that any creed imposed
by authority, and which one
is not free to interpret according to
one's own private judgments, tastes,
or inclination, is hostile to the growth
of intelligence, the advance of science,
and the progress of civilization. The
tendency in all Protestant sects, stronger
in some, weaker in others, is to
make light of dogmatic faith, and to
resolve religion and morality into the
sentiments and affections of our emotional
nature. Whatever is authoritative
or imposes a restraint on our
sentiments, affections, passions, inclinations,
fancies, whims, or caprices,
is voted tyrannical and oppressive,
an outrage on man's natural freedom,
hostile to civilization, and not
to be tolerated by a free people, who,
knowing, dare maintain their rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Take as an apt illustration the
question of marriage, the basis of
the family, as the family is the basis
of society. In the Papal Church
marriage is a sacrament, holy and
absolutely indissoluble save by death,
and the severest struggles the Popes
engaged in with kings and emperors
were to compel them to maintain its
sanctity. The so-called reformers
rejected its sacramental character,
and made it a civil contract, and
dissoluble. At first, divorces were
restricted to a single cause, that of
adultery, and the guilty party was
forbidden to marry again; but at
the pressure of public opinion other
causes were added, till now, in several
states, divorce may be obtained
for almost any cause, or no cause at
all, and both parties be at liberty to
marry again if they choose. There
are, here and elsewhere, associations
of women that contend that Christian
marriage is a masculine institution
for enslaving women, though it
binds both man and woman in one
and the same bond, and that seek to
abolish the marriage bond altogether,
make marriage provisional for so long
a time as the mutual love of the parties
may last, and dissoluble at the
will or caprice of either party. No
religious or legal sanction is needed
in its formation or for its dissolution.
Men and women should be under
no restraint either before or after
marriage, but should be free to couple
and uncouple as inclination dictates,
and leave the children, if any
are suffered to be born, to the care
of&mdash;we say not whom or what. Say
we not, then, truly, that without the
Papacy we lose the church; without
the church, we lose revealed religion;
and without revealed religion, we
lose not only the supernatural order,
but the moral order, even natural
right and justice, and go inevitably
to the conclusions reached by the
free-thinkers in Rome. One of the
greatest logicians of modern times,
the late M. Proudhon, has said:
"One who admits the existence even
of God is logically bound to admit
the whole Catholic Church, its Pope,
its bishops and priests, its dogmas,
and its entire cultus; and we must
get rid of God before we can get
rid of despotism and assert liberty."</p>

<p>Let our American sympathizers
with Victor Emmanuel and the unity
of Italy look at modern society
as it is, and they can hardly fail to see
that everything is unsettled, unmoored,
and floating; that men's minds are
everywhere shaken, agitated by doubt
and uncertainty; that no principle, no
institution, is too venerable or too sacred
to be attacked, no truth is too
well established to be questioned, and
no government or authority too legitimate
or too beneficent to be conspired
against. Order there is none,
liberty there is none; it is sought, but
not yet obtained. Everywhere revolution,
disorder&mdash;disorder in the
state, disorder in society, disorder in
the family, disorder in the individual,
body and soul, thoughts and affections;
and just in proportion as the
Papacy is rejected or its influence
ceases to be felt, the world intellectually
and morally, individually and
socially, lapses into chaos.</p>

<p>We describe tendencies, and readily
admit that the whole non-Catholic
world has not as yet followed out
these tendencies to their last term;
in most Protestant sects there are undoubtedly
those who assert and honestly
defend revealed religion, and to
some extent Christian doctrines and
morals; but, from their Catholic reminiscences
and from the reflected influence
of the Papacy still in the
world by their side declaring the
truth, the right, the just, for individuals
and nations, and denouncing
whatever is opposed to them, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
from Protestant principles or by virtue
of their Protestant tendencies;
and just in proportion as the external
influence of the Papacy has declined
and men believed it becoming
old and decrepit, has the Protestant
world been more true to its innate
tendencies, developed more logically
its principles, cast off more entirely
all dogmatic faith, resolved religion
into a sentiment or emotion, and rushed
into rationalism, free religion,
and the total rejection of Christian
faith or Christian morals, and justified
its dereliction from God on principle
and at the command of what
it calls science&mdash;as if without God
there could be any science, or anybody
to cultivate it. The Protestant
world has no principle of its own
that opposes this result, or that when
logically carried out does not lead surely
and inevitably to it. The principles
held by Protestants that oppose it
and retain many of them from actually
reaching it are borrowed from
the Papacy, and if the Papacy should
fall they would fall with it.</p>

<p>Now we ask, and we ask in all
seriousness, the learned jurists, the
distinguished statesmen, the able editors,
the eminent Protestant divines,
poets, and philosophers, who took
part in or approved the great sympathy
meeting, where but in the Papacy
are we to look for the nucleus or
the principle of European reorganization,
for the spirit that will move
over the weltering chaos and bid light
spring from the darkness, and order
from the confusion? We know they
look anywhere but to the Papacy; to
the Parisian Commune, to Kaiser
William and Prince Bismarck, to Victor
Emmanuel, to Mazzini, and to
Garibaldi&mdash;that is, to the total abolition
of the Papacy and the Catholic
Church. But in this are they not
like the physician who prescribes, as
a cure to the man already drunk,
drinking more and more deeply?
Are they not like those infatuated
Jews&mdash;we are writing on Good Friday&mdash;who
demanded of Pilate the
release, not of Jesus in whom no fault
was found, but of Barabbas, who was
a robber! Can Barabbas help them?
Will he help re-establish the reign of
law, and teach men to respect the
rights of property, the rights of sovereigns,
and the duties of subjects?</p>

<p>We say not that the Pope can reorganize
Europe, for we know not
the secret designs of Providence.
Nations that have once been enlightened
and tasted the good word of
God, and have fallen away, lapsed
into infidelity, and made a mock of
Christ crucified, cannot easily, if at
all, be renewed unto repentance and
recover the faith they have knowingly
and wilfully cast from them. There
is not another Christ to be crucified
for them. We have no assurance
that these apostate European nations
are ever to be reorganized; to be saved
from the chaos into which they are
now weltering; but if they are, we
know this, that it can be only by the
power and grace of God, communicated
to them through the Papacy.
There is no other source of help.
Kings and Kaisers cannot do it, for it
is all they can do to keep their own
heads on their shoulders; the mob
cannot do it, for it can only make
"confusion worse confounded;" the
popularly constituted state, like our
own republic, cannot do it, for a popular
state, a state that rests on the
popular will, can only follow popular
opinions, and reflect the ignorance,
the passions, the fickleness, the selfishness,
and the basenesses of the
people; science and philosophy cannot
do it, for they are themselves disorganized,
in a chaotic state, uncertain
whether man differs from the
brute, whether he has a soul, or is
only a congeries of matter, and whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
he is or is not developed from the
monkey or the tadpole; atheism cannot
do it, for it has no positive principle,
is the negation of all principle,
and effective only for destruction;
Protestantism cannot do it, for it is
itself chaos, the original source of
the evil, and contains as its own no
principle or organite from which a
new organization can be developed.
We repeat, then, if there is any hope,
it is in the Papacy, which rests on a
basis outside of the world, and speaks
with divine authority; and the first
step to reorganization must be the
re-establishment of the Holy Father
in the full possession of his rights.
Whether there is faith enough left on
earth to demand and effect his restoration,
remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Certain it is, let men say what they
will, the Pope is the only sovereign
power on earth at this moment that
stands as the defender of the rights
of independent governments, of international
law, the equality of sovereign
states without regard to size,
race, language, or geographical position&mdash;the
sole champion of those
great, eternal, and immutable principles
of justice on which depend
alike public liberty and individual
freedom, the sanctity and inviolability
of the family, the peace and order
and the very existence of society.
If the kings and rulers of this world
are with him, or dare utter a feeble
whisper to encourage and sustain
him, the people are opposed, or cold
or indifferent, and pass him by, wagging
their heads, saying in a mocking
tone, "He trusted in heaven, and
let heaven save him."</p>

<p>It were little short of profanity to
indicate the contrast between his
sublime attitude and the abject
and servile attitude of these distinguished
countrymen of ours. They
but prove themselves slaves to the
spirit of the age, and only reflect
popular ignorance and passion, and
follow the multitude to worship at
the shrine of Success, and to trample
on the wronged and outraged. He
dares arraign the fierce and satanic
spirit of the age, to face the enraged
multitude, to defy popular opinion
or popular passion, to proclaim the
truth it condemns, to defend the
right it tramples under foot, and uphold
the scorned and rejected rights
of God, and the inviolability of conscience.
It were an insult to truth
and justice, to moral greatness and
nobility, to dwell on the contrast.
His attitude is that of his Master
when he trod the wine-press alone,
and of the people none were with
him. It is grand, it is sublime, beyond
the power of mortal man, unless
assisted with strength from above.
No man, it seems to us, can contemplate
his attitude, firm and inflexible,
calm and serene, without being
filled, if he have any nobility or generosity
of soul, or any sense of moral
heroism or true manliness in him,
with admiration and awe, or feeling
that his very attitude proves that
he is in the right, and that God is
with him. Let our American sympathizers
with his traducers and persecutors
behold him whom they calumniate,
and, if they are men, blush
and hang their heads. Shame and
confusion should cover their faces!</p>

<span class="i0">To sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>Is a pleasure accorded to few only
of the dwellers upon earth; seldom
indeed to the few who could best appreciate
the privilege. A large portion
of the sum total of human existence
is spent in cities. Outside of
these, the wants of life, best supplied
by the co-operation of numbers, gather
people together in towns and villages.
Travelling is generally such
only as may be needful in the exercise
of trades and professions, with a
view to their ultimate end, the accumulation
of wealth; or such as exhausted
energies demand to fit them
for further toil. The invalid, it is
true, seeks to revive his failing powers
in far-away balmy climates and
delicious scenes&mdash;and there is a love
for his birthplace in the heart of
many a wanderer which leads him
back time after time to the old homestead,
and invests it with countless
charms, although bleak and barren
its surroundings may be&mdash;but to how
few individuals it is given, in the fulness
of their health and mental faculties,
to rove abroad at will through
the beauties and sublimities of creation&mdash;to
look on her rolling oceans
and broad lakes; her foaming cataracts
and stupendous mountains;
on the luxuriant loveliness of the
torrid zone, and the icy wonders of
the north!</p>

<p>Yet such things always make part
of the expectancies, the bright anticipations
of youth&mdash;the day-dreams,
crushed down at last by hard realities.
For to generation after generation
the story of life is strangely
the same. Its general events unfold
themselves in a succession marked
for each one with singular uniformity;
a uniformity, indeed, so susceptible
of calculation that on it are based
many of its most extended speculations.</p>

<p>Pecuniary interests generally push
their claims first and most boldly,
because least to be evaded. Then
come the petty edicts of an artificial
social existence, which command and
receive submission before their presence
is even suspected, and though
their power be neither recognized nor
acknowledged. Gradually the turning
kaleidoscope of time shows more
sombre colors; the path to be trodden
is made visible&mdash;the mind bends
itself to the narrow way&mdash;earthly
happiness seeks its realization in a
circumscribed sphere&mdash;and so, one
by one, the winged thoughts lower
their circle of flight, and the dreamer
ceases to dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>But the love of nature is implanted
too deeply in the heart of man
to be ever entirely eradicated; and
the sentiment finds for itself an expression
coextensive with its existence
in the universal love of flowers.
They have a charm for the eye
and soul welling from a deeper source
than those graceful forms and brilliant
colors, for they are a portion
of the great universe. They are a
link, and an important one, and the
one most exquisitely fashioned, in
the mighty chain which holds beside
them not only the everlasting hills,
but</p>

<p class="center">
"Planets, suns, and adamantine spheres."<br />
</p>

<p>Year after year they return to us
with a beauty which never palls, to
make us wiser, and better, and happier;
and as punctually they meet
from each true heart a greeting fitly
due to their fairy manifestations of
the same boundless Power which
called forth those mightier, sublimer
forms of matter so often placed beyond
our reach.</p>

<p>Flowers, when mention is made
of them in the Old Testament, are
consecrated (so to say) by the most
lofty associations; they typify virtue&mdash;happiness&mdash;the
Deity himself.
When the inspired writer would fain
depict in language level to our humble
capacity pleasures of which we
can have not the most distant idea&mdash;the
pleasures of man's first terrestrial
paradise&mdash;he calls it a garden; as
the word best embodying to us happiness
sinless and complete; and the
Deity in the same sacred volume
prompted</p>

<p class="center">
"The flower of the field, and the lily of the valley,"
(Cant. ii.)<br />
</p>

<p>as the most appropriate figures of
his own divine holiness. Flowers
with lamps of fine gold made part
of the decorations of Solomon's temple.
The Scriptures were originally
written in the land of bold imagery
and under a burning sun, where herbage
and water constitute wealth;
consequently, we find throughout its
pages rich pastures and flowing
streams suggested themselves as emblems
of rewards not only in this
world, but of those beyond the grave.
Again, the brief span of life, and the
uncertainty of all earthly possessions,
are imaged by the fading flower and
the withered grass; and the prophets
in their denunciations of the wicked
constantly compare them, in the desolation
of utter abandonment, to a
garden without water.</p>

<p>Asia has always been the especial
land of flowers; from the rose-gardens
which Semiramis<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> planted at
the foot of Mount Bajistanos, 800
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, to the fragrant gardens now to
be seen in almost every oriental city.
The fame of these rose-gardens extended
so far that Alexander the
Great, on his Eastern expedition, turned
a long way from his course to visit
them. The city which Solomon
founded, Tadmor in the wilderness
(Palmyra), about midway between
the Orontes and Euphrates, was celebrated,
and indeed derived its name,
from the abundance of a magnificent
species of palm-tree which grew there.
This tree (the <i>Borassus</i> of Lin.) yields
a liquor seducing and pernicious, and
in taste resembling weak champagne.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
The ruins of this city and its surroundings
are described by travellers
as exceedingly imposing. The
city of Susa (in Scripture, Susan), in a
district lying on the Persian Gulf,
was in ancient days the residence of
the Persian kings; their summers being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>spent at Ecbatana, in the cool
mountainous district of Media. The
name Susa signifies a lily, and is
said to have been given on account
of the great quantity and beauty of
these flowers which grew in its vicinity.
The fertility of the land of
Bashan is mentioned in Scripture,
and its oaks are coupled with the cedars
of Lebanon. Media also is
mentioned by old writers; and Carmania,
north of the Persian Gulf,
boasted of vines bearing clusters
more than two feet long.</p>

<p>China in modern times calls herself
the flowery kingdom, but she is
not the only one; in many other
parts roses are extensively cultivated
for the purpose of distilling from
them the ottar (<i>attah-gul</i>) of commerce;
and the landscape is often
converted for a hundred acres into
one great rose-garden. It has been
estimated that one-half of all the
varieties of roses scattered over our
gardens were originally brought from
Asia; and perhaps, counting the
fields planted there for distillation,
it may be said that one-half of all
in actual bloom adorn that quarter
of the globe. Yet the simple wild
roses of Asia, like our own wild roses,
are very inconspicuous little flowers;
it is only under the skilful hand of
the florist that each one of those
many varieties develops its own
peculiar beauties, and we obtain the
cultivated roses of the garden. The
Afghan province of Turkistan is, in
some parts, at the present day famous
for its roses. <i>Balkh</i>, the modern
capital, is so exceedingly hot
that each spring the inhabitants in a
body leave it for the little village of
Mezar; and Mezar boasts of the
most beautiful roses in the world&mdash;a
fragrant red rose which they name
<i>gul-i-surkh</i>. This peculiar variety
grows on the pretended tomb of Ali
(whose real monument is at Nedjef).
They say that these roses will flourish
in no soil but that of Mezar&mdash;an
experiment (they say) which has been
repeatedly tried and failed. Mr.
Vambéry, who was there in 1864,
says, "They are certainly more lovely
and fragrant than any I ever
saw."</p>

<p>Mr. Vambéry was sent in 1863, by
the Hungarian Academy, on a scientific
mission to Central Asia. At
Teheran he assumed the dress of a
dervish and the name of Hadji Rechid,
and in this character he joined a
company of twenty-four pilgrims,
"ragged and dirty," who were on
their return from Mecca to their far-away
home in the northeast. They
never penetrated his disguise&mdash;and
with them he traversed an extent of
country never before visited by a
European. They travelled mostly
by night, to avoid the excessive
heat. Of course much natural landscape
was lost, but we are struck
with the abundance of flowers and
gardens along this route. One which
he mentions is not fascinating, but
that was an exception; before leaving
Teheran, he visited two European
friends near there, and found
"Count G&mdash;&mdash; in a small silk tent in
a garden like a caldron; the heat
was awful! Mr. Alison was more
comfortable in his pleasant garden
at Guhalek."</p>

<p>When the pilgrims resumed their
journey at Teheran, such as were rich
enough hired a camel for two, as partners.
Mr. Vambéry soon loaned his
animal to a "dirty friend," and joined
the pedestrians, who, like true believers&mdash;followers
of the Prophet&mdash;buried
all care in one word, <i>kismet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
As they tramped on (he says),
"When their enthusiasm had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>sufficiently stimulated by reminiscences
of the gardens of Mergolan,
Namengan, and Kholand, all began
with one accord to sing a telkin
(hymn), in which I joined by screaming
as loud as I was able Allah ya
Allah!"</p>

<p>The gardens at Tabersi, a place
where they rested, were very beautiful,
also there were "abundance of
oranges and lemons, tinted yellow
and red with their dark-green leaves."
From scenes of luxuriant vegetation
they passed into the desert of Turkistan,
which extended on all sides,
far as eye could reach, like a vast
sea of sand, on one side slightly
undulating in little hills, like waves
in a storm, on the other side level
as a calm lake. Not a bird in the
air, nor a crawling thing on the earth;
"traces of nothing but departed life in
the bleaching bones of man or beast
who had perished there!" But mark
how rapid the transition once more to
beauty and fertility! On emerging
from this desolation and reaching the
frontier of Bokara, they had only
proceeded half an hour through a
country resplendent with gardens
and cultivated fields when the little
village of Kakemir lay before them.</p>

<p>Bokara (the city) is at this day the
Rome of Islam. There is a small
garden not far from it whose fame is
widely extended; for in it stands the
tomb of Baha-ed-din, the national
saint of Turkistan, second in sanctity
only to Mahomet. Pilgrimages are
made to this tomb and garden from
the most remote parts of China; and
the people of Bokara go every week.
About three hundred asses ply for
hire between the garden and the
city. It is considered a miraculous
devotion in these animals that, while
they go thither with the greatest
alacrity, only the most determined
cudgelling can turn them homeward&mdash;but
then, asses may have rural proclivities.</p>

<p>Samarcand is the most beautiful
city in Turkistan; magnificent in her
splendid gardens, and in the tale of
past glory told in her ruins. Two of
the lofty domes which greet the eye of
the stranger as he approaches are associated
with Timour&mdash;the one is
his mosque, the other his tomb,
where the warlike Tartar rests among
flowers. If we can picture the many
lofty edifices with their imposing
domes, and then suppose the whole
intermixed with closely planted gardens,
we shall have a faint idea of
the loveliness in the first view of
Samarcand. The way from Samarcand
to Karshi, south, lies for the
last two miles entirely through gardens.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>In Karshi is a large garden called
Kalenterkhane&mdash;literally, beggar's
house; but we would rather translate
it pilgrim's house. The words are
somewhat synonymous there, where
the most saintly pilgrims to the tomb
of the Prophet subsist on alms. But
this is a lovely garden on the bank
of the river, with walks and beds of
flowers; and here the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">beau monde</i>
of Karshi are to be seen daily from
about two o'clock until past sunset.
In different parts of the place the
Samovins (gigantic Russian tea-kettles)
are constantly occupied in furnishing
their customers, gathered
around them in circles two and three
deep, with the national beverage, tea.</p>

<p>We have a slight glimpse of tropical
flowers in a greenhouse, but nothing
of their native beauty and
abundance; for what a poor representative
of its class is that dwarfed
and solitary specimen, faded in color
and deficient in the perfume of a
hot climate! Then how can imagination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>fill out the entire landscape&mdash;when
vines and trees cluster together,
and twist their dark leaves and a
thousand such blossoms into one
sweet mass? Then the nard grass;
and the spicy chandan, which old
books say once covered the mountains
of Malaya; and the groves of
catalpa&mdash;not the catalpa of our latitude,
but that which opens under an
Indian sky, which the bee seeks before
all other blossoms! The morning-glory
(Ipomea) here has no fragrance,
but one which grows wild in
Southern Asia gives out a perfume
like cloves.</p>

<p>One thing we remark in Asia is
the quantity of flowers cultivated in
cities, even the largest and most
densely populated; in those of
China especially, flowers are a household
necessity. In most other lands&mdash;certainly
in ours&mdash;they are associated
with life in the country, or, at
least, they are the pleasant privilege
of the little village. Flowers in a
city are luxuries only within reach
of the wealthy. A bouquet bought
in the market-place is a rare excess
of floral expenditure, and it must
needs be trimmed and watered until
the last leaf withers. The dweller
in a labyrinth of brick walls is happy
if he can, one time in a year, escape
to grass and gardens, and refresh memory
that such things exist; but in
Asiatic cities flowers are a part of
life. A modern traveller says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After an interesting passage up the
river to Canton, the stranger enters the
suburbs of the city. Here he is surprised
to see the number of flowers and flowering-plants
which everywhere meet his
eyes ... every house-window and
courtyard is filled with them."</p></blockquote>

<p>The home of Ponqua-qua, a retired
Chinese merchant and mandarin,
was crowded with flowers and sweet
shrubs. Besides a greenhouse of
choice plants, and the customary
garden, his banqueting-hall opened
on a grove of orange-trees and camellias,
all covered with singing-birds.
In years long past, the same tastes
prevailed. Sir John Chardon, who
was in Persia in 1686, dwells on
delicious city gardens of "roses,
lilies, and peach-trees." And further
back still, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1086, lived
Atoz, a celebrated Chinese statesman
and writer. In a description
of his villa and grounds, he enumerates
hedges of roses and pomegranate-trees&mdash;banks
of odoriferous flowers&mdash;bamboo
groves with gravel
walks, willows and cedars, with the
added treasure of a library of 5,000
volumes.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In almost all pagan countries some
certain flowers, either real or imaginary,
receive a sort of veneration
from being associated with supernatural
and invisible things. Oftentimes
the plant so honored is a tree,
as the <i>Soma</i> of the Hindoos (the
Persian <i>Homa</i>), which was "the
first tree planted by Ahura-marda
by the fountain of life. He who
drinks of its juice can never die."
In the Hindoo <i>Mahabharet</i>, the
mountain Mandar, the occasional
abode of the deities, is covered with
a "twining creeper;" and India
boasts a vine well befitting to deck
the home of the gods! It is the
Bengal <i>banisteria</i> of Linnæus, the
most gigantic of all climbers. Its
blossoms are pale pink shaded with
red and yellow&mdash;so beautiful and so
fragrant that it has gained the native
name "delight of the woods."
Another mountain, Meroo&mdash;a spot
"beyond man's comprehension"&mdash;is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>adorned with trees and celestial
plants of rare virtue.</p>

<p>The <i>Pelása</i> (Butea frondosa) is
held in great veneration; it gave
name to the plain Plássey, or more
properly Pelássey. It is named in the
<i>Vedas</i>, in the laws of Menu, and in
Sanscrit poems. Few plants (says
Sir W. Jones) are considered more
venerable and holy. There was a
famous grove of it once at Crishnanagar.</p>

<p>The oriental <i>Nauclea</i> gives an odor
like wine from its gold-colored blossoms,
hence it was called Halipriga,
or beloved of Halin, the Bacchus
of India.</p>

<p>The <i>ash-tree</i> is very conspicuous
in the fables of the <i>Edda</i>, and, as
some part of the Scandinavian creed
is said to have been carried thither
from Asia, we may speak of it here.
In the fifth fable of the prose <i>Edda</i>,
the first man was named Aske (ash-tree),
and the first woman Emla (elm-tree).
We ask, Why these two especial
trees? But see further&mdash;they
were created by the sons of Bore
from two pieces of wood found floating
in the waves&mdash;and, behold, a sensible
reason!</p>

<p>An <i>ash-tree</i> is in the palace of the
gods; it typifies the universe. Its
ramifications are countless&mdash;penetrating
all things&mdash;and under its branches
the gods hold council. But
this ash-tree in various shapes is
almost the only green leaf in Scandinavian
mythology. Whatever else
Sigge (Odin) carried thither from
Asia, he left behind the countless
(and some beautiful) flower legends.
Or did they die in the icy north&mdash;and
in their place spring up that
machinery of blood and fierce passions
which made Valhalla not the
flower-clad mountain of oriental
climes, but a battle-ground, where
life was renewed only to be again
pleasurably extinguished, and where
boar's meat and mead was joy sufficient?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Flowers seem literally to pervade
almost all oriental literature, ancient
and modern. They inspire kings to
lay aside care and enact the poet.
In the middle of the last century,
one of the Chinese emperors, Kienlong,
distinguished himself by a long
poem, in which he painted the beauties
of nature and his admiration of
them. He was contemporary with
Frederick the Great, who also, as his
French friend sneeringly informs us,
always travelled with a quire of foolscap
in his pocket. On which of
the monarchs the muses smiled most
kindly, no Chinese critic is here to
tell. See-ma-kung, a Chinese statesman,
wrote a book called the <i>Garden</i>&mdash;and
very many similar might be
named.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>What can express the softer emotions
of the soul as well as flowers?
The oriental lover can find no sweeter
name for the object of his passion
than "My rosebud!" Her form is the
young palm-tree, her brow the white
jasmine, her curling locks sweet
hyacinths; her grace is the cypress;
she is a fawn among aromatic
shrubs!</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Roses and lilies are like the bright cheeks of beautiful maidens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whose ears the pearls hang like drops of dew!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Listen to a song from the Schar-Namah
of Fedusi, one of the most
celebrated Persian poets. In the
original, the lines rhyme in couplets;
this is only an extract. One can
scarce think of the maiden as walking
the earth. Surely she must have
reclined on some rose, or floated
round some lily!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"The air is perfumed with musk, and
the waters of the brooks, are they not the
essence of roses? This jasmine bending
under the weight of its flowers, this thicket
of roses shedding its perfume, seem
like the divinities of the garden. Wherever
Menisched, the daughter of Afrariab,
appears, we find men happy. It is she
who makes the garden as brilliant as the
sun; the daughter of an august monarch,
is she not a new star? She is the brilliant
star that rises over the rose and
jasmine. Peerless beauty! her features
are veiled, but the elegance of her figure
rivals the cypress. Her breath spreads
the perfume of amber around her; upon
her cheek reposes the rose. How languishing
are her eyes! Her lips have
stolen their color from the wine, but their
odor is like the essence of roses."&mdash;<i>Translated
from Sismonde de Sismondi.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Nor is it only love which levies
this tribute on flowers. We subjoin
an extract from Mesihi, another poet
whose fame is world-wide: Mesihi
the irresistible!&mdash;who paints in many
a lyric, with graphic touch, the fascinations
of beauty, and in the concluding
verse of one of them (with
happy self-complacency) thus soliloquizes:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Thou art a nightingale with a sweet voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Mesihi! when thou walkest with the damsels<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Whose cheeks are like roses!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the following subject, flowers
would be expected, but in the long
poem of which this is only a part
they are truly&mdash;the whole:</p>


<p class="center">ODE TO SPRING.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">Thou hearest the song of the nightingale, that the
vernal season approaches. The spring has
spread a bower of joy in every grove; where
the almond-tree sheds its silver blossoms.</p>

<p class="center">
Be cheerful; be full of mirth;<br />
For the spring soon passes away, it will not last.<br />
</p>

<p class="hang">The groves and hills are again adorned with all
sorts of flowers. A pavilion of roses as a
seat of pleasure is raised in the garden; who
knows which of us will live when the fair
season ends?</p>

<p class="center">
Be cheerful; etc., etc.<br />
</p>

<p class="hang">Again the dew glitters on the leaves of the lily
like the water of a bright scymitar. The dew-drops
fall through the air on the garden of
roses; listen to me if thou wouldst be delighted.</p>

<p class="center">
Be cheerful; etc., etc.<br />
</p>

<p class="hang">The time is past when the plants were sick, and
the rosebud hung its head on its bosom.
The season comes in which mountains and
steeps are covered with tulips.</p>

<p class="center">
Be cheerful; etc., etc.<br />
</p>

<p class="hang">Each morning the clouds shed gems over the
rose gardens. The breath of the gale is Tartarian
musk. Be not neglectful of duty
through too great love of the world.</p>

<p class="center">
Be cheerful; etc., etc.<br />
</p>


<p class="signature"><i>Mesihi, trans. by Sir W. Jones.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>Flowers are beautiful&mdash;but such a
profusion of them in print is not congenial
to our northern tastes, despite
other testimony in the enthusiasm of
some oriental scholars. Of course,
for those who are so happy as to
read the originals there is a charm
which is lost in translation&mdash;but
there is good reason why we fail to
sympathize. Hemmed in by cold
and snow half the year, thought,
passion, and deep feelings seek expression
through channels not made
of things visible; and their tides are
not the less deep and strong because
less demonstrative. The passionate
and imaginative literature of the East
is the outpourings of the soul under
circumstances widely different from
those under which similar effusions
here (and some of the most impassioned
and eloquent, too) have been
penned. Each calls forth different
tropes and figures&mdash;and if it is difficult
for the one side to stir up imagination
to untiring flights through
rose-gardens, equally would the poet
of Negaristan find it impossible to
picture the charms of his mistress,
and die of love or despair, before a
coal-fire in the lamp-light.</p>

<p>Who can hear of roses without
calling up an image of the nightingale,
or, in Eastern phrase, the Bulbul?
The mutual loves of the two (for
roses can love there) have made the
theme of tales and songs without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
number. Whether the story is fact
or fiction&mdash;whether the bird really
pours forth its most thrilling notes in
the atmosphere of that perfume, may
be a disputed point with "outside
barbarians," but with native writers
the belief is fully accepted. Here,
again, the repetition is wearisome;
and here, again, it is pleasant to
blame&mdash;not our lack of imagination,
but our peculiar surroundings; for,
alas! our vault empyrean is colorless
or cloudy; the melodious Bulbul a
thing to dream of; and the song,
generally, only a prosaic translation!</p>

<p>The southwestern part of Asia is
the land of spices, frankincense, and
myrrh. It is also the land of sweet
flowers, although few modern travellers
say much about them. One
reason, perhaps, is that the extreme
heat obliges the stranger to rest most
of the day, and night is for stars, not
flowers.</p>

<p>But who ever associates flowers
with Arabia? Is it the prolonged
and baleful influence of that little
wood-cut map which monopolized
a whole page in infantile geography&mdash;the
map which presents Arabia
arrayed in dots, which we were then
and there informed meant desert?
Or is it the omnipresent muffled
figures, camels, and tents which
typify Arabia in all books devoted
to juveniles? Whatever the
cause, Arabia and Arabians always
come to mind sandy and wandering.</p>

<p>Not so the Arabia which Niebuhr
traversed in the last part of the last
century, with most ample opportunities
for information.</p>

<p>Arabia, he writes, enjoys almost
constant verdure. It is true, most
of the trees shed their leaves, and
annual plants wither and are reproduced;
but the interval between the
fall of old leaves and the reappearance
of others is so short that it is
scarcely observable.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Here are found most of the plants
of two zones. On the high lands,
those of Europe and Northern or
rather Middle Asia; on the plains,
those of India and Africa, not precisely
identical with those of Europe,
but a different species or variety.
Delicious and abundant also are all
kinds of tropical fruits; and so plentiful
the melons that they serve as
food for their camels. From Arabia
were also first brought many of those
plants which we cultivate as curiosities
rather than for beauty&mdash;the <i>cactus</i>
tribe. One of the most remarkable
has its stem expanded to a globular
form, about the size of a man's head;
this rests on the earth, and from it
proceed branches bearing flowers.
In seeking for the most showy
flowers, we must turn to their forest
trees. Their forests are not very extensive,
and such as they have are
rarely seen by strangers, being quite
distant from the usual course of
travel. But the majestic height of
the trees, covered with bright-colored
and fragrant blossoms, are in marked
contrast to our own forest trees,
whose flowers, generally, can scarcely
be distinguished from the leaves.
One kind, the <i>keura</i>, is so very fragrant
that a small blossom will perfume
an entire apartment. Among
small sweet plants is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">panicratum</i>,
something like the sea-daffodil, of
the purest white; an <i>hibiscus</i>, of the
most brilliant red; and the <i>moscharia</i>,
which gives from leaves and flowers
the perfume of musk. But a catalogue
of their names alone would exceed
our limits.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"With these glorious blossoms," says
Mr. Niebuhr, "the peasantry retain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
ancient custom of crowning themselves
on certain days of joy and festivity."</p></blockquote>

<p>There is poetry in this custom.
"It is said that this nation alone has
produced more poets than all others
united" (<i>Sismondi</i>). Arabia shares
more than flowers with the rest of
Asia; she, too, joins to them poetry.
Her people have the same fertile
imagination, aversion to the restraints
of cities, love of freedom
and of nature, quick feelings and
ardent passions, which make the
true poet. The day is past&mdash;even
so long past that they have forgotten
it&mdash;when all this found expression in
compositions, which we read now,
and marvel at their rich inventions
and glowing imagery; but, nevertheless,
they are poets still! A distinguished
French author writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Through the whole extent of the Mohammedan
dominions, in Turkey, Persia,
and even to the extremity of India, a numerous
class of Arabs, both men and
women, find a livelihood in reciting these
tales to crowds who delight to forget their
annoyances in the pleasing dreams of imagination.
In the coffee-houses of the
Levant, one of these men will gather a
silent crowd around him, whom he will
excite, by his tale, to terror or pity; but
more frequently he will picture to his audience
those brilliant and fantastic visions
which are the patrimony of Eastern imaginations.
The public squares of cities
abound with these story-tellers, who fill
up, too, the dull hours of the seraglio.
Physicians recommend them often to
their patients, to soothe pain or induce
sleep; and those accustomed to the sick
modulate their voices and soften their
tones as slumber steals over the sufferer."</p></blockquote>

<p>Seven of the most remarkable old
Arabian poems, written in gold, are
hung in the Caaba, or Temple, at
Mecca; and the authors show themselves
not in the least degree behind
other orientals in heaping up flowers
and metaphors.</p>

<p>Flowers were once held, in Arabia,
of high importance in science. Next
to the sciences of mathematics, they
valued that of medicine; and many
volumes were written on their medical
plants. Somewhere about the
year 941, Aben-al-Beïther made a
botanical tour over Europe and Asia,
and a part of Africa, and, on his return,
published a volume <cite>On the Virtues
of Plants</cite>. Still earlier than this,
in 775, Al-Mansour, the second prince
of the Abassides, invited a Greek physician
to his court, and obtained
through him translations of many
learned Greek works on medicinal
plants. Such are flowers in Asia.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that, where nature
has lavished her choicest productions,
and all classes delight in cultivating
them, flowers have increased <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>.
No wonder their brilliant
hues inspired a native poet to sing:</p>

<p class="center">
"A rainbow has descended on the garden."<br />
</p>


<p class="signature"><i>Mesihi.</i></p>



<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The little colony who passed from
Asia to Egypt and first peopled that
portion of the Mediterranean shore,
in that time so long past&mdash;time without
a date&mdash;must have carried with
them many of their native plants;
for several found indigenous only in
India are found cultivated there.
Among others is the Nymphæ nelumbo,
the Lotus. This bore in India
a sacred character; the Hindoo
fable taught that the little god of
love, their Cupid, was first seen
floating down the Ganges on a lotus
leaf. In very many ways this flower
is interwoven with the Hindoo
creed, or introduced in their literature&mdash;as
in the following. It is part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of a sublime <cite>Hymn to Narayena</cite>, in
which that great Invisible is thus addressed:</p>

<span class="i0">Smiles in the bud, and glistens in the flower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That crowns each vernal bower!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>&mdash;and the radiant being, dazzling and
beautiful, who springs to life and typifies
the material universe,</p>

<p>In Egypt, when carried thither, it
naturally retained a sort of sacred
character. It is represented in their
paintings and sculptures more frequently
than any other plant; in
scenes of festivity and processions,
where it is twined with other flowers
into wreaths and chaplets; and also
in sacred scenes. Mr. Wilkinson describes
a painting found at Thebes,
in which is represented the final judgment
of a human being:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Osiris is seated on a throne, as judge
of the dead. He is attended by Isis and
Nepthys, and before him are the four
Genii of Amenti, standing on a <i>Lotus</i>.
Horus introduces the deceased whose actions
have been weighed in the scales of
Truth."</p></blockquote>

<p>Lotus buds have been often found
in the old tombs. It was also introduced
into their architecture. The
most favorite capital for a column
was a full-blown water-plant, supposed
to be the papyrus, with a bud of
the same, or a lotus bud. A large
variety of it called Lotomelia is cultivated
there still in gardens.</p>

<p>Within the last few years, some information
has been gathered relating
to the domestic life of the early
Egyptians, which was previously only
conjecture. To use the words of Sir
J. G. Wilkinson: "It has been drawn
from a comparison of the paintings,
sculptures, and monuments still existing,
with the accounts of ancient
authors."</p>

<p>On fragments of stone in different
degrees of preservation, taken from
the ruins of temples, tombs, and dead
cities, are found representations of
those who once stood here, surrounded
by all the wealth and glory, the
luxuries and magnificence of which
this is the wreck. Cut in lines which
time has not all effaced, or traced in
colors which centuries have scarcely
dimmed, we see here master and
slave, kings, priests, and people, in
all the occupations of ordinary life&mdash;a
half-obliterated record of the pursuits,
customs, habits, and tastes of
a nation so remote that their place
in the past cannot be even conjectured.
We only know, from unmistakable
evidence, that they came originally
from Asia, and lived thus in
the land of Egypt. Looking at these
fragments of their skilful workmanship,
thought goes back to an era almost
fabulous! For who can call
up even in fancy that period, when
the Nile ran through its primitive
landscape, and no foot of man had
pressed its shore! When no cities
stood in that fertile valley, and the
first stone of the first pyramid was
not yet laid! What a space of time
must have elapsed between the first
landing and the accomplishment of
all these mighty labors! There is a
mist over it all, gathered through
uncounted centuries; and although
science and research have thrown
some light, it is not much more than
the flickering torch with which one
walks at midnight; a little is revealed
near at hand, but all beyond is
darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, so much of interest
is connected with Egypt that the
least added knowledge is of value;
for not only is it mentioned by the
most ancient profane writers as mysterious
in antiquity even to them,
but it is the land of the Old Testament.
Mounds of ruins, great in
height and extent, on a branch of
the Nile, yet mark the place of <i>Tanis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
the <i>Zoan</i> of Scripture, where,
according to the Psalmist, Moses
wrought those miracles which ended
in the exodus of the Jews. On paintings
found at Thebæ, the <i>No-Ammon</i>
of Scripture, are representations of
slaves engaged in making bricks,
with taskmasters superintending them;
and although these may not be Jews,
for brick-making was a universal menial
occupation, it carries us back to
the days when "bricks without straw"
were demanded. The departure of
the Israelites from bondage, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 1491,
was in the reign of Thotmes III.,
the Pharaoh of Scripture, which records
his destruction in that day,
when,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Pharaoh went in on horseback with
his chariots and horsemen into the sea;
and the Lord brought back upon them
the waters of the sea, ... neither
did so much as one of them remain, ...
and they (the Israelites) saw the Egyptians
dead upon the sea-shore."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is remarkable that a drawing
found at Thebes represents his son
Amenoph, who succeeded him, as
coming to the throne a mere child,
under the guidance of his mother.
But we digress too far.</p>

<p>Among other things learned by
patient research, we perceive the admiration
of the early Egyptians for
flowers, and the care with which they
cultivated them. "Flowers are represented
on their dresses, chairs,
boxes, boats, on everything susceptible
of ornamentation; and flowers
and leaves are painted on the linen
found preserved in the tombs" (<i>Wilkinson</i>).</p>

<p>Pliny, in enumerating the flowers
of ancient Egypt, says the myrtle is
the most odoriferous; the reason,
doubtless, for its being so often
placed, as now found, about the
dead. At present it is only cultivated
in gardens. The other plants
Pliny names as indigenous are
the violet, rose, myosotis, clematis,
chrysanthemum, and indeed nearly
the whole catalogue of a modern
garden. Figures on their paintings
are decked with crowns and garlands
of anemone, acacia, convolvulus,
and some others. In the old tombs
are found date-trees, sycamores, and
the tamarisk.</p>

<p>There is a design at Thebes which
represents the funeral procession of
one evidently of rank. There are
cars covered with palm branches,
then female mourners, other personages,
and next a coffin on a sledge
decked with flowers.</p>

<p>In another very extensive and
elaborate painting a similar procession
is represented as crossing the
<i>lake of the dead</i>, and going from
thence to the tombs. The first boat
contains coffins decked with flowers;
in another is a high-priest, who offers
incense before a table of offerings; another
boat contains female mourners,
others male mourners, and others
chairs, boxes, etc.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Gardens are frequently represented
in the tombs of Thebes and other parts
of Egypt, many of which are remarkable
for their extent." (<i>Wilkinson.</i>)</p></blockquote>

<p>To better understand an ancient
Egyptian garden, we will first look
at their dwellings. In some few
cities where the size and something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
like a plan can be distinguished, the
streets are seen, some of them wide,
but more very narrow. Their houses,
garden-walls, public places, all but the
temples, were of brick. The plan of the
houses was similar to what now prevails
in warm climates; the principal
apartments were ranged round a
courtyard, with chambers above
them. In this court were a few
trees, some boxes of flowering-plants,
and a reservoir of water. Their
houses were generally three stories in
height.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Besides these town-houses, the
wealthy Egyptians had extensive villas,
containing spacious gardens, watered by
canals communicating with the Nile.
They had also tanks of water in different
parts of this garden, which served for
ornament, and also for irrigation when the
Nile was low. On these the master of
the place amused himself and friends
by excursions in a pleasure-boat."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a scene is represented in an
old painting. The company are
seated in the boat under a canopy;
while slaves, or at least menials,
walk along the bank and drag it after
them, in a way similar to our canal
navigation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So fond were the Egyptians of trees
and flowers, and of gracing their gardens
with all the profusion that could be obtained,
that they exacted a tribute of rare
productions from the nations tributary to
them; foreigners from distant countries
are represented as bearing plants, among
other presents, to the Egyptian kings."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To ancient Egypt we are doubtless
indebted for the invention of
artificial flowers, now so prominent
in female attire. They were made
there first from the papyrus, the
plant of which paper was made.
Some old writer relates that, when
Agesilaus was in Egypt, he was so
charmed with a kind of crowns and
chaplets which he saw in use there,
formed to resemble flowers, that he
carried many of them home with
him to Sparta. They were perhaps
imitated in Greece and became universal,
yet retained the name of the
inventors; for Pliny says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic coronis e floribus receptis paulo
mox sabiere quæ vocantur Ægyptiæ, ac
deinde hibernæ, quum terra flores negat,
ramento e comibus tincto.</span>"&mdash;<i>Plin.</i> xxi. 3.</p></blockquote>

<p>Everything that pictures the domestic
life of this people has such
great interest that it is difficult to
avoid digression. Every record of it
expresses wealth and their peculiar
tastes. Walls are profusely covered
with various designs, doors are stuccoed
to imitate costly wood, and their
carved chairs have furnished symmetrical
copies to modern art. Interspersed
with these things, we have these
traces of their flowers and gardens&mdash;a
story of their rural pleasures in that
day of glory, when they built the
pyramids&mdash;that day which has no
date! The hieroglyphics carved in
stone, on which they doubtless securely
relied for fame and a name to
the end of time, yet cover the walls
still standing of their superb temples;
they are traced on tombs&mdash;on urns&mdash;on
the rocks which surround cities&mdash;on
the sarcophagi of the dead,
even on the very linen which envelopes
them&mdash;but they speak in a lost
language! We comprehend only
one brief epitaph&mdash;that a numerous
and opulent people have entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>In the middle ages, Egypt was
still noted for flowers and valuable
aromatic shrubs and herbs. Cyrene
in the north part was remarkable
for the beauty of its adjacent country,
which even then, says a writer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
bore traces of having been in former
times a perfect flower-garden.</p>

<p>In the time of Julius Cæsar, roses
must have received particular attention
and extensive cultivation, for we
read that a ship-load of the most
fragrant was sent as a gift to Cæsar.
He received them, however, with
the graceless remark that he could
show finer ones in Rome.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF YORKE.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER V.<br />

NEW FRIENDS</h3>

<p>Enough is not only as good as a
feast, it is better; and a little less
than enough is better yet. How
dear is that affection in which we
have something to forgive! How
charming is that beauty where the
defects serve as indices to point out
how great the beauty is! How
wholesome is that salt of labor which
gives a taste to leisure! For since
the time of Eve, the point of perfection,
save with God, has been the
point of decay; and profuse wealth
has often deprived its possessor of
great riches.</p>

<p>What we arrive at by this preamble
is that the Yorkes had been
unconsciously suffering from the apathy
of satisfied wants, and were now
delighted to find that comparative
poverty brings many a pleasure in
its train.</p>

<p>"Mamma," Clara exclaimed, "I do
believe there is a certain pleasure in
making the best of things."</p>

<p>It was the morning after their arrival,
and the young woman was
standing in a chair, driving a nail to
hang on a picture. She had begun
by groaning at sight of the wall, a
white stucco painted over with brown
flower-pots, holding blossoming rose-trees.
But the cord of the frame
matched those roses, and in some
unexplained way the picture looked
well on that background.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke, looking on, smiled at
the remark. "There is a very certain
pleasure in it, my dear," she
said; "and I am glad that you have
found it out."</p>

<p>Clara considered, gave the nail
another blow, evened the picture,
and contemplated it with her head
on one side. It was an engraving
of Le Brun's picture of Alexander at
the camp of Darius. "Mamma," she
began again, "I think that Alexander
the Great ought to have had another
name after the adjective."</p>

<p>"What name, child?"</p>

<p>"Goose! Why didn't he, instead
of crying for more worlds to conquer,
try to get at the inside of the
one he had conquered the husk of?
Why did not he study botany, geology,
and&mdash;poverty?"</p>

<p>"You are right, Clara," the mother
replied. "Excess is always blinding.
Why, we might have our whole
house covered with morning-glories,
yet never see the little silver tree that
stands down in a garden of light at
the bottom of each."</p>

<p>Clara clapped her hands with delight.
"But fancy the house covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
from top to bottom with morning-glories
all in bloom! It would
be magical!"</p>

<p>"Fancy yourself falling out of that
chair," suggested Mrs. Yorke.</p>

<p>The girl stepped down, and walked
thoughtfully toward the door.
"How odd it is," she said, pausing
on the threshold, and looking back;
"I never see one truth, but immediately
I perceive another looking over its
shoulder. And the last is greater
than the first."</p>

<p>"It is perhaps an example of truth
which you see at first," Mrs. Yorke
said. "And afterward you perceive
the truth itself."</p>

<p>Clara went slowly toward the
stairs, and her mother listened after
her, expecting to hear some philosophical
remark flung down over the
balusters. Instead of that, she heard
a loud call to Betsey that the hens
and chickens were all in the parlor,
screams of laughter at the scene of
their violent expulsion, then a clear
lark-song as Clara finished her ascent.</p>

<p>Up-stairs, Melicent and Hester
were busy and cheerful, quiet, too,
till Clara came. She soon created
a breeze, and sounds of eager discussion
came down to their mother's
ears. They were laying plans for
the summer. They would have company
down from Boston, and, when
winter came, would each in turn visit
the city. They would have more
help in the house; and, in order to
pay for it, would write for publication.
Every one else wrote; why
not they? Indeed, Melicent had
appeared in print, a friendly editor
having taken with thanks some
sketches she had written between
drive and opera. "What is worth
printing is worth paying for," she said
now; "and I shall feel no reluctance
in announcing that in future
my Pegasus runs for a purse."</p>

<p>Clara had never been before the
public; but she had reams of paper
written over with stories, poems, plays,
and even sermons. She caught fire at
everything, and, in the first excitement,
dashed off some crude composition,
but seldom or never went
over it coolly. Melicent, to whom
alone she showed her productions,
had discouraged her. "You are like
Nick Bottom, and insist on doing
everything," she said. "It is a sign
of incompetence."</p>

<p>Miss Yorke was one of those hyper-fastidious
persons who establish
a reputation for critical ability simply
by finding fault with everything.
Clara, on the contrary, was supposed
to have a defective taste, because
she was always admiring, and searching
out hidden beauties.</p>

<p>But now at least Melicent condescended
to admit that her sister
might be able to accomplish something
in a small way, and it was
agreed that they should broach the
subject to the assembled family that
very evening.</p>

<p>At this encouragement, Clara rejoiced.
"You see," she exclaimed,
"I've been afraid that I might gradually
grow into one of those lugubrious
Dorcases who go round laying
everybody out."</p>

<p>Edith, following her aunt and cousins
about, rejoiced in everything. To
her, this house, with its rat-holes and
its dingy paint and plaster, was superb.
The space, the sunshine, the
air of elegance in spite of defects, the
gentle voices and ways, all enchanted
her. She found herself at home.
Her own room was the last bubble
on her cup of joy. They had given
her the middle chamber over the
front door, with a window opening
out on to the portico, and each
of the family had contributed some
article of use or adornment. Mrs.
Yorke gave an alabaster statuette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
of the Blessed Virgin, Mr. Yorke a
Douay Bible, Melicent hung an engraving
of the Sistine Madonna
where Edith's first waking glance
would fall upon it, Clara gave an
olive-wood crucifix from Jerusalem,
with a shell for holy water, Hester
brought an ivory rosary, and Carl a
missal in Latin and French, which
she must learn to read, he said.</p>

<p>They covered the floor with a soft
Turkey carpet, set up a little iron
bed, and draped it whitely, and put
a crimson valance over the lace curtain
of her window. The sisters
worked sweetly and harmoniously
in fitting up this bower for their
young cousin, and were pleased
to see her delight in what to them
were common things. When she
gratefully embraced each one, and
kissed her on both cheeks, they felt
more than repaid. Clara blushed
up with pleasure at her cousin's caress.</p>

<p>"The little gypsy has taking ways,"
Carl thought; and he said, "If you
kiss Clara that way many times, she
will have roses grow in her cheeks."</p>

<p>Then Edith went down-stairs to
her aunt, and Carl went out to assist
his father.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke was no exception to
the general cheerfulness. He found
himself more interested, while planning
his summer's work with Patrick,
than he had ever been while engaged
in the finest landscape gardening,
with an artist at his orders. Early
in the morning he had captured two
boys who were loitering about, and
they willingly engaged themselves
for the day to pick up wheel-barrow
loads of small stones, and throw them
into the mud of the avenue.</p>

<p>"Mr. Yorke has got himself into
business," Patrick remarked to Carl.
"That avenue has a wonderful appetite
of its own."</p>

<p>Carl repeated this observation to
his father. "And I think Pat is
right," he added. "See how complacently
that mud takes in all you
throw to it. It seems to smile over
the last load of pebbles."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke put up his eye-glasses.
He always did that when he wished
to intensify a remark or a glance.
"I intend to make these avenues
solid, if I have to upset the whole
estate into them," he remarked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke sat in a front window
holding an embroidery-frame, and
Edith occupied a stool at her feet.
The child had told all her story;
her recollections of her mother, her
life with the Rowans, of Captain
Cary, and her ring. But of Mr.
Rowan's burial she said nothing.
That was to remain a secret with
those who had assisted.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Yorke occasionally
dropped her work, and sat looking
out at her husband and son, Edith
caressed the hand lying idly on that
glowing wool, and held her own slender
brown fingers beside those fair
ones, for a contrast. She could not
enough admire her aunt's snow-drop
delicacy, rich hair, and soft eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke was too much engrossed
to notice his wife; but Carl looked
up now and then for a glance and
smile.</p>

<p>"Do you recollect anything that
happened when you were a little
girl, Aunt Amy?" Edith asked.</p>

<p>The lady smiled and sighed in the
same breath. "I was this moment
thinking of a tea-party I had on that
large rock you can just see at the
right. I had heard my father read
<cite>Midsummer-Night's Dream</cite>, and my
fancy was captivated by it. So I invited
Titania, Oberon, and all the
fairies, and they came. It was an
enchanting banquet. The plates
were acorn-cups, the knives and
forks were pine-needles, the cakes
were white pebbles, and we drank
drops of dew out of moss vases."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've read that play too," Edith
said brightly. "Mr. Rowan had it.
And I read about Ariel. But I
didn't like Caliban nor Bottom, and
I think it was a shame to cheat Titania
so. Do you remember anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I was five or six
years old, my father brought home a
new map of the State of Maine, and
hung it on that wall opposite. It
was bright and shining, and had
the name in great letters across the
whole. My father held me up before
it in his arms, and said I should
have a silver quarter if I would tell
him what the great letters spelt.
How I tried! not so much for the
silver, though I wanted it, as for the
honor of success, and to please my
father. But I couldn't make less
than two syllables of it. To me
M, A, I, N, E, spelt Mainé. But
my father gave me the quarter. I suppose
he thought that the language,
and not I, was at fault."</p>

<p>"I don't see why letters should be
put into words when they are not
needed there," Edith remarked. "I
would like to have them left out. It
makes a bother, and takes time."</p>

<p>The child did not know that she
was uttering revolutionary sentiments,
and that the reddest of red republicanism
lurked in her speech.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke mused over her embroidery,
set a golden stitch in a violet,
drew it too tightly, and had to
loosen it.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Edith exclaimed, her memory
catching on that thread. "That
makes me recollect that I knit a
tight strip into the heel of Mr. Rowan's
stocking, and I can see just how
it looked. But I didn't know it
then."</p>

<p>There was a sound of wheels, and
Mrs. Yorke looked up to see a carriage
drawn by a pair of greys coming
up the avenue. Major Cleaveland
had lost no time in calling on
his neighbors.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke went down to meet his
visitor, the road being too penitential
for travel, and the two walked up
together. They had known each
other by sight in Boston, where the
major spent his winters, but had no
farther acquaintance. Now they met
cordially, and stood a while talking
in the portico before going in to see
the ladies. Major Cleaveland was
fresh-faced, pleasant-looking, and
rather pompous in manner. A deep
crape on his hat proclaimed him a
widower. Indeed, Mrs. Cleaveland
had not long survived young Mrs.
Yorke, and the two had, ere this, let
us hope, amicably settled the question
of precedence.</p>

<p>The visit was an agreeable one to
all, though it was evident that the
visitor felt more at ease with the ladies
than with his host. He was slightly
disconcerted by Mr. York's piercing
eyes, aquiline nose, and emphatic
mode of speech, and on the whole
found him rather too dominant in
manner. It appeared that there
were to be two lords in Seaton instead
of one.</p>

<p>We doubt if the most amiable of
Bengal lions would be altogether
pleased at seeing his proper jungle
invaded by even the politest of Nubian
lions; and we may be pretty
sure that the lioness would hear in
private more than one remark detrimental
to the dignity of that odious
black monster with his desert manners.
And in return, it is not unlikely
that the African desert-king might
sneer at his tawny brother as rather
an effeminate creature. It is not the
lionesses alone who have rivalries.
Certain it is that, when Major
Cleaveland had gone, and the ladies
chose to praise him very highly,
Melicent pronouncing him to be a
superior person, Mr. Yorke saw fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
to greet the remark with one of his
most disagreeable smiles.</p>

<p>"Don't you think so, papa?" asks
Melicent.</p>

<p>"He has intellectual tastes, but no
intellectual power," answered "papa"
most decidedly. "He has glimmerings."</p>

<p>But for all that, the call was a pleasant
one, the gentleman lingering half
an hour, and then going with reluctance.
The presence of Edith had caused
him a momentary embarrassment.
He was not sure that it would be
delicate to remember having ever
seen her before, and yet her smiling
eyes seemed to expect a recognition.
But Mrs. Yorke brought her forward
immediately. "Edith tells me you
are an acquaintance," she said, "and
that you have been very kind to her."</p>

<p>Before going, Major Cleaveland
placed his pews in the meeting-house
at their disposal, and offered to send
a carriage for them the next morning.
"I have two of the best pews
in Dr. Martin's church," he said, "and
since my boys went away to school,
there has been no one but myself to
occupy them. There is room in
each for six persons; and I sit in one,
and put my hat in the other. Of
course, we look like two oases in a
red velvet desert. Do come, ladies,
and make a garden of the place."</p>

<p>They all went out to the portico
with him when he took leave, and
he went away charmed with their
cordiality, and with several new ideas
in his mind. One of the first effects
of this enlightenment was that the
major appeared at meeting the next
day without a crape on his hat.</p>

<p>It was a fatiguing day, that Saturday;
but at sunset their labors were
over, all but arranging the books.
The boxes containing these Mr. Yorke
had brought into the sitting-room
after tea, and the young people assisted
him. He classified his library
in a way of his own. Metaphysical
works he placed over science, since
"metaphysics is only physics etherized,"
he said. One shelf, named the
Beehive, was filled with epigrams and
satires. History and fiction were indiscriminately
mingled. Mr. Yorke
liked to quote Fielding&mdash;"pages
which some droll authors have been
facetiously pleased to call the history
of England."</p>

<p>"There are certain time-honored
lies which every intelligent and well-informed
person is expected to be
familiar with," he said. "Not to
know Hume, De Foe, Fox, Cervantes,
Froude, Le Sage, etc., argues one's
self unknown."</p>

<p>In a corner of the case was the
Olympus where Mr. Yorke's especial
intellectual favorites were placed&mdash;among
them Bolingbroke, Carlyle,
Emerson, and Theodore Parker.
"They are fine pagans," he said of
the two last.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke mused in the chimney-corner,
her head resting on her hand,
the smouldering fire throwing a faint
glow up in her face. Edith sat by
a table looking over William Blake's
illustrations of Blair's <cite>Grave</cite>&mdash;a set
of plates that had just been sent
them from England. The daughters
took books from the boxes, and called
their names; Carl, mounted on
steps, placed the upper ones; and
Mr. Yorke did everything they did,
and more. He scolded, ordered,
commented, and now and then opened
a book to read a passage, or give
an opinion of the author.</p>

<p>"Don't put Robert Browning beside
Crashaw!" he cried out. "You
might as well put Lucifer beside St.
John."</p>

<p>"Why, I thought you admired
Browning, papa," Melicent said.</p>

<p>"So I do; but half his lustre is
phosphorescent. It is a spiritual decay,
and the lightnings of a superb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
mind. But Crashaw is an angel.
Edith must read him."</p>

<p>Looking at such a library, a Catholic
remembers well that the serpent
still coils about the tree of knowledge,
hisses in the rustling of it, and
poisons many a blossom with his
breath. Worse yet, though the antidote
is near, few or none take it.
Those for whom slanders against the
church are written, never read the
refutation. How many who read in
Motley's <cite>Dutch Republic</cite> that absolutions
were sold in Germany at so
many ducats for each crime, the
most horrible crimes, either committed
or to be committed, having an
easy price&mdash;how many of those readers
ask if it be true, or glance at a
page which disproves the slander?
Who on reading Prescott looks to
the other side to see exposed his insinuations,
his false deductions from
true facts? How many of those
countless thousands who have been
nurtured on the calumnies of Peter
Parley, drawing them in from their
earliest childhood, have ever read a
page on which his condemnation is
written? And later, in the periodical
literature of the day, with a thousand
kindred attacks, how many of
those who, within a few months,
have read in the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>
Mrs. Child's impertinent article on
Catholicism and Buddhism, stopped
to see that her argument, such as it
was, was directed less against the
church than against Christianity itself?
or looked in Marshall's <cite>Christian
Missions</cite> to find that the resemblance
is simply a reflection of the
early labors of the only missionaries
who have ever influenced Asia&mdash;the
faint echoes of "the voice of one
crying in the wilderness"?</p>

<p>But it is vain to multiply names.
"The trail of the serpent is over
them all."</p>

<p>The books in their places, Mr.
Yorke seated himself to look over a
casket of precious coins and rings.
"Wouldn't you think that papa was
dreaming over some old love-token
of his boyhood?" whispered Clara
to her brother.</p>

<p>Her father had fallen into a dream
over an old ring with a Latin posy
in it; and what he saw was this: a
blue sky, jewel-blue, over Florence,
in whose air, says Vasari, "lies an
immense stimulus to aspire after
fame and honor." He saw a superb
garden, peopled with sculptured
forms, and three men standing before
an antique marble. It is Bertoldo,
Donatello's pupil, young Michael
Angelo, and Lorenzo the Magnificent,
the glory of Florence, whose
face all the people and all the children
love; and they are walking in
the gardens of San Marco, the art-treasury
of the Medici. Farther off,
moving slowly under the trees, with
his hands behind his back, and his
eagle face bent in thought, is the
learned and elegant Poliziano. Suddenly
he pauses, a smile flashes
across his face, he brings his hands
forward to clap them together, and
goes to meet the three who have respected
his seclusion. "How now,
Poliziano," laughs the duke, "do we
not deserve to hear the result of
those musings which we were so
careful not to intrude upon?" And
the scholar, whose epigrams no less
than his Greek and his translations
are the pride of the court, bows
lowly, and repeats the very posy engraved
on this ring over which Mr.
Yorke now dreams in the nineteenth
century, in the woods of Maine, in
April weather.</p>

<p>The bright Italian picture faded.
Mr. Yorke sighed and put the magical
ring away, and took up a volume
of Villemain's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Littérature
Française</i>, turning the leaves
idly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Melicent made a slight movement,
and begged to be heard. "We girls
have been talking matters over to-day,"
she said, "and would like to
submit our plans to you. We have
divided the house-work into three
parts, which we take in rotation. One
is to be lady's-maid and companion
for mamma, another is to make the
beds and dust all the rooms, and the
third will set the table, wash the
china and silver, and trim the
lamps."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke looked up quickly as
his daughter began, but immediately
dropped his eyes again, and sat with
a flushed face, frowning slightly. It
was his first intimation that his daughters
had not only lost society and
luxury, but that their personal ease
was gone. They would have to perform
menial labors.</p>

<p>"I think your arrangement a very
good one, Melicent," Mrs. Yorke replied
tranquilly. She had all the
time seen the necessity. "But the
post of lady's-maid will be a sinecure.
However, let it stay. It will be a
time of leisure for each."</p>

<p>"Cannot Betsey do the work?"
Mr. Yorke asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Why, papa!" Clara cried out,
"Betsey can scarcely spare time out
of the kitchen to do the sweeping.
When we come to making butter, we
girls will have to help in the fine
ironing."</p>

<p>"I can churn!" Mr. Yorke exclaimed
desperately.</p>

<p>"My dear!" expostulated his wife.</p>

<p>"I churned once when I was a
boy," he protested; "and the butter
came."</p>

<p>They all laughed, except Hester,
who affectionately embraced her father's
arm. "Why shouldn't the
butter come when you churn, dear
papa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"You must have been in very
good humor, sir," said Carl slily.</p>

<p>"We don't mean to do this sort
of work long," Melicent resumed.
"There is no merit in doing servile
work, if one can do better. Clara
and I will write, and so pay for extra
help. I think"&mdash;very indulgently&mdash;"that,
with practice, Clara may
make something of a writer. I shall
write a volume of European travels.
On the whole, looking at our reverses
in this light, they seem fortunate.
Living here in quiet, we can accomplish
a literary labor for which we
should never otherwise have found
time."</p>

<p>"That is true," Mr. Yorke said;
but his look was doubtful and troubled.
"Still, Melicent, I would not
have you too confident. I would
advise you to try a story. It would
be more likely to sell. Europe <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réchauffée</i>
has become a drug in the
market, and our experiences abroad
were pretty much what those of others
are. A vagabond adventurer
would have a much better chance of
catching public attention."</p>

<p>Edith gazed in awe at her companions.
She was in the midst of
people who made books! She saw
them face to face. So might pretty
Psyche have gazed when first her
husband's celestial relatives received
her, when she saw Juno among her
peacocks, Minerva laying aside her
helmet, Hebe pouring nectar. This,
then, is Olympus!</p>

<p>"If you write a story, do take one
suggestion from me, Melicent," Carl
said. "Pray give your hero and
heroine brushes to dress their hair
with. Have you observed that even
the finest characters in books have
to use a broom? The hair is always
<em>swept</em> back."</p>

<p>Miss Yorke did not notice this
triviality. She was looking rather
displeased.</p>

<p>"I don't want to discourage you,
daughter," her father went on. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
you must recollect that it is one
thing to give a sketch to an editor,
who is a friend, and dines with you,
and another thing to offer him a
book, which he is expected to pay
for. Then he must look to the market
and his reputation. Some of the
finest writers in the world have described
these very scenes which you
would describe. Can you tell more
of Rome than Madame de Staël has?
or paint a more enchanting picture
of Capri than that of Hans Andersen?
If not, you run the risk of
reminding your reader of Sidney
Smith's reply to the dull tourist who
held out his walking-stick, boasting
that it had been round the world.
'Yes; and still it is a stick!' says
Sidney."</p>

<p>Miss Yorke held her head very
high, and her color deepened. "I
will then put my <span class="smcap">MS.</span> into the fire,"
she said in a quiet tone, casting her
eyes down.</p>

<p>Her father gave an impatient shrug.
"Not at all!" he replied. "But you
will take advice, and try to think
that you are not above criticism."</p>

<p>"Clara has an idea," Carl interposed.
He had been bending over
some papers with his younger sister.
"She also turns to travels, but very
modestly. She calls them gleanings,
and her motto is from De Quincey:
'Not the flowers are for the pole,
but the pole is for the flowers.' Here
is the preface. Shall I read it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I am afraid of papa!" Clara
cried, blushing very much. But
Mr. Yorke, who only now learned
that his second daughter was also a
scribbler, laughingly promised to be
lenient; and she suffered herself to
be persuaded. They all looked kindly
on her, even Melicent, in spite of
her own mortification; and Carl
read:</p>

<p>"I do not presume to write a volume
descriptive of European travel.
Many, great and small, have been in
that field, some reaping wheat, others
binding up tares. These leaves
are offered by one who gathered a
few nodding things which no one
valued, seeing them there, but which
some one may, if fortune favor, smile
at, since they grew there. One such
might say: You're but a weed; but
you grew in a chink of crumbling
history; I know where, for I measured
the arch, and sketched the colonnade.
And I recognize the green
leaves of you, and the silver thread
of a root, with a speck of rich old
soil clinging yet. And, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i>, I
saw there a child asleep in the shade,
with a group of spotted yellow lilies
standing guard, as if they had sprung
up since, and because she had closed
her eyes, and might change to a
group of tigers if you should go too
near. She had long eyelashes, and
she smiled in her sleep.</p>

<p>"I do not claim to be an artist, O
travelled reader! but I stretch a hand
to touch the artist in you."</p>

<p>"That isn't bad," Mr. Yorke said
immediately. "And your motto is
very pretty. I am glad to have you
familiar with De Quincey. He is good
company. He is a man who does
not overlook delicate hints, and he is
respectful and just to children. He
annoys me sometimes by a weak
irony, and by explaining too much;
but, I repeat, he is good company."</p>

<p>Immediately Clara passed from
the deeps to the heights. Her bosom
heaved, her eyes flashed. She felt
herself famous.</p>

<p>"Now let us hear a chapter of the
gleanings," said her father.</p>

<p>"Why, I haven't written anything
but the preface," Clara was forced
to acknowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke smiled satirically. Clara
was notable in the family for making
great beginnings which came to nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I have other things finished,"
she said eagerly, and brought out a
poem. All her fears were gone.
She was full of confidence in herself.</p>

<p>We spare the reader a transcription
of this production. Mephistopheles
had a good deal to do with
it, and it was probably written during
some midnight ecstasy, when the
young woman had been reading
Faust. It was meant to be very
fearful; and as the authoress read it
herself, all the terrible passages were
rendered with emphasis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke listened with a doubtful
face. The reading was quite out
of her gentle mental sphere; and
Carl's hand shaded his eyes, which
had a habit of laughing when his
lips did not. Mr. Yorke, with his
mouth very much down at the corners,
his eyes very much cast down,
and his eyebrows very much raised,
glanced over a page of the book in
his hand.</p>

<p>"I chanced to-night across the
first touch of humor I have seen in
Villemain," he said. "He quotes
Crébillon: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'Corneille à pris le ciel,
Racine la terre; il ne me restait plus
que l'enfer. Je m'y suis jetté à corps
perdu.' 'Malheureusement,'</i> says Villemain,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'malheureusement il n'est pas
aussi infernal qu'il le croit.'</i>"</p>

<p>Without raising his face, Mr. Yorke
lifted his eyes, and shot at the poetess
a glance over his glasses.</p>

<p>Instantly her face became suffused
with blushes, and her eyes with
tears.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke spoke hastily. "I am
sure, papa, the dear girls deserve
every encouragement for their intentions
and efforts. I am grateful and
happy to see how nobly they are
taking our troubles; and I cannot
doubt that, with their talents and
good-will, they will accomplish something.
But it is too late to talk more
about it to-night. You must be
tired, and my head is as heavy as
a poppy. Shall we have prayers?"</p>

<p>She rose in speaking, went to the
table, and, standing between her two
elder daughters, with an arm round
the neck of each, kissed them both,
tears standing in her eyes. "If you
never succeed in winning fame, my
dears," she said, "I shall still be
proud and fond of you. Your sweet,
helpful spirit is better than many
books."</p>

<p>The Yorkes had never given up,
though they had often interrupted,
the habit of family devotion. Now
it was tacitly understood that the
custom should be a regular one. So
Hester brought the Bible and prayer-book,
and placed them before her
father, and her sisters folded their
hands to listen.</p>

<p>"I think we should have Betsey
in," Mrs. Yorke said; and Melicent
went to ask her.</p>

<p>Betsey and Patrick were seated at
opposite sides of a table drawn up
before the kitchen fireplace, where a
hard-wood knot burned in a spot of
red gold. One of the windows was
open, and through it came a noise
of full brooks hurrying seaward, and
a buzzing, as of many bees, that
came from the saw-mills on the river.
Betsey was darning stockings, and
Pat reading the <cite>Pilot</cite>.</p>

<p>"We are to have prayers now,"
Melicent said, standing in the door.
"Will you come in, Betsey?"</p>

<p>Betsey slowly rolled up the stocking,
and stabbed the darning-needle
into the ball of yarn. "Well, I
don't care if I do," she answered
moderately. "It can't do me no
great harm."</p>

<p>Melicent gave her a look of surprise,
and returned to the sitting-room,
leaving the doors ajar.</p>

<p>"Come, Pat," said Betsey, "put
away that old Catholic paper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
come in and hear the Gospel read.
I don't believe you ever heard a
chapter of it in your life."</p>

<p>"No more did St. Peter nor St.
Paul," answered Patrick, without
lifting his eyes from the paper. He
had been reading over and over one
little item of news from County Sligo,
where he was born. The old
priest who had baptized him was
dead; and with the news of his
death, and the description of his funeral,
how many a scene of the past
came up! He was in Ireland again,
poor, but careless and happy. His
father and mother, now old and lonely
in that far land, were still young,
and all their children were about
them. The priest, a man in his
prime, stood at their cottage door,
with his hand on little Norah's head.
They all smiled, and Norah cast her
bashful eyes down. Now the priest
was white-haired, and dead, and little
Norah had grown to be a careworn
mother of many children. The man
was in no mood to hear taunts.
Read the Gospel? Why, it was like
reading a gospel to look back on
that group; for they were true to
the faith, and poor for the faith's
sake, and they had lived pure lives
for Christ's love, and those who had
died had died in the Lord.</p>

<p>"But Peter and Paul wrote," answered
Betsey. "And what they
wrote is the law of God. You'll
never be saved unless you read it."</p>

<p>"Many a one will be damned who
does read it!" retorted Patrick wrathfully.
"What's the use of reading
a law-book, if you don't keep the
law?"</p>

<p>"Oh! if you're going to swear,
I'll go," Betsey replied with dignity,
and went. But she took care to
leave the doors ajar behind her.</p>

<p>It was true, Patrick did not read
the Bible much; but he knew the
Gospels and Psalms in the prayer-book,
and was as familiar with the
truths of Scripture as many a Bible
student. But he had heard it so be-quoted
by those who were to him
not much better than heathen, and
so made a bone of contention by
snarling theologians, that he did not
much care to read the book itself.
He could not now avoid hearing it
read without leaving the room; and
he would not have had them hear
him show that disrespect to them.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke's voice had a certain
bitter, rasping quality, which, with
his fine enunciation, was very effective
in some kinds of reading. In
the sacred Scriptures it gave an impression
of grandeur and sublimity.
Patrick dropped his paper, and listened
to the story of the martyrdom
of St. Stephen. He knew it well,
but seemed now to hear it for the
first time. He saw no book, he
heard a voice telling how the martyr
stood before his accusers, with "his
face as the face of an angel," and
flung back their accusation upon
themselves, till "they were cut to
the heart," and "gnashed with their
teeth at him."</p>

<p>"Faith!" he muttered excitedly;
"but he had them there!"</p>

<p>As Mr. Yorke went on with the
story, and the saint, looking steadfastly
upward, declared that he saw
the heavens open, and the Son of
Man standing at the right hand of
God, Patrick rose unconsciously to
his feet, and blessed himself. To his
pure faith and unhackneyed imagination
the scene was vividly clear. He
heard the outcry of the multitude,
saw them rush upon their victim,
drive him out of the city and stone
him, till he fell asleep in the Lord.</p>

<p>"'And a young man named Saul
was consenting to his death,'" said
the voice.</p>

<p>"Glory be to God!" exclaimed
Patrick, taking breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>The prayer that followed grated
on his feelings. The reader lost his
fire, and merely got through this part
of the exercises. Evidently, Mr.
Yorke did not believe that he was
praying. Neither did Patrick believe
that he was.</p>

<p>The next morning Major Cleaveland's
carriage came to take them to
what they called church. Melicent
and Clara had already set out to
walk. Carl stayed at home with
Edith, and only Mr. and Mrs. Yorke
and Hester drove. They overtook
the others at the steps of the meeting-house,
and found Major Cleaveland
waiting in the porch for them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke was one of those sweet,
unreasoning souls who fancy themselves
Protestant because they were
born and trained to be called so,
but who yield as unquestioning an
obedience to their spiritual teachers
as any Catholic in the world. She
unconsciously obeyed the recommendation,
"Don't be consistent, but be
simply true." Absurdly illogical in
her theology, she followed unerringly,
as far as she knew, her instincts
of worship, and the opinions that
grew naturally from them. It would
be hard to define what her husband
thought and believed of Dr. Martin's
sermon. He did not find it a feast
of reason, certainly; but he swallowed
it from a grim sense of duty,
though with rather a wry face. The
young ladies knew about as much of
theology as Protestant ladies usually
do, and that is&mdash;nothing. They left
it all to the minister; and, provided
he did not require them to believe
anything disagreeable, were quite satisfied
with him.</p>

<p>Coming home, they entertained
their brother with a laughing account
of their experience. The major had
escorted Melicent to her seat, to the
great amusement of the two sisters
following. For Miss Yorke, sublimely
conscious of herself, and that they
were the observed of all observers,
had walked with a measured tread,
utterly irrespective of her companion;
and the major, equally important,
and slightly confused by his hospitable
cares, had neglected to modify
his usual short, quick steps. The result
was, as Clara said, that "they
chopped up the aisle in different metres,"
thus oversetting the gravity of
the younger damsels following. Then
their minds had been kept on the
rack by an old gentleman in the
pew in front of them, who went to
sleep several times, following the customary
programme: first a vacant
stare, then a drooping of the eyelids,
then a shutting of them, then several
low bows, finally a sharp, short
nod that threatened to snap his head
off, followed by a start, and a manner
that resentfully repudiated ever
having been asleep.</p>

<p>"Poor old gentleman!" Mrs. Yorke
said. "The day was warm, and Dr.
Martin's voice lulling. How could
he help it?"</p>

<p>"But, mamma," Clara answered,
"he could have pinched himself; or
I would have pinched him cheerfully."</p>

<p>A good many people called on
them that week, and the family were
surprised to find among them persons
of cultivated minds. Beginning by
wondering what they were to talk
about with these people, they found
that they had to talk their best.</p>

<p>They had made the mistake often
made by city people, taking for granted
that the finest and most cultivated
minds are to be found in town. They
forgot that city life fritters away the
time and attention by a thousand
varied and trivial distractions, so that
deep thought and study become almost
impossible. They neglect to
observe that cities would degenerate
if they were not constantly supplied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
with fresh life from the country;
that the fathers that achieve are followed
by the sons that dawdle, that
the artist gives birth to the dilettante.
'Tis the country that nurses the tree
which bears its fruit in the city. But,
also, the country often hides its treasures,
and the poet's fancy of "mute,
inglorious Miltons" is as true as it
is poetical.</p>

<p>In the country painting and sculpture
and architecture are, it is true,
only guessed at; but they have nature,
which, as Sir Thomas Browne
says, "is the art of God;" and books
are appreciated there as nowhere
else. The country reader dives like
a bee into the poet's verse, and lingers
to suck up all its sweetness; the
city reader skims it like a butterfly. In
the country the thinker's best thought
is weighed, and pondered, and niched;
in the city it is glanced at, and
dismissed. In those retired nooks are
women who quote Shakespeare over
their wash-tubs, and read the English
classics after the cows are milked,
while their city sisters ponder the
fashions, or listen to some third-rate
lecturer, whose only good thought is,
perhaps, a borrowed thought.</p>

<p>Still, all honor to that strong, swift
life which grinds a man as under a
millstone, and proves what is in
him; which sharpens his sluggishness,
breaks the gauze wings of him, and
forces him out of a coterie and into
humanity.</p>

<p>One day Dr. Martin called. Mrs.
Yorke and her daughters, with Carl,
were out searching for May-flowers,
and there was no one at home to receive
him but Mr. Yorke and Edith.
Dr. Martin and the child met with
great coldness, and instantly separated;
but the two gentlemen kept up a
conversation, though neither was quite
at his ease. They needed a gentler
companionship to bring them together.
The minister was a man of good
mind and education, and a kind heart;
but his prejudices were strong and
bitter, and the presence of that little
"papist" disconcerted him. He
soon took occasion, in answer to
Mr. Yorke's civil inquiries respecting
the churches in Seaton, to give expression
to this feelings.</p>

<p>"We have, of course, a good many
papists, but all of the lowest class,"
he said; "I have tried to do something
for them; but they are so ignorant,
and so enslaved by their priests,
that it is impossible to induce them
to listen to the Gospel."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke drew himself up.
"Perhaps you are not aware that
my niece, Miss Edith Yorke, is a
Catholic," he said in his stateliest
manner.</p>

<p>Edith, standing in a window near,
had not made a sound; but she looked
at the minister, and fired at him
two shots out of her two eyes. He
in turn raised himself with an offended
air at Mr. Yorke's reproof.</p>

<p>"I was certainly not aware that
your sympathies were with the papists,
sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Neither are they," was the cold
reply. "But I profess to be a gentleman,
and I try to be a Christian.
One of my principles is never to insult
the religious beliefs of another."</p>

<p>"But," objected the minister, stifling
his anger, "if you never attack their
errors, you lose the chance of enlightening
them."</p>

<p>"Doctor," Mr. Yorke said with a
slight laugh, "I don't believe you
can ever enlighten a man's mind by
pounding a hole in his head."</p>

<p>And so they dropped that part of the
subject. But Mr. Yorke thought it
best to define his own position, and
thus prevent future mistakes.</p>

<p>"I believe in God," he said. "A
man is a fool who does not. And
I believe that the Bible was written
by men inspired by him. But there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
is no one thing in it for the truth of
which I would answer with my life.
It is the old fable of the divinity visiting
earth wrapped in a cloud.
Somewhere hidden in the Bible is
the truth, but I see it as in a glass
darkly. I think as little about it as
possible. To study would be to entangle
myself in a labyrinth. It is
natural and necessary for man to worship;
but it is neither natural nor
reasonable for him to comprehend
what he worships. To take
in the divine, your brain must
crack."</p>

<p>The minister perceived that argument
was useless, and shortly after
took leave.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VI.<br />

BOADICEA.</h3>

<p>Within a few weeks came a letter
from Mrs. Rowan to Edith. It is
not natural for people to write in
their own way&mdash;that comes with education
and practice; but this letter
breathed the writer's very self. It
radiated a timid distress. She had
surprising news to tell. Instead of
being in a tenement of her own,
among plain people whom she would
feel at ease with, she was installed as
housekeeper in what seemed to her
a very magnificent establishment.
Mr. Williams, her employer, was an
importing merchant, and his family
consisted of a daughter, eighteen
years of age, and an awful sister-in-law
who lived in the next street, but
visited his house at all hours of day
or evening, superintending minutely
his domestic arrangements. This
gentleman knew Major Cleaveland
well, and had for many years had
business relations with Captain Cary.
Indeed, it was their sailor friend who
had procured the situation for her,
and insisted on her taking it. She
had refused as long as she could,
but Dick himself joining against her,
she had finally yielded. Mr. Williams
was very kind. He had assured
her that he did not want a city
housekeeper, but some quiet, honest
countrywoman to be in the house
with his daughter, and see that the
servants did not rob him.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of this letter,
Mrs. Rowan added that Dick sent
his respects, at which Edith's heart
sank with disappointment. Where
was the hearty affection, the eager
remembrance she had looked for?</p>

<p>The child would have been less
indignant had she known what pains
Dick was really taking for her sake.
He had searched out, and borrowed
or bought all the printed correspondence
of famous letter-writers that
were to be had for love or money,
and was studying them as models.
He had also invested extravagantly
in stationery, and was striving to
bend his clear, clerkly penmanship
to something more elegant and gentlemanlike.
Even while she was accusing
him of forgetfulness, he was
carefully copying his tenth letter to
her.</p>

<p>But still, Edith was not to blame,
though she was mistaken. Affection
has no right to be silent.</p>

<p>After a few days, however, came
his farewell before sailing for the
East. Over this note, Edith shed
bitter tears, as much for the manner
as for the matter of it. For Dick,
with an eye to Mrs. Yorke as a reader,
had composed a very dignified
epistle after the manner of Doctor
Johnson. Poor Dick! who could
have written the most eloquent
letter in the world, if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
poured his heart out freely and simply.</p>

<p>The child had scant time allowed
her for mourning, for her studies began
immediately. The family were
all her teachers, and she began at
once with music and languages. The
common branches were taught indirectly.
Geography she learned by
looking out on the maps places mentioned
in their reading or conversation.
History she learned chiefly
through biography. For arithmetic,
some one gave her every day a problem
to solve. She added up household
expenses, measured land, laid out
garden-beds, weighed and measured
for cooking. Her study was all living:
not a dead fact got into her
mind. She read a great deal besides,
travels, all that she could find relating
to the sea, and poetry. As her
mind became interested, she settled
once more into harmony with herself,
and her feelings grew quiet.
The impression left by Dick's strange
behavior after their parting faded
away, and she remembered only his
last fervent protestation: "I'll climb,
Edith, I'll climb!" How it was to
be, and what it really meant, she
knew not; but the old faith in him
came back. "What Dick said he'd
do, he always did."</p>

<p>She associated him with all she
read or heard of foreign lands and
waters. He had sailed through phosphorescent
seas by night, under wide-eyed
stars, while the waves tossed in
fire from his prow, and trailed in fire
in his wake. He had lain in the
warm southern ocean, where the tides
are born, had held his breath during
that pause when all the waters of
the earth hang balanced, and swung
his cap as he felt the first soft pulse
of the infant tidal wave that was to
grow till its rim should cast a wreath
of foam on every shore from the
North Pole to the South. Palms and
the banyan-tree, pines almost huge
enough to tip the earth over, each in
turn had shaded his head. His venturesome
feet had trod the desert
and the jungle. Jews and Moslems
had looked after him as he sauntered
through their crowded bazaars&mdash;the
bright-eyed, laughing sailor-boy!
Norsemen had smiled as they saw
his hair blown back and his face kindled
by the tempest. It was always
Dick to the fore of everything.</p>

<p>On one of those spring mornings,
Carl, wandering through the woods,
came out into the road in front of
an old school-house that stood at
the edge of the village. The door
was open, and showed a crowd of
children at their studies inside. On
the green in front of the door lay a
log, and on the log sat a deplorable-looking
little man. He was neither
young nor old, but seemed to be
stranded on some bleak age which
time had forgotten. His clothes
were gentlemen's clothes cut down
and patched. A hat that was too
large for him reached from his forehead
to his neck. It was not crushed,
but it was shabby, and drooped
sorrowfully in the brim. His hair
was thin and long, and patted down.
Tears rolled over his miserable face
as he sat and looked in at the children
saying their lessons in a long
class. He did not cover his face in
weeping, but lifted his eyebrows, wiped
the tears occasionally, and continued
to gaze.</p>

<p>Carl was one of the last persons
in the world to intrude on another,
or allow any intrusion on himself,
but after a moment's hesitation he
ventured to approach this pitiful
little figure, and ask what ailed him.</p>

<p>The man showed no surprise on
being addressed, but poured out his
grief at once. His name was Joseph
Patten, he was poor and had a
large family, and was obliged to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
town help. As a condition of
that help, he must give up one of
his children to be bound out to
work, or adopted into a family. The
parents were allowed to choose which
child they would part with, and
"Joe," as he was called by everybody,
was now trying to make up his
mind. His story was told in a
whimpering voice, and with many
tears, and the listener was quite as
much provoked to laugh as to weep.</p>

<p>"It isn't easy to part with your
own flesh and blood, sir," said Joe.
"There's Sally, my oldest girl, named
for her marm. She helps about
the house. My wife couldn't get
along without Sally. The next one
is Joseph. He's named for me; and
I don't want to give up the child
that's named for myself, sir. Then
John, he's got the rickets, and is used
to be fed and taken care of. You
couldn't expect a man to send away
a child that's got the rickets, and let
him drop all his food before he gets
it to his mouth. Then Betsey, she's
named for my mother. How am I
going to send away the child that's
named for my own mother, when
she's dead and gone, and let her live
among strangers? Jane, she's homesick;
she cries if she is out of her
marm's sight a minute. She'd cry
herself to death if she was to be carried
off. Then there's Jackson, named
for General Jackson. You don't
suppose I could give away a child
that's named for General Jackson!
And George Washington, named for
the father of his country. Why, I
could do without any of 'em sooner
than I could without George Washington.
And Paul, he's named for
the 'postle Paul. It would be a sin
and a shame to give away a boy
that's named for the 'postle Paul.
And Polly, she's the baby. You
can't give a baby away from its own
mother."</p>

<p>There had been several other children
who had died, chiefly from unwholesome
little fevers, to which they
seemed addicted.</p>

<p>Carl was unable to assist the man
in his choice; but he comforted him
somewhat by promising to visit his
family soon, and left him weeping,
and gazing through the door at his
children.</p>

<p>That same afternoon Carl and Melicent
went out to visit Joe Patten's
family. It had occurred to the
young woman that she might be able
to train one of the pauper's boys for
a house-servant, and thus benefit
them and her own family at the same
time.</p>

<p>The Pattens lived directly back of
the Yorkes' place, about half a mile
farther into the woods, and their
house had no communication with
the public ways save by a cart-road.
Joe's sole income was derived from
the sale of little snags of wood that
he hauled into the village, and exchanged
for groceries. In Seaton
wood was a drug in the market. A
man must cut his beech and maple
into clear split logs, and season it
well, if he expected to get two dollars
a cord for it.</p>

<p>The walk through the woods was
a pleasant one, for nature was stirring
all alive about them. This nature
was no Delilah of the tropics,
and to one who loved a bold and
gorgeous beauty it was poor. But
for those who like to seek beauty in
her shyer, hidden ways, it had a delicate
and subtle charm. The profuse
snowy bloom of wild-cherries
showed in a cloud here and there
against the red or salmon-colored
flowers of maples and oaks. Silver
birches glimmered through their shining
foliage, like subsiding nymphs,
and the tassels of the larch swung
out their brown and gold. Violets
blue and white opened thickly in wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
places, sisterhoods of snowdrops
stood with their drooping heads tenderly
streaked with pink, little knubbles
of land were covered thickly
with old and young checkerberry&mdash;"ivry-leaves"
the children called
them, drops of gum oozed through
the rough bark of spruce and hemlock,
brooks rushed frothing past, and
birds were returning to their nests
or building new ones.</p>

<p>Soon they heard sounds of human
life through the forest quiet, the loud
voice of a scolding woman and a confused
babel of children's voices.</p>

<p>Carl smiled mockingly. "A troop
of dryads, probably," he remarked.</p>

<p>Suddenly they came out close to a
small log-house that stood in an irregular
clearing; and now the scolding
and the babel were plain to be heard.</p>

<p>"I'll lick you like a sack if you
don't bring some dry sticks to get
supper with!" cried a woman's voice,
and at the same instant a ragged
little boy bounded from the door,
helped, apparently, by some outward
application, and ran for the woods, his
bare feet seeming insensible to sticks
and stones. Then, all at once, there
was silence, and clusters of two-colored
heads in the windows, and peeping
from the door. The visitors had
been discovered. As they approached
the door, a large, wild-eyed Boadicea
came to meet them, and invited
them in with great ceremony
and politeness. She had an unwholesome,
putty-colored skin and black
hair and eyes. In one corner sat
Joe, with the baby in his arms, and
his hat on his head. This he removed,
half-rose, and performed a
salution which was more a courtesy
than a bow. But he uttered not a
word. "In this house clearly,</p>

<p class="center">
'<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame d'Acier est le père</span>,'"<br />
</p>

<p>thought Carl.</p>

<p>With a sweep of the arm she banished
the children all into one corner
of the room (the house contained
but one room), brought two strip-bottomed
chairs, from one of which
her husband had meekly fled at her
approach, and, dusting them off with
her apron, invited her visitors to be
seated.</p>

<p>"You must excuse the confusion
reigning in my poor mansion," she
said with great suavity, and a very
good accent. "Children are always
disorderly. Sarah!" raising her
voice, "bring the besom and sweep
up the embers."</p>

<p>Melicent turned a look of dismay
on her brother, who was taken with
a slight cough. Sarah, otherwise
Sally, came bashfully out from behind
her father, where she had been
crouching on the floor, and swept up
the hearth with a brush broom.</p>

<p>The poor woman, anxious to do
all honor to her visitors, and, also,
to show them that she was above her
circumstances, knew no other way
than by using the largest words she
could think of. Her idea of polite
conversation was to make it as little
as possible like anything she was accustomed
to.</p>

<p>Melicent stated her errand at once,
and the mother, with many thanks,
and lamentations on her misfortunes,
called the little ones forward, and
placed them at the lady's disposal.
She stopped in her compliments to dart
a threatening look toward the door,
where the boy who had been "named
for the 'postle Paul" stood with
his burden of dry sticks. He dropped
them instantly, and came forward,
and his mother as instantly resumed
her smiling face. She could change
her expression with remarkable facility.</p>

<p>Melicent fancied this boy at once,
and promptly concluded a bargain to
give a week's trial to him and his
eldest sister. They were to go to "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
hall," as Mrs. Patten politely called
it, the next day, and begin their
training. They would work for their
food and clothing, and perhaps, after
a while, when she should think them
worthy, they might receive wages.</p>

<p>This settled, Miss Yorke and her
brother departed, followed by Mrs.
Patten's compliments to the door,
and stared after by all the children.
Joe's only movement on their going
was to perform another courtesy like
that with which he had received
them.</p>

<p>"Poor souls! they are delighted
to have their children with us," said
Melicent, when they were out of
hearing. "But I hope the mother
won't come to see them often. Betsey
says she is half-crazy."</p>

<p>"I respect her for it!" Carl exclaimed.
"You can see that she has
some talent and ambition, and that
she has read some, though she is absurdly
ignorant of the ways of the
world. With such a husband, such
a troop of children, and such poverty,
I repeat I respect her for being
crazy. She can't have a person to
speak to but her own family, immured
in those forest solitudes, as she
says."</p>

<p>Mrs. Patten looked after them as
long as she could see them, her face
glowing with pride. Then she went
into her house, went to the fireplace,
and withdrew a pair of iron tongs
that lay with red-hot tips in the coals
there. "There is no need of them
now," she said exultingly.</p>

<p>These tongs had been kept red
during the last week for the better
reception of any town officer who
should venture to come for one of
her children. Mrs. Patten did not
by any means propose to submit
tamely. Then she turned tragically,
and faced her husband with a look
of withering contempt.</p>

<p>"I was meant to be such a lady
as that!" she exclaimed, with a grand
gesture of the arm in the direction
where Melicent Yorke had disappeared.
"And yet, I sacrificed my
birthright&mdash;fool that I was!&mdash;to
marry you, Joe Patten!"</p>

<p>Joe shrank, and hugged the baby
up to him. "I know you did, Sally!"
he said deprecatingly&mdash;"I
know you did!"</p>

<p>"And you never knew enough to
appreciate me!" she continued in a
tragic tone.</p>

<p>"I know I never did," answered
Joe in a trembling voice&mdash;"I know
it, Sally."</p>

<p>"Learn to respect me, then!" she
said, drawing herself up. "Call me
Mrs. Patten!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, I do, I have," whimpered
Joe. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue!" commanded
his wife. "Paul, bring me those
chips." And she proceeded to get
supper.</p>

<p>Poor Sally Patten was not nearly
so cruel as she appeared. In truth,
she had never laid the weight of her
hand upon her husband. But, then,
he was always afraid she would.</p>

<h2>MEXICAN ART AND ITS MICHAEL ANGELO.</h2>


<p>The society of Mexico has become
a ruin in which it is necessary to
search with some labor to discover
monuments of literature and art.
Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz, though
for her time an extraordinary woman,
is unknown to the greater portion of
the continent of whose letters she
seems to have been the true morning
star. Of Siguenza, mathematician,
philosopher, historian, antiquary, and
of Velasquez Cardenas, the astronomer
and geometrician, the world knew
little until Humboldt praised their
remarkable talents. Not without a
shrug of surprise, we imagine, did the
readers of half a century ago accept
his assurance that "M. Tolsa, professor
of sculpture at Mexico, was
even able to cast an equestrian statue
of King Charles the Fourth; a work
which, with the exception of the Marcus
Aurelius at Rome, surpasses in
beauty and purity of style everything
which remains in this way in Europe."
Miguel Cabrera, a greater
artist than Tolsa, and the most vigorous
imaginative genius which Mexico
has produced, has yet to be adequately
recognized in America. The
art of our northern republic boasts
the names of Trumbull, Stuart, Allston,
Inman, Vanderlyn, Sully, Neagle,
Hamilton, Rothermel, Church,
Crawford, Powers, Akers, Greenough,
Hosmer, and others; but we doubt
if among all these can be found an
artist as praiseworthy as was this
Mexican Cabrera. Do we exaggerate?
No; we are addressing a
practical public, much in love with
its own works and ways and ideals,
and not too well disposed to imagine
the difficulties of a Mexican artist
one hundred and thirty years ago.</p>

<p>But, first, let us describe, so far as
we may, the scene and circumstances
of his artistic labors. Mexico, as
compared with our northern cities,
is a wonderfully old-fashioned capital.
The walls of its houses have
been built to last till doomsday, and
its doors are like doors of castles.
Many of its flat fronts boast stuccoed
ornaments: all are painted with tints
ranging from yellow to pink and
pale blue&mdash;colors of art which, as
applied in particular cases, are seldom
at once tolerable to a foreign
eye, but which find their reason in
necessity as well as taste, and partly
in the dull, unlovely character of the
building material. This is often a
kind of lava-stone or tezontle, a stone
the volcano itself seems to have supplied
for the purpose of resisting
earthquake, and which defies the insidious
action of Mexican damps.
The churches are instances of colored
architecture. La Profesa is yellowed;
the cathedral's chapel is browned.
San Domingo, San Agustin, and, in
fact, all the Mexican churches are
tinted more or less, the favorite hue
being a mild and not offensive yellow,
qualified by white plasters. One remembers
gratefully that neutral tint
which makes a long range of Mexican
houses, with their balconies and
tasteful awnings, quaint and elegant
letterings of signs, and flags hung out
at shop-doors, so picturesque, so
pleasant, and so characteristic. The
perspective of a Mexican street, especially
toward the close of the day,
enjoys a repose of many colors well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
blended with such lines of substantial
houses as cannot but impress the eye
of the musing stranger. Their architecture,
so simple and massive, but
so different from a certain wide-awake
familiarity which is written upon the
houses of the North, best assimilates
in his view with some mood of twilight.
Yet, seen at dawn or at dusk,
or under the moon, the city of Mexico
never loses its one decided charm of
picturesqueness. It was this exceeding
quality which doubtless delighted
the eye of Humboldt when he praised
Mexico as one of the finest of cities.
He had, perhaps, beheld from its
cathedral's steeple a most unique capital&mdash;a
city set not on a hill, but in
one of the dreamiest of valleys near
one of the dreamiest and shallowest
of lakes, with Popocatapetl and Ixtaccihuatl,
snow-crowned and heaven-seeking,
for monuments of its
guardian valley.</p>

<p>In such a scene, Cabrera and his
contemporary artists did their work.
Their school was the church. What
this church was in their day the
splendid traditions of art found
even now in its corridors and near
its altars bear faithful witnesses.
Something from their hands has
gone into every community of Mexico,
and, if war has spared one-half
the relics of her art as it existed one
hundred and fifty or two hundred
years ago, the republic is still fortunate
in one respect. The cathedrals
of Puebla and Mexico, and La
Profesa, were perhaps the chief homes
of that genius of painting which
was manifested not merely in one,
but in a number of Mexicans. Who
are the artists of the exceedingly fine
pictures which may be seen in the
church at Puebla the stranger rarely
ascertains. The tradition that Velasquez,
the great pupil of Murillo,
and Cabrera, the native Mexican,
sowed the religion of the New World
with their pencils some centuries ago,
supplies him with the morsel of
vague knowledge with which he reluctantly
leaves a building full of rich
and curious shrines. Mexico is to
all appearances singularly deficient
in a proper memory of her noblest
painters. Go into one of the city's
oldest churches, and your friendly
guide, though he be a priest, may not
be able to tell you who painted the
saints on the walls and the heads of
the apostles on the shrines. The information
possessed outside of the
church respecting its treasures of art
has, under stress of various revolutions,
dissipated into vague generalities.
Three or four remarkable names
are known, and a few famous pictures;
but who can at once point out
to us the masterpieces of any of the
five or six painters whose works are
worth remembering, or tell us near
what shrines, outside of the capital
itself, we are likely to find rare pictures?
Nevertheless, art is almost
the chief boast of Mexico, aside from
its natural endowments, though, like
so much else in a land subject to all
manner of vicissitudes, the boast is
to some extent shadowy and unsubstantial.
In successive revolutions,
it is conjectured, those true
homes of fine art, the convents, have
been despoiled, and the saints and
angels of their galleries sent hither
and thither, to be kept by natives or
to be sold to foreigners as Joseph
was sold by his brethren. Another
spoliation, and perhaps a searching
and sweeping one, is said to have
taken place under the eye of the
French during their mercenary intervention.
How or by whom robbed
and mutilated in the last half-century
of wars, Mexican art is but the wreck
of what it was. That so much of it
still survives is a proof of its original
abundance and vitality.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the whirlwinds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
of revolution, art in the
country of Cabrera has retained a
number of impregnable and indestructible
asylums. Altar ornaments
of gold or silver may have been stolen
from the cathedral, but apparently
no sacrilegious criminal has ever
carried away its pictures. These
treasures of the church are set fast in
their places round the shrines, so
closely and plentifully that, wherever
they are most congregated, the
altar-places seem walled and tiled
with them. Not all of them are
worthy of Cabrera or Xuarez or Ximenez,
let alone Murillo and Velasquez;
but all have their value as
portions of a chapter in art the like
of which is not to be seen elsewhere
on the American continent. Confused
and perplexed as the real beauties
of many of these paintings are by
the endless bedizenments of altars, it
is impossible to ignore or conceal
the richness, delicacy, and even tenderness
which belong to their best
specimens. The extravagance of
gilding, the wilderness of carved
flourishes, which the taste of the sixteenth
century placed at the back
of the altars, do not form the best
repository for the subdued beauty
which a noble picture acquires with
age. The great back altar-wall of
the cathedral is from floor to roof
one mass of most ingenious carving
and gilding, out of which what seem
to be pious aborigines, associated
with warriors and saints on the same
background, blossom in paint and
gold. Our modern and practical
tastes do not easily give room to an
ornamentation as loud and prodigal
as figures in this great recess; but
it is nevertheless a rare and meritorious
work in its way. Other shrines
display the same gilding in an inferior
degree; and we must divest ourselves
of some prejudice, artistic and
otherwise, before we appreciate the
merit of extreme elaboration in their
ornaments, and discover, notwithstanding
this lavish wealth of surrounding
decoration, the modest
worth of the best pictures of the
church.</p>

<p>The cathedral is well constituted
to be the ark and refuge of religious
art. It is about 428 feet long and
200 wide, while its general height is
almost 100, that of its towers being
nearly 200 feet. These dimensions
argue an interior vast enough to enclose
three or four such churches as
we may see on Broadway, without
taking into account its large adjoining
chapel. Its exterior is a congregation
of heavy masses crowned by
great bell-shaped towers, but wanting
a grand unity and exaltation. Nevertheless,
the charm of picturesqueness
which belongs to so many solid monuments
of the sixteenth century has
rested upon this cathedral, in spite of
its dinginess and heaviness; and a
view of it under the magic of a moonlight
which Italian skies could not
more than rival is one of the finest
of a series of Mexican lithographs.
Gothic height, space, and freedom are
the prime qualities of the cathedral's
interior. Not less than twenty-two
shrines are there visible in an extent
of two aisles and twenty arches,
the columns of which are each quintupled.
The high porphyry columns,
the range of the apostles, the burst of
gilded glory, and the outspread angels
over the principal altar are exceedingly
impressive, notwithstanding
an exuberance of colors. The choir,
altogether the best architectural feature
of the great building, rises rather
toward the middle of the church, and
up from the floor, in a high and luxurious
growth of oaken carvings and
embellishments. Inside is the assembly
of the saints, finely panelled.
Cherub and seraph are busy apparently
with the superb organ-pipes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
and make merry overhead with all
the instruments of an orchestra, while
impish faces beneath them seem to
be out of temper. The nobleness of
the choir as a work of art is, in great
part, due to its gravity, though it is
as ingenious, perhaps, as anything of
the kind need be, without seeking
comparison with the mightiest fancies
of the Old World.</p>

<p>Even to an ordinary observer it is
plain that the old cathedral is well
endowed with pictures. The pure
olive-faced Madonna, over the nearest
and most popular altar, is said to
be Murillo's; it may be Velasquez's.
She is a mild, meek lady, with a boy
in her lap, veritably human in feature.
Out of the rich shade of a great old
artist's mood cherubs seem to swarm
upon them. In the fine gloom of
Vespers, when only the face of
the Madonna is seen, the religious
mildness of this picture is especially
venerable. Other altars have
many curiosities, more or less associated
with art. There is at one a
Man of Sorrow, sitting and leaning
in wretched plight; at another, a sallow
and agonized Redeemer on the
cross; and painted statues and crucifixes
only less realistic and distressful
than these are common throughout
the church. The ghostly figure
of what may be a dead saint is laid
out in wax, as upon a bed, at one
shrine, and elsewhere what seems to
be a dead Redeemer is altared in a
glass case. In the chapel the artistic
character of the cathedral is repeated,
save that its high altar-columns, its
cross-bearing angel, its splendidly-rayed
apotheosis of the Blessed Virgin, its
statues of Moses and John the Baptist,
have a more modern workmanship.
The Madonna, in lady-like wax, with
a crown upon her head, and holding
daintily a babe in her arms, is the
principal figure of one of the auxiliary
shrines, though not the best specimen
of an art in which Mexicans
excel, and which, as represented in a
black-robed figure of the Mother of
Sorrows, is sometimes admirable and
religiously effective. These instances,
though but a few of the numberless
curiosities of wood and wax
amid which the painters have found
their abiding home, will serve to illustrate
the very mixed artistic complexion
of the Mexican cathedral. The
statues and paintings are of all sorts,
colors, and styles. But the shadowy
picture of a sad, nunlike face of Our
Lady of Sorrows; the quaint-hooded
countenance of the Blessed Virgin,
apparently wrought in tapestry of the
middle ages; or that of our Lord,
after he had been scourged, plainly
apprise us that the sincerity of art,
first consecrated by the church, has
become a part of its own consecration.
These are sacred pictures, truly.
Weary and wretched, his head bound
with thorns, our Lord leans in agonized
contemplation, while an apostle
looks up to him in tears. The elements
of this exquisite painting are
gloom and pathos developed out of
Murillo-like colors and shadows.
Another painting, equally reverend,
pursues the same theme and mood.
To whose genius do we owe them?
Perhaps to Velasquez, of whose
works the church, it is said, possesses
a noble number; perhaps to Cabrera.
Who shall decide? One of the
fathers or cathedraticos might tell us,
but which father and which professor?
The condition of topsy-turvy
succeeding a revolution is not favorable
to the pursuit or the memory of
art; and, as we have hinted, the proper
rediscovery of Mexican art must
be a matter of unselfish and laborious
search. Mexico does not, perhaps,
even yet know its proper historian.</p>

<p>Yet some thing we do know of
Cabrera. The fine head of St. Peter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
pointed out to the writer by a padre
of San Hypolito, is by him. One of
three immense canvases in the sacristy
of the cathedral is also his
surprising handiwork. It is a pictorial
homage to the Pope, wherein the
successor of St. Peter, gray and
grave, sits on the topmost seat of
a ponderous car of triumph, which is
pushed by giants of the faith led by
heroes and saints. What seems to
be the genius of history has a seat in
the van, and disporting cherubs hover
on flank and rear, while the aged
Pope is being ministered to or counselled
by a saint or apostle. This
picture, perhaps the largest, though
not necessarily the best, painted by
Cabrera, is very remarkable for its
vigor and variety of form. The other
great canvases are by Xuarez and
Ximenez, both Mexican painters of
genius. One represents the victory
of Michael celebrated by the angelic
powers; the theme of the other
appears to be the reception of the
Holy Lady in heaven. Pictures of
this extensive character are certainly
calculated to display the energy of
artists, but not always to develop the
highest expression of religion. There
can be no question of the vigor of
these paintings, especially of Cabrera's;
but probably we shall have to
seek among smaller canvases and
less complicated subjects the true
masterpieces of Cabrera, Xuarez, and
Ximenez. Some years ago they
might have been found in the Convent
of La Profesa or of St. Dominic,
or, perhaps, in the Academy of
San Carlos; but where are they now?
That academy, once, doubtless, the
finest of its kind in America, and
still among the best, does contain, it
is true, some master paintings by
Xuarez, Rodriguez, Joachim, Ludovicus,
bearing date after the close of
the sixteenth century; but these do
not give us assurance of being the
best examples of what was done
about Cabrera's time. The walls of
San Carlos, we may remark in passing,
contain a very large, melodramatic
descent from the cross by Baltasar
de Chaue, and a beautiful Shepherd
Boy, by Ingies, whose simplicity
recalls the fact that the Lute
Player, one of the few genuine Murillos
said to be in the country, is in
the possession of a Mexican club.</p>

<p>But what of Cabrera? Alas! that
the walls of San Carlos should tell
us little or nothing; that the padre
who guides us through La Profesa
knows about as much! The poor
muse of painting has been a good-for-nothing
these many years, a
wretched Cinderella sitting at a ruined
hearthstone, or, rather, sweeping
up the rubbish in the corridors of
confiscated and despoiled convents.
La Profesa, however, is an asylum
of art. As it now stands, it is a fine
old church, whose rigid and antiquated
countenance many a praying
Mexican woman knows for that of a
mother. Nothing of its ample, simple,
sturdy architecture has crumbled
in the last two centuries. Its plateresco&mdash;the
"frolic fancy" which sixteenth-century
art put upon the front
of churches, and of which the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">façade</i>
of the cathedral presents an immense
example, entangling cherubs and bewildering
saints in the ingenuity of
its small sculptures&mdash;still remains intact.
The apostles are in their niches,
and "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Nuestro Señor</span>" is invoked
in a text cut on the outside walls.
Not many years ago, La Profesa was
not merely a church, but, as its name
indicates, a house for religious women,
and that, too, one of the richest
and most extensive in Mexico.
Many courts, many corridors and
fountains, and some pleasant gardens,
with eaves-haunting birds to remind
one of St. Francis's gossips, the sparrows,
were no doubt among the possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of this convent as of other
convents in the capital, from whose
now deserted walks and cells one
may hear the flow of fountains and
the song of birds. But a few corridors
of the many that belonged to
the house have been left to the church
out of a general ruin made necessary
for the cutting of a wide street
through what was once a vast building
or number of buildings. These
corridors and the church itself were
in 1868 visited by the writer in company
with a courteous young padre,
but he could learn comparatively little
of the unmistakable riches of art
deposited there. Who painted the
superb heads of the apostles framed
in an altar near the sacristy? Cabrera
or Velasquez? The padre did
not know. As we entered the first
of the wide, heavy stone corridors,
two old men, looking like pensioners,
were saying their prayers aloud before
a shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe.
We stood opposite a mammoth
scene of the crucifixion, wherein
Christ and the thieves are most
painfully individualized on the gloom
of Calvary. Age and neglect had
seemingly eclipsed the larger portion
of this canvas, and left no shade of
the painter's identity in the mind of
our student of the cloister. In another
ill-lighted corridor were paintings
by Cabrera, Xuarez, Ximenez,
Joachim, Correa, Rodriguez, and
some others, all Mexicans, it is said,
and evidently men of decided gifts.
Here was a picture by Xuarez of the
Saviour in apparition among the
apostles&mdash;a presentment in tenderest
and most luminous colors of ethereal
gentleness. The finest picture in the
gallery, entitled St. Luke, might have
been by a pupil of Murillo, but really
the padre could not tell. Another
corridor more neglected than the
rest seemed to be a very charnel-room
for art&mdash;a place for the rags
and lumber of unhung, undusted,
unrestored pictures. The distracted
church has been a sorry sexton for
its dead painters. After all, the best
efforts are not certain of immunity
from the outrages of time and ignorance.
Well enough if the great unseen
critic applauds.</p>

<p>Nowadays the common visitor to
La Profesa searches not at all for
Cabrera, but looks at a dome brilliantly
painted with scenes from the
life of the Saviour by the Spanish
Mexican Clavel. Except the dome
of Santa Teresa's by Cordero, there
is perhaps nothing of the kind, at
least in the three principal cities of
Mexico, to compare with Clavel's
work. Cordero, whose picture of
Columbus at court received all the
honors of an exhibition in the palace
of Prince Poniatowski at Florence,
and who has received high encomiums
from his brother artists in Italy,
is by some regarded the best of existing
Mexican artists. Like the two
Coras, who, with Tolsa, appear to be
the most noted of the sculptors of
Mexico, Cordero is a native of the
country. To Jose Villegas Coras,
who was born in 1713, the city of
Puebla owes those statues of our
Lord and Our Lady, which one of
his admirers declares have a sublimity
of expression and a grace in details
not easy to find in the best
schools of Europe. Jose Zocarias
Coras, his nephew, was less an idealist,
says his critic, but more faithful
to nature, and is distinguished by
his sculptures of the "Crucified," in
which are exhibited a profound agony.
The two statues which crown
the towers of the cathedral are also
the work of the younger Coras, who
died in 1819, in the sixty-seventh
year of his age. The work of these
men was ill-requited, like so much
else in Mexican life and industry.
The writer is not able to speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
them upon personal or from a very
common knowledge of their sculptures;
but it is well to note them
here as artists who are thought worthy
of a place in that scarce and not
too steady literature, Mexican biography.
It may serve others who
visit Mexico to know that, in the latest
phase of art at the capital, Clavel,
Rebull, Cordero, and the sculptor
Islas, with some others, have distinguished
themselves.</p>

<p>Let us now speak freely of Cabrera,
the father and master of Mexican
art&mdash;of him whose pictures are at
once so numerous and so scarce,
whose fame is so well-founded, yet
of whose life so little is known. The
first important fact in his biography
is, that, like the greatest ruler which
the country has produced, its greatest
artist was an Indian&mdash;a Zapotec
Indian, too, from the native country
of Benito Juarez, Oaxoca. The next
is that, under the patronage of the
Archbishop Salinas, he painted those
many admirable pieces which are the
reproachful glory of his country.
According to a modern Mexican
writer, Señor Orozco, works of Cabrera
may be found in the churches
of Mexico and Puebla especially,
and in the convents of San Domingo
and La Profesa, but we have seen
under what circumstances. His masterpieces,
if we may credit the intelligent
opinion reported by Señor
Orozco, are contained in the sacristy
of the church at Tasco, where a
whole life of the Blessed Virgin is
portrayed, the scene of the Nativity
being distinguished by its light and
freshness of color. The same writer
assures us that Cabrera wrote a treatise
on the celebrated picture given
to the Indian Juan Diego during the
Marvellous Apparition of Our Lady
of Guadalupe, and in it he concurs
with other painters of his day in affirming
that the miraculous painting,
which he had examined carefully in
the light of art, is not the work of
human hands. This is the judgment
of an Indian artist respecting a wonderful
revelation made to one of his
race, and, however it may be viewed
by those who discredit all supernaturalism
of a later date than eighteen
hundred years ago, gives the
stamp of conviction to the faith of
Guadalupe. What the opinion of
Cabrera was worth in a question of
art, what the artist himself should
be worth in the estimation of mankind,
is signified to us in the following
extraordinary notice of his genius
by Count Beltrani, an Italian
traveller:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Some pictures of Cabrera are called
<i>American wonders</i>, and all are of eminent
merit. The life of St. Dominic, painted
by him in the cloister of the convent of
that name; the life of St. Ignatius, and
the history of the man degraded by mortal
sin and regenerated by religion and
virtue, in the cloister of La Profesa, present
two galleries which in nothing yield
to the cloister of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santa Maria la Nueva
di Florencia</span>, and the Campo Santo of
Pisa. I hazard even saying that Cabrera
alone, in these two cloisters, is worth all
the artists joined who have painted the
two magnificent Italian galleries. Cabrera
possesses the outlines of Correggio, the
animation of Domenichino, and the pathos
of Murillo. His episodes&mdash;as the 'Angels,'
etc.&mdash;are of rare beauty. In my conception,
he is a great painter. He was,
moreover, an architect and sculptor; in
fine, the Michael Angelo of Mexico."</p></blockquote>

<p>What say our American pilgrims to
Italy of this report of an Italian pilgrim
in America? Here, then, was
an Indian Michael Angelo of whom
few artists of the New World know
anything whatever. We need not
strain an objection that Count Beltrani's
dictum may be an exaggeration,
for there are not many travellers
who care to praise Mexico, and
very few to overpraise her&mdash;at least,
in respect to art. The fact remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
that the country which gave birth to
Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz, perhaps
the most remarkable character in all
American letters, also had for its native
the greatest painter of the New
World, and one of the most singularly
meritorious in an age when great
painters were numerous. In judging
of Cabrera, we must fairly consider
the time, the place, the elements in
which he wrought; for schools, masters,
models, emulation, royal encouragement,
and proper recompense and
fame were all denied to him, in a
greater or less degree. Cloistered as
a great artist must necessarily be at
any time, he would have felt, perhaps,
especially abandoned in far-off
Mexico in the sixteenth century. That
Cabrera did suffer this abandonment
the facts of his life attest. Yet, to
speak a literal truth, Cabrera has no
biography. It is not known when he
was born or when he died, and, says
a Mexican writer, "we only know
that he lived in the eighteenth century
by the dates of his paintings."
Alas! for fame; alas! for genius!&mdash;and
this, too, in the eighteenth century!
We know more of Shakespeare,
more of Lopé, more of Sor
Juana, more of Alarcon&mdash;he, too,
was born in Mexico, yet we know
his birthday&mdash;than of Cabrera, who
could not have died more than a
hundred and twenty-five years ago,
and respecting whom it was said:
"There is hardly a church of the
republic which does not contain
some work of his distinguished pencil."
Alas! for work and worth!
How much of all this may have
perished or vanished beneath the
storms of the last fifty miserable
years of Mexican life, overridden
by swaggering pronouncers, stolen
by intervening robbers, the torch of
genius extinguished in the dust raised
by defiant nobodies. Yet Cabrera survives,
as few artists can, a veritable
wreck of matter. Happily for him,
it may be, his only biography is in
his works; and they are full of life,
and of life better than his own, yet
in some respects received into it&mdash;lives
of saints, apostles, angels, the
Blessed Virgin, and the Divine Redeemer.
Let these speak for his life
to men, and commend his work to
the unseen Master.</p>

<h2>WHAT OUR MUNICIPAL LAW OWES TO THE CHURCH.</h2>


<p>The wisdom and bravery of our
forefathers having at length enabled
them to sever the ties which had bound
the original thirteen colonies to Great
Britain, their experience, knowledge,
and foresight were called into requisition
to form a government for the
new nation, and adopt a code of
laws which, avoiding the complex
and erroneous features of those of
the Old-World countries, the necessary
result of centuries of contradictory
legislation, would confirm to
the people their newly-acquired liberties,
and guarantee to every citizen
not only justice from the state, but,
in their relations with each other, ample
protection for life and liberty, property
and reputation. As a foundation
for this new system of jurisprudence,
the statesmen of the Revolution selected
the English code almost in
its entirety, partly because the late
colonists had been familiar with its
workings on either side of the ocean,
but mainly because they considered
it, comparatively, at least, humane and
liberal, and the most suitable for a
free government. Many statutes and
customs peculiar to monarchies were
at the time necessarily omitted, and
several enactments have since been
passed by our national and local
legislatures liberalizing ancient laws,
as intended to keep pace with the
rapid development of our industrial
resources, which, from time to time,
creates new and complicated relations
between individuals. Still, to
all intents and purposes, our body of
laws is fundamentally identical with
that of England in the last century,
is founded on the same general principles,
and has the same origin and
history. Therefore, in speaking of
the jurisprudence of our republic,
we also speak of that of Great Britain,
for whatever applies to one as a
whole equally applies to the other.</p>

<p>Our municipal law, consisting of
the common law (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex non scripta</i>)
and the statute law (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lex scripta</i>),
springs from three distinct sources,
each of which in its degree has materially
contributed its share to the
general stock which goes to make
up our legal system, which, for completeness
and enlightenment of spirit,
may well challenge the admiration
of mankind. These three sources
are&mdash;the ancient common law of
England, the civil law of the Roman
Empire, and the canon law of the
church. Though originating at distinct
periods and places, and intended
primarily to operate on diverse
elements, the provisions of these
three codes have in process of time
become so interwoven, one with the
other, in the body of the English
law, that it is often difficult and
sometimes impossible to discriminate
between them.</p>

<p>The common law, in its general
acceptation, is composed of the ancient
customs of England, beyond
which the memory of man runneth
not to the contrary, of reports of
cases and decisions of judges thereon,
and of the writings of persons learned
in the law. Sir William Blackstone,
the celebrated author of the <cite>Commentaries
on the Laws of England</cite>, is
by universal consent the greatest
expounder of the common law. With
the legal profession, his opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
have a force little less binding than
that of a positive enactment, while
his definitions, whether borrowed
from his predecessors or his own
creation, are accepted by the learned
of all classes as the most comprehensive
and satisfactory in the language
on this branch of study. Unhappily
for posterity, but more unfortunately
for his own reputation,
Blackstone lived and wrote in an age
when it was the fashion to introduce
into every department of English literature
the most absurd calumnies
against the church, and to advance
the most preposterous claims in favor
of the so-called Reformation. The
wild fanaticism and lust of plunder
with which that stupendous rebellion
against God's authority was inaugurated
had in a great measure subsided
in the middle of the last century,
and it behooved those of its
advocates who attempted to look
back into the past to justify present
crimes by maligning their Catholic
ancestors, or, when that could not
be hazarded, by imputing the
worst of motives for the best of actions.
The great commentator, with
all his perspicacity and legal acumen,
was nor above resorting to this dishonest
method of bolstering a sinking
cause, and hence we find in his
otherwise invaluable work that he
loses no opportunity, in or out of
season, to ignore the transcendent
merits, misrepresent the conduct, and
misconstrue the intentions of the ecclesiastics
of the early and middle
ages of the church, who, in their
time, had done so much to reduce
our laws into something like system,
and make them conform in justice
and equity as much as possible to
those revealed by the Creator. Surrounded
by the mists of doubt and
dissent, the emanation of a hundred
jarring creeds, he failed to see beyond
the horizon of his own generation,
or to perceive the reflux of
that wave of heresy which, in the
sixteenth century, submerged England,
and threatened to inundate the
whole of Europe. As an expounder
of law, Blackstone still holds a position
in the front rank of our jurists,
but so warped are his views by the
prejudices of the epoch in which he
lived that, before the enlightened
spirit of our time, he is gradually but
surely losing his vantage-ground as
an impartial authority, even on questions
upon which he is really most
reliable. Another defect in the
writings of this able professor, but
one of much lesser importance, is
his constant tendency to exaggerate
the merits of the Anglo-Saxon lawgivers,
and to attribute to them the
credit of originating many laws
which were wholly unknown in England
till many years after the conquest;
but as we have the authority
of Hallam for saying that his knowledge
of ancient history was rather
superficial, we may attribute this
fault more to a deficiency of historical
knowledge than to a wilful intention
to deceive.</p>

<p>The civil law is founded principally
on the ancient regal constitutions of
Rome, on the laws of the twelve
tables, the statutes of the senate and
republic, the edicts of the prætors, the
opinions of learned lawyers, and on
imperial decrees. So numerous, however,
had these various enactments
become, and so contradictory in
terms and penalties, that the study
of them was the labor of a
lifetime, altogether beyond the
ability of the great mass of the
governed to overcome. It was
therefore found necessary in the reign
of Theodosius, about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 438, to
codify them, and, by rejecting all superfluous
matter, to greatly reduce
their bulk. About a century later,
under the Emperor Justinian, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
were again submitted to a similar
process, the Institutes being reduced
to four books, and the Pandects,
containing over two thousand cases
and opinions, to fifty. To these
were added a new code, being a continuation
of that of Theodosius, the
novels or decrees of that emperor
and his successors, as well as those
of Justinian himself. These taken
together formed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus juris civilis</i>
of the Eastern and Western Empires.
It is in the new code and the novels
that we first begin to perceive the influence
of the church in civil legislation.
From the time of the conversion
of Constantine, the emperors,
with one or two exceptions, were the
fast friends, and, in matters spiritual,
the obedient children of the pontiffs.
The laws of pagan times, particularly
those respecting distributive justice
and the domestic relations, were
utterly unsuited for the government
of a Christian people, and, as the
church was recognized as the sole
arbiter of right and wrong in the abstract,
it is natural to expect that the
Christian emperors before and after
Justinian not only conformed to the
dicta of the church in their decrees
and decisions, but frequently consulted
their spiritual advisers on matters
affecting conscience in their twofold
capacity of legislators and judges.
Justinian in particular appears to
have borrowed many of his ideas of
temporal law from the church, for we
find him paraphrasing or adopting
bodily many of the canons of the
early councils.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Hence we easily
perceive that much of the more modern
portion of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus juris civilis</i>,
though bearing the impress of imperial
authority, is in reality little
more than a copy of the rules laid
down previously for the spiritual and
social guidance of the children of the
church, and that those grand principles
and delicate distinctions which
are as true to-day as in the time of
the apostles, and are as applicable to
our advanced state of civilization as
they were then, are simply the
result of the infusion of the spirit of
Christianity into the civil polity of a
once pagan people. Thus we find
the Institutes or Elements of Justinian
commencing with the solemn invocation,
"In the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ," and ending with the
equally edifying aspiration, "Blessed
be the majesty of God and our Lord
Jesus Christ," and in harmony with
this pious disposition we find among
other laws relating to the rights of
the church the following: "Those
things which have been consecrated
by the pontiffs in due form are esteemed
sacred; such as churches,
chapels, and all movable things, if
they have been properly dedicated
to the service of God, and we have forbidden
by our constitution that these
things should be either aliened or obligated
unless for the redemption of
captives."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> A novel of Valentinian,
in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 452, in recognizing the right
of bishops to try cases of only temporal
concern where the parties were
in orders, extends their jurisdiction
over laics who have power to "oblige
themselves to obey the sentence of
the bishop," which sentence, if necessary,
was to be enforced by the
civil authorities.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The church did not conform, either
in her discipline or her doctrine, to
the rules or underlying principles of
the civil law, but on the contrary
subjected that law to the most rigid
examination and the most careful
analysis, expurgating what was opposed
to justice and retaining all that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>she found in consonance with divine
truth; and as the Roman civil law
was at that period a rule for all civilized
nations, this may be considered
her first great human gift to mankind,
equal if not superior to her subsequent
culture of the arts, sciences, and
literature. Admitting, then, the harmony
which existed between the
Roman laws and the teachings of
the church, we are not surprised to
find that when, in the eleventh century,
a copy of Justinian, discovered
at Amalphi, Italy, was published, it
was eagerly received by European
nations, adopted in whole or in
part by all Christendom, and that it
to-day forms the main foundation of
the jurisprudence of all enlightened
peoples.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>About the time of the revival of
the study of the Roman civil law,
Gratian, an Italian monk, published
in three volumes, arranged in titles
and chapters after the manner of
the Pandects, a collection of the decrees
of the general councils of the
church, a digest of the opinions of
the fathers, and the decretals and
bulls of the Holy See. Other collections
had been previously made by
ecclesiastics in Spain and elsewhere,
but none were found to be complete
or reliable. However, as Gratian's
work was itself far from perfect, Pope
Gregory IX. authorized Raymond
de Pennafort, a learned divine, to
compile a new collection, which was
published by authority of his Holiness,
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1234, under the title of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Decretalia Gregorii Noni</i>. It was divided
into five books, and contained
all that was worth preserving of
Gratian, with the subsequent rescripts
of the Popes, especially those of
Alexander III., Innocent III., Honorius
III., and Gregory IX. "In
these books," says Hallam, "we find
a regular and copious system of jurisprudence,
derived in a great measure
from the civil law, but with
considerable deviation and possible
improvement."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Boniface VIII.,
sixty years afterwards, published a
sixth part, known as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sextus Decretalium</i>,
divided also into five books, in
the nature of a supplement to the
other five, of which it follows the
arrangement, and is composed of
decisions promulgated after the pontificate
of Gregory IX. New constitutions
were added by Clement V.
and John XXII., under the titles
respectively of <cite>Clementine</cite> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Extravagantes
Johannis</i>, and a few rescripts
of later pontiffs are included
in a second supplement, arranged
like the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sextus</i>, and called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Extravantes
Communes</i>. Up to the Council
of Pisa, in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1409, these books
constituted the whole of the canon
law or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">corpus juris canonici</i>, and
though principally intended for the
government of ecclesiastics, were
often applied to temporal purposes,
in law and equity, when neither the
civil nor common law met the requirements
of a disputed point. The
study of the canons had been encouraged
from the first in the colleges
and schools of Europe, but,
upon the publication in a systematical
form in the eleventh century, it
became universal, and with the
Roman civil law constituted an essential
branch of clerical education.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>At first the Canonists and Glossators,
as the professors of civil law were
called, formed separate but not antagonistic
schools, but in the thirteenth
century Lanfrancus, a professor
of Bologna, united the study of both
laws, a custom which has since been
generally adopted.</p>

<p>As we have before remarked, Sir
William Blackstone would fain have
us believe that every principle of
English common law originated with,
and was recognized by, the Anglo-Saxons
from the remotest period of
their history, but there is neither fact
nor probable suspicion to sustain
those unqualified statements of our
partial commentator. The Romans,
who held possession of Britain for
more than four hundred years, may
have left on the vanquished people
of that country some impress of their
laws, but the Britons themselves,
soon after the departure of the
legions, were driven to the mountains
of Wales by the Angles and
Saxons, and for centuries held no intercourse
with the victorious intruders.
These latter, the outpourings of
the woods and swamps of the north,
are represented by all reliable historians
as the veriest barbarians, illiterate
and idolatrous, and altogether
incapable of conceiving or appreciating
the broad principles of free government
or the varied regulations
which control the intercourse and
commerce of man with man, such as
we find in civilized society; much
less those which affect the conduct
of household relations, which, originating
in the church, could only have
been properly expounded by her
ministers. The Danes, who subsequently
invaded and for many years
held possession of the larger portion
of the island, were little less barbaric,
nor can we trace to them any well-recognized
custom or fundamental
principle of our present laws. "In
the barbarous specimens of legislation
due to the era of Saxon and
Danish rule," says a late able writer on
this subject, "the few texts of Roman
law which occur appear to us traceable
through the Papal canons. How
faint is the impression which even
the Anglo-Saxon laws have left upon
our system? We have still the local
court and the local officers, and some
of the rude democratic elements of
judicial procedure and constitutional
law have been nurtured into real
civilized liberty, but happily for us,
the harsh and partial regulations
savoring of original Teutonic savageness
which awarded the various penalties
of crime have passed away, and
the ancient absence of all expressed
regulation in many most important
points has been supplied by the legislation
of more enlightened times and
more cultivated men."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> After the
arrival of St. Augustine, towards the
close of the sixth century, the
gradual evangelization of the island
of Britain necessitated the abolition
of the heathen customs, the basis of
the Anglo-Saxon legislation, such as
it was, and the introduction of a new
code of government. The primitive
ignorance of the inhabitants and the
subsequent decline of learning consequent
on the repeated incursions of
the Northmen, had the effect of limiting
whatever knowledge was still
possessed in the country to the ecclesiastics,
who, amid the most adverse
circumstances, and very often at the
sacrifice of their lives, fed the torch
of learning and kept its brilliancy undimmed
when all around was darkness.
They became not only the makers
but the dispensers of the law, for,
though surrounded on all sides by
anarchy and ignorance, they had still
the guidance of their canons and
some acquaintance with the elaborate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>code of the empire. The clergy, admits
Blackstone, "like the Druids,
their predecessors, were proficient in
the study of the law."</p>

<p>This marked and beneficial interference
of the ministers of the church
in the legislative and judicial affairs
of newly converted nations not only
arose out of political and social necessity,
but may be considered as a logical
sequence of the establishment of
Christianity itself. "The arbitrative
authority of ecclesiastical pastors,"
says Hallam, "if not coeval with
Christianity, grew up very early in
the church, and was natural and
even necessary to an isolated and
persecuted society, accustomed to
feel a strong aversion to the imperial
tribunals, and even to consider
a recurrence to them as hardly consistent
with their profession; the
early Christians retained somewhat
of a similar prejudice even after the
establishment of their religion. The
arbitration of their bishops still seemed
a less objectionable mode of settling
differences, and this arbitrative
jurisdiction was powerfully supported
by a law of Constantine which
directed the civil magistrate to enforce
the execution of episcopal
awards."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Justinian went even further
than his illustrious ancestors, for
he not only gave the bishops in the
first instance, without the consent of
the parties, the power of trying temporal
causes in which the defendant
was an ecclesiastic, but the episcopal
order was absolutely exempted by
him from all secular jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>If such clerical intrusion into the
province of the civil magistrate was
not only tolerated but encouraged in
the best and most Catholic days of
the Western and Eastern empires, how
much more salutary must it have
been in its effects among the semi-civilized
and turbulent Saxons and
Northmen! Unfortunately, scarcely
any record is left to us of the labors
of the priesthood in this direction
during those centuries which preceded
the Norman conquest, for the compilations
of Alfred and Edward the
Confessor are irreparably lost; but
here and there we catch a glimpse
of their presence legislating or deciding
causes. Thus, as early as <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
787, at a provincial council held at
Calcluith, a place long obliterated
from the map of England, it was solemnly
enacted "that none but legitimate
princes should be raised to
the throne, and not such as were engendered
in adultery or incest." "But
it is to be remarked," says Hallam,
"that, although this synod was strictly
ecclesiastical, being summoned by
the Pope's legate, yet the kings of
Mercia and Northumberland, with
many of their nobles, confirmed the
canons by their signatures."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Another
instance of clerical legislation is to
be found in the canons of the Northumbrian
clergy, and that one of peculiar
interest to students of law and
history, presenting, as it does, the first
germ of that glory of English law not
inaptly called the palladium of the
subject's liberty&mdash;trial by jury.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> "If
a king's thane," says the canon,
"deny this (the practice of heathen
superstition), let twelve be appointed
for him, and let him take twelve of
his kindred or equals (<i>maga</i>) and
twelve British strangers, and if he fail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>let him pay for his breach of law
twelve half-marcs; if a landholder
(or lesser thane) deny the charge, let
as many of his equals and as many
strangers be taken for him as for a
royal thane, and if he fail let him pay
for his breach of law six half-marks;
if a ceorl deny it, let as many of his
equals and as many strangers be
taken for him as for the others, and if
he fail let him pay twelve oræ for his
breach at law."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> This quasi-jury system
appears to have been applied to
other cases, for we learn from the history
of Ramsey, published in Gales's
<cite>Scriptores</cite>, that a controversy relating
to some land between the monks
and a certain nobleman was brought
into the county court, when each
party was heard in his own behalf,
and after its commencement it was referred
by the court to thirty-six thanes,
equally chosen by both sides.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The invasion and speedy conquest
of Britain by the Normans not only
overturned the Saxon dynasty, and reduced
the people of that and the Danish
race remaining in the country
to a condition of absolute servitude,
but introduced a new language and
completely revolutionized the municipal
laws of the entire nation. The
sacrifice of human life incident to
the conquest was small in comparison
to the amount of misery, wretchedness,
and degradation entailed on
the vanquished for centuries afterwards
by the conquerors-men gathered
from every quarter of Europe,
whose fortunes were at their swords'
points, and whose fidelity and support
were only to be purchased by
the fruits of plunder and spoliation.
Still, it must be admitted that the
conquest had its advantages, and very
great ones. From the departure of
the Romans until the arrival of William,
England proper cannot be said
to have enjoyed any appreciable respite
from foreign wars or domestic
dissensions. The Britons, deprived
of the powerful protection of the legions,
were constantly harassed by
their rapacious neighbors from the
north side of the Tweed, and in trying
to escape from them they fell into the
clutches of their false allies, the Angles
and Saxons, and narrowly escaped
extermination. These latter were
no sooner settled in the country than
they established as many monarchies
as they had chiefs, and, having for a
time no foreign foe to contend against,
readily turned their arms against each
other on the slightest provocation.
Weakened and distracted, they soon
fell an easy prey to the piratical
Northmen, who, under Canute and
his successors, fastened on the fair
lands of the middle and northern
portions of the island and on the
contiguous sea-ports a grip so tenacious
that all the subsequent efforts
of the Saxon monarchs could not unloosen
it. This diversity of race and
traditional forms of government naturally
gave birth to laws and customs
entirely at variance with each
other in letter and spirit, and what
was binding in one section was unknown
or disregarded in another.
The Normans, with the thoroughness
of genuine conquerors, disregarded all
such local distinctions, and reduced
the entire native population to a
level, thane and ceorl alike being
made to endure the same burdens of
servitude and compelled to obey implicitly
the will of their new masters.</p>

<p>But the Normans were Christians,
at least by profession, and boasted
of a species of rude chivalry which prevented
them from imitating the excesses
of their pagan predecessors. While
greedy enough for the secular lands
of the defeated Saxons, they seldom
interfered with churches or institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
of learning and charity; on the
contrary, they were wise enough to
protect the one and encourage the
other in every manner possible consistent
with their design of total subjection.
They introduced generally
the new system of feuds and a foreign
hierarchy, it is true, but they did
not deprive the people of the consolations
of religion, and they gave to
the country for the first time unity,
the necessary precursor of rational
freedom, and a national government
with uniform laws, which, if born
amid the clash of arms, rested its
principal claims to support on the
ways of peace.</p>

<p>The feudal system, though burdened
with its aids, reliefs, seisin,
wardship, and many other equally
onerous conditions, was for that time
the best and in fact the only proper
form of government for England, and
it is mainly to its uniform establishment
by the conquerors, and to the
judicious statesmanship of her great
ecclesiastical lawyers, who subsequently
gradually mitigated its harsher
features, that the past and present
greatness of that country is to be
traced. The theory that the sovereign,
representing the majesty of the
nation, was the owner of all the lands
of the kingdom, and that directly or
indirectly all the occupiers of the
soil were his tenants, holding by
right of fealty and service, gave to
the people what they so long wanted,
a centre of unity and a common authority
to which they could look for
redress and protection. Besides, the
system had become so general on the
Continent, and had proved so admirable
a machine for defence or aggression,
that its adoption by the new
Anglo-Norman kingdom had become
a political necessity.</p>

<p>Though sadly behind many of her
sister nations in the arts of government,
England was not at the time
of the conquest altogether deficient
in the knowledge of civil or common
law. On the contrary, she had many
eminent professors of both. The
monks of Croyland and Spaulding
were distinguished as jurists, and Egelbert,
Bishop of Chichester, is said,
even by Norman authorities, to have
been thoroughly acquainted not only
with the canons and what was then
known of the Roman civil law, but
with "all the ancient laws and customs
of the land."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The Normans,
however, preferring to place their
own countrymen in positions of trust
and influence, invited from the Continent
many learned bishops and professors,
to whom they gave the charge
of the principal sees and universities,
and these, having been trained in the
schools of Italy and France, soon
substituted the study of the clearer
and more equitable regulations of the
lately-revived civil law for the illogical
and conflicting customs of the
natives. Thus the Pandects of Justinian
were introduced into England
by Vicarius, professor of canon law
at Oxford, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1138, and he was succeeded
by Accorso, a doctor of the
civil law. Bishop Grosseteste wrote a
treatise in favor of the study of Roman
law, and Theobald, Archbishop
of Canterbury, founded a professorship
in Oxford to promote the same
object. Of the latter prelate, it is
said that he was accustomed to retain
in his house "several learned persons
famous for their knowledge of law,
who spent the hours between prayers
and dinner in lecturing, disputing,
and debating causes."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The conquerors of the Anglo-Saxons,
though by no means deficient in
the scholarship and accomplishments
of that rude age, were too intent on
retaining by force the possessions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>they had won by the strong arm, to
cultivate the arts of peace, and, consequently,
the framing of the laws,
the judicial authority, and even the
pleading of causes, necessarily devolved
on the ecclesiastics. Hallam,
a writer equally prejudiced with Blackstone,
though a much better historian,
is forced to admit that "the
bishops acquired and retained much
of their ascendency by a very respectable
instrument of power&mdash;intellectual
superiority. As they alone
were acquainted with the art of writing,
they were naturally entrusted
with political correspondence and
the making of the laws."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> And it
was well for the conqueror and conquered
alike that it was so, for to
them, and them alone, was given the
skill and authority to restrain with
one hand the ruthless oppressions of
the lawless barons, and with the
other to alleviate the sufferings of a
down-trodden people. To the wisdom
that proceeds from long communion
with the works of great and
good men they joined the authority
of the church, which they failed not
to call into requisition when persuasion
and reasoning equally failed.
To them we owe every successful effort
that was made in the middle age
of England's history, either against
the tyranny of the crown or the injustice
of the nobles. <i>Magna Charta</i>,
that famous instrument, which, like
our own constitution, is so frequently
talked about and so little understood,
issued from the fertile brain of Archbishop
Langton, and was signed by
every bishop and abbot in the land.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
It was they who took up the serf, educated
and ordained him, and made
him not only the equal but in many
cases the superior of his late master.
They also regulated the alienation and
descent of lands, and by their introduction
of fines and recoveries, uses
and trusts, and other forms of conveyance,
not only abolished many of the
worst evils of feudalism, but even, according
to Blackstone, "laid the
foundation of modern conveyancing."
For many centuries they were the
confidential advisers of kings, their
trusted ambassadors abroad, and their
names always appeared first in every
writ summoning a council or parliament
to legislate for the welfare of
the realm, and the laws thus made
were regularly dispensed in the county
courts by the bishops and the civil
magistrates sitting together with
equal jurisdiction.</p>

<p>But it was in the court of chancery
that the wisdom, clemency, and equity
of the bishops of those days shone
with the greatest brilliancy. This
was a court of extraordinary jurisdiction,
unknown in England before the
conquest and unparalleled in contemporary
nations. The chancellor and
his assistants, almost without exception,
up to the time of Wolsey, were
ecclesiastics. Their decisions, resting
upon conscience alone, though unsupported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
by express statute or even
in contravention of its letter, had
all the force of legal enactments, and
formed, collectively, the basis of much
of our modern remedial legislation,
as well as an unerring rule for the
guidance of our highest civil justices.
The affairs of married persons, infants,
idiots, corporations, bankrupts,
testators and intestates, grantors and
grantees of land, and of nearly every
conceivable condition of life, are even
at the present day within the special
and almost exclusive jurisdiction of
our courts of equity. In the words
of a distinguished English lawyer,
"It gives relief for and against infants,
notwithstanding their minority,
and for and against married women,
notwithstanding their coverture. All
frauds and deceits for which there
is no redress at common law, all
breaches of trust and confidence, and
unavoidable casualties, by which obligors,
mortgagors, and others may be
held to incur penalties and forfeitures,
are here remedied. This court
also gives relief against the extremity
of unreasonable engagements
entered into without consideration,
obliges creditors who are unreasonable
to compound with an unfortunate
debtor, and makes executors,
etc., give security and pay interest
for money which is to be long
in their hands. The court may confirm
the title to lands, though one
has lost his writings, render conveyances
which are defective through
mistake or otherwise good and perfect.
In chancery, copyholders may
be relieved against the ill-usage of
their lords, enclosures of land which
is common may be decreed, and this
court may also decree the disposition
of money or lands given to charitable
uses, oblige men to account
with each other," etc.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>A system of laws like that of Chancery,
so comprehensive and so equitable,
defined and administered by a
long succession of the most upright
and enlightened men of the land,
could not but have left a deep impression
on the entire jurisprudence
of the people who profited by its
protection&mdash;an impression, indeed,
that neither the mental obliquity of
the fanatic nor the sophistry of the
pedant has been able to obliterate.
"So deep hath this canon law been
rooted," says Lord Stairs, "that
even where the Pope's authority is
rejected, yet consideration must be
had to these laws, not only as those
by which the church benefices have
been erected and ordered, but as
likewise as containing many equitable
and profitable provisions, which
because of their weighty matter and
their being once received may more
fitly be retained than rejected."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Had the prelates and priests of
the Saxon and Norman periods done
nothing for our law but what we find
in the decisions of their equity courts,
they would have conferred upon us
an incalculable blessing, one equally
calculated to liberalize the spirit of
legislators, enlighten the understanding
of jurists, and make government
what it was designed to be, a shield
for the weak and helpless, and a terror
to the wicked and dishonest.
But, as we have seen on the authority
of writers conspicuous for their anti-Catholic
bigotry, they did infinitely
more. Statesmen as well as lawyers,
they framed most of our best statutes
as well as adjudicated upon them,
and they originated or perfected every
feature in our entire code which
has stood the test of time, and enlarged
civilization from trial by jury
to the unqualified right of every man
to dispose of his property as seems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>best to himself. They have thus
placed us under obligations which
we can only in part repay by transmitting
their maxims unimpaired to
our descendants, and by, at length,
doing justice to their memories. And
now, as we believe that the world is
growing wiser as it is growing older,
when time has healed many of the
wounds inflicted during the great
schismatic revolt of the sixteenth
century, and, uninfluenced by passion
or unawed by power, the scales
of prejudice are falling from the eyes
of those who through the fault of
their fathers are aliens to the truth,
it is not too much to hope that they
will neither be ashamed nor afraid to
acknowledge how much they are indebted
to the church and her ministers
for the generally admirable system
of laws under which we live&mdash;laws
which are at once our highest
boast and best protection.</p>

<p><i>Aunt S.</i> Would your worship like
to hear about the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">animas</i>?</p>

<p><i>Don F.</i> Without delay. Let us
hear about the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">animas</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aunt S.</i> There was once a poor
woman who had a niece that she
brought up as straight as a bolt.
The girl was a good girl, but very
timid and bashful. The dread of
what might become of this child,
if she should be taken away, was
the poor old woman's greatest anxiety.
Therefore, she prayed to God,
night and day, to send her niece a
kind husband.</p>

<p>The aunt did errands for the house
of a gossip of hers that kept boarders.
Among the guests of this house was
a great nabob, who condescended to
say that he would marry if he could
find a girl modest, industrious, and
clever. You may be sure that the
old woman's ear was wide open. A
few days afterwards, she told the
nabob that he would find what he
was looking for in her niece, who
was a treasure, a grain of gold, and
so clever that she painted even the
birds of the air. The gentleman said
that he would like to know her, and
would go to see her the next day.
The old woman ran home so fast
that she never saw the path, and
told her niece to tidy up the house,
and to comb her hair, and dress herself,
the next morning, with great care,
for they were going to have company.</p>

<p>When the gentleman came, the
next day, he asked the girl if she
knew how to spin.</p>

<p>"Spin, is it?" answered the
aunt.</p>

<p>"She takes the hanks down like
glasses of water."</p>

<p>"What have you done, madam?"
cried the niece when the gentleman
had gone, after giving her three
hanks of flax to spin for him. "What
<em>have</em> you done? And I don't know
how to spin!"</p>

<p>"Go along," said the aunt, "go
along, for a poor article that will sell
well, <i>and don't set your foot down</i>,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> but
let it be as God will."</p>

<p>"Into what a thorn-brake you
have put me, madam!" said the
niece, crying.</p>

<p>"Well, see that you get out of it,"
answered the aunt; "but these three
hanks must be spun, for your fortune
depends upon them."</p>

<p>The poor girl went to her room
in sore distress, and betook herself
to imploring the blessed souls, for
which she had great devotion.</p>

<p>While she prayed, three beautiful
souls, clothed in white, appeared to
her, and told her not to be troubled,
for they would help her in return for
the good she had done them by her
prayers; and, taking each one a
hank, they changed the flax into
thread as fine as your hair in less
time than would be worth one's while
to name.</p>

<p>When the nabob came, the next
day, he was astonished to see the
result of so much diligence united
with so much skill.</p>

<p>"Did I not tell your worship so!"
exclaimed the old woman, beside
herself with delight.</p>

<p>The gentleman asked the girl if
she knew how to sew.</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't she?" answered
the aunt with spirit. "Pieces
of sewing are no more in her hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>than cherries would be in the big
snake's mouth."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The gentleman then left her linen
to make him three shirts, and, not
to tire your worship, it happened
just as it had the day before; and
the same took place on the day after,
when the nabob brought a satin
waistcoat to be embroidered; except
that, when, in answer to her many
tears and great fervor, the souls appeared
and said to the girl, "Don't
be troubled, we are going to embroider
this waistcoat for you," they added,
"but it must be upon a condition."</p>

<p>"What condition?" inquired the
girl anxiously.</p>

<p>"That you ask us to your wedding."</p>

<p>"Am I going to be married?" said
the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the souls, "to
that rich man."</p>

<p>And so it turned out, for, when the
gentleman came, the next day, and
saw his waistcoat so exquisitely
wrought that it seemed as though
hands of flesh could not have touched
it, and so beautiful that to look
at it fairly took away his eyesight,
he told the aunt that he wanted to
marry her niece.</p>

<p>The aunt was ready to dance for
joy. Not so the niece, who said to
her: "But, madam, what will become
of me when my husband finds out
that I don't know how to do anything?"</p>

<p>"Go along! <i>and don't make up
your mind</i>," answered the aunt. "The
blessed souls that have helped you
in other straits are not going to desert
you in this."</p>

<p>On the wedding-day, when the
feasting was at its height, three old
women entered the parlor. They
were so beyond anything ugly that
the nabob was struck dumb with horror.</p>

<p>The first had one arm very short,
and the other so long that it dragged
on the ground; the second was
humped and crooked; and the eyes
of the third stuck out like a crab's,
and were redder than a tomato.</p>

<p>"Jesus, Maria!" said the astonished
gentleman to his bride, "who are
those three scarecrows?"</p>

<p>"They are three aunts of my father,"
she replied, "that I invited to
my wedding."</p>

<p>The nabob, who was mannerly,
went to speak to the aunts and find
them seats.</p>

<p>"Tell me," he said to the first,
"what makes one of your arms so
short and the other so long?"</p>

<p>"My son," answered the old woman,
"it was spinning so much that
made them grow that way."</p>

<p>The nabob hurried to his wife and
told her to burn her distaff and spindle,
and to take care that she never
let him see her spin.</p>

<p>He immediately asked the second
old woman what made her so humpbacked
and crooked.</p>

<p>"My son," she answered, "I grew
so by working all the while at my
broidery-frame."</p>

<p>With three strides the gentleman
put himself beside his wife, and said
to her: "Go this minute, and burn
your broidery-frame, and take care
that in the lifetime of God I do not
catch you with another."</p>

<p>Then he went to the third old
woman, and asked her what made
her eyes look so red and as if they
were going to burst?</p>

<p>"My son," she answered, giving
them a frightful roll, "this comes of
continual sewing, and of keeping
my head bent over the work."</p>

<p>Before the words were out of her
mouth, the nabob was at his wife's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
side: "Go," said he, "gather all
your needles and thread, and throw
them into the well, and bear in mind
that the day I find you sewing, I will
sue for a divorce. The sight of the
halter on another's neck is warning
enough for me."</p>

<p><i>Aunt S.</i> And now, Señor Don
Fernan, my story is ended; I hope
that it has pleased you?</p>

<p><i>Don F.</i> Ever so much, Aunt Sebastiana;
but what I learn from it
is, that the souls, notwithstanding
that they are blessed, are very tricky.</p>

<p><i>Aunt S.</i> Now, señor, and is your
worship going to insist upon doctrine
in a romance, as if it were an
example? Why, stories are only to
make us laugh, and grow better without
precept or name of lesson. God
will have a little of all.</p>

<p><i>Don F.</i> True, Aunt Sebastiana;
and what you express with your
simple good sense is more wholesome
than the critical reverence of the
overstrict. But, uncle, I am not
going without another to correspond
with this, and it is your turn now. If,
as I think you have told me that
you were on other occasions, you
are a devotee of San Tomas,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> here
are some Havanas as an offering to
his saintship.</p>

<p><i>Uncle R.</i> Not to disoblige your
worship.</p>

<p><i>Don F.</i> But I must have the story;
I want it for a purpose.</p>

<p><i>Uncle R.</i> By which your worship
means to say that, without an
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ochavo</i>, you can't make up the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">real</i>.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
Well, let me think. Since the talk
is about <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">animas, animas</i> it is. Their
sodality in a certain place had for
mayordomo a poor <i>bread-lost</i><a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> of
a member, one of those who are
always like the sheep that misses the
mouthful.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> He was without a cloak,
and went with teeth chattering and
limbs benumbed with cold. What
does he do but go and order himself
a cloak made, and, without so much
as saying <i>chuz</i> or <i>muz</i>,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> or by your
leave, sirs, take money from the
funds of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">animas</i> to pay for it.
When it came home, he put it on, and
went into the street as consequential
and <i>high-stomached</i> as those rich folks
recently raised from the dust. But
at every step he took, some one
gave the cloak a jerk, and though
he kept a sharp lookout he could
not see who. The instant he drew
it up on the left shoulder, down it
slid from the right, causing him to
keep a continual hitch, hitch. You
would have thought he had a thorn
in his foot.</p>

<p>As he went along, pestered and
chap-fallen, trying to make out what
it could mean, he met a gossip of
his, who was mayordomo to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Hermandad
del Santísimo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> This fellow
was stalking loftily, filling the street
with his air that said, <i>Get out of the way,
I am coming</i>. After "How d'ye do?"
this one asked the other, "What is
the matter, comrade, that you seem
so down at the mouth lately?"</p>

<p>"Matter enough!" answered he
of the souls, pulling his cloak up on
the right shoulder while it slipped off
from the left. "Know that in the
beginning of the winter I found myself
in difficulties. I had sown a
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pegujar</i><a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> without seeing the color of
wheat. My wife brought me two
boys, when, with the nine I had already,
one would have been too
many; the delivery cost her a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>sickness, and me the eyes of my
face. In few, I was just stuck to
the wall like a star-lizard, and hungrier
than an ex-minister. I had to
borrow money of the souls to get
this cloak; but what the seven ails
it I don't know, for, whenever I put
it on, it seems as though somebody
was giving it a pull here and a jerk
there. Two rudder-pins couldn't
hold it fast to my shoulders."</p>

<p>"You did wrong, my friend," responded
the steward of El Santísimo.
"If, like me, you had taken a
loan of a great powerful and <em>giving</em>
personage, you wouldn't have to go
about as you do, chased and persecuted
for the debt. If you borrow
of miserable destitute wretches, what
can you expect but that the poor
things will try to get back their own
when they need it so much?"</p>

<h2>HOW ROME LOOKED THREE CENTURIES AGO.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></h2>


<p>Let us suppose a company of
travellers through Italy&mdash;strangers
from foreign climes, England, Germany,
and France&mdash;reaching Rome at
the period of the accession of Sixtus
V. to the throne of St. Peter. Approaching
the Eternal City by the
road from the north, they find themselves
before the Porta del Popolo.</p>

<p>Let us go in with them, and
through their eyes see the Rome of
that day.</p>

<p>On entering the gates, they pass
into an open place of irregular shape.
A large convent occupies nearly the
entire eastern side, which, with the
graceful <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">campanile</i>, or bell-tower, of
Santa Maria del Popolo, and the
high houses with wide portals between
the Corso, the Ripetta, and the
Babuino, are the only edifices visible.
The obelisk is not yet placed there
by Sixtus V., and the two little
churches with their heavy cupolas, so
well known to the modern tourist,
and the other buildings now seen
there&mdash;the work of Pius VII. and
the architect Valadier&mdash;did not then
exist. The Piazza del Popolo was
then less symmetrical, but more picturesque.
Wayfarers on horseback and
on foot pass to and fro; muleteers
arrive and depart, driving before them
lines of mules and beasts of burden.
In the centre of the place women are
washing at a circular basin. Idlers follow
and gaze at the strangers while
they make their declaration to the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bargel</i>, or public authority, and submit
their effects to the examination
of the custom officials. These preliminaries
through, our travellers may
pass into the city by a street leading
around the base of the Pincian Hill,
by another going toward the Tiber,
both of which have long ceased to
exist, or by the well-known Corso.
Some find their way to the then celebrated
and already venerable hostelry,</p>


<h3>THE BEAR,</h3>

<p>widely known and greatly in vogue
ever since the reign of Sixtus IV. Its
peculiar octagon pillars fix the period
of its construction. Strange to relate,
this patriarch of hotels, which
has seen four centuries and twenty
generations of travellers pass over its
head and through its halls, has continued
in existence, and is still open
as a tavern in Rome to this day.
True, its guests are now no longer,
as they were in the sixteenth century,
such personages of distinction as
foreign prelates, noted scholars, philosophers
like Montaigne, and, soon
afterward, the earliest known tourists.
Its inmates and frequenters of
the nineteenth century are now country
traders, cattle dealers, and wagoners.</p>

<p>Others of our travellers who intend
to make a longer stay in Rome
seek out the houses in the neighborhood
of the Pantheon or the Minerva,
nearly all of which are let out to strangers
in rooms or suites. These apartments
are luxuriously fitted up and ornamented
with the then famous Cordova
leather hangings, and richly sculptured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
and gilded furniture. Everything
is brilliant to the eye, but the
nineteenth century tourist would have
found fault with the lack of cleanliness
and the stinted supply of fresh
linen.</p>

<p>With yet others of these travellers,
let us enter</p>


<h3>THE CORSO,</h3>

<p>the Via Lata of the ancient Romans.
There is no sign of business
on it at this early day. But few of
the aristocracy have as yet transferred
their residences here, but it already
wears an air of life and animation,
and is well filled at the hours
of the promenade.</p>

<p>We pass along between vineyards
and vegetable gardens. A single
large edifice just completed strikes
the stranger's attention. It is the
magnificent Ruspoli palace, built by
Rucellai, the Florentine banker, upon
the designs of his countryman Ammanati.</p>

<p>Now we reach the Via Condotti,
to-day well-known to every American
who ever saw Rome. Let us
turn into it to the left, and traverse it
to the Piazza della Trinita (now
Piazza di Spagna), whence we may
scale the hill above and obtain a
commanding view of the entire city.</p>

<p>In doing this, we pass through
the then worst quarter of Rome, physically
and morally, for the triangle
formed by the Corso, the Via Condotti,
and the Babuino was at once
of the most evil repute and the most
unhealthy in all Rome. In this quarter
were sure to break out all the epidemics
which at that period occasionally
decimated the population of
Rome. Seeking to mount</p>


<h3>THE PINCIAN HILL,</h3>

<p>the traveller of that day might have
looked in vain for the broad flight
of easy marble steps we now see
there, and he ascended by a steep
and narrow staircase. On reaching
the summit, he found himself on the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">collis hortulorum</i> of the Romans, and
saw it still covered with vineyards and
tilled fields, and the comparatively
modern innovation of the garden
of the Villa Medici. The elegant
world of Rome in 1585 had to content
themselves with taking their
promenade and their enjoyment of
the evening air about the Porta del
Popolo, and knew naught of the
charming promenade, the delightful
walks, the purer breeze, and the beautiful
view which later generations enjoy
on the hill above it.</p>

<p>The great painters of the succeeding
age who came to Rome, the Carracci,
the Domenichinos, the Guidos,
and the Salvator Rosas, were the
first to discover the attractions of the
Pincian Hill, and, braving custom,
lack of accommodation, the bad
neighborhood, and the unhealthy
contiguity of the quarter below, were
the first to establish themselves upon
it. This was the foundation of the
modern Pincian settlement.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the writer of this
article occupied apartments in the first
house to the right on reaching the
summit of the Pincian steps. The
tradition of the house ran to the effect
that these rooms had been occupied
by Salvator Rosa; and if, as
they say, he selected them for the
sake of their view of the setting sun,
he chose well, for all the sunsets of
Rome may there be seen to the best
advantage. As an American, however,
views of the setting sun in Italy
were not specially attractive to us,
and we always regretted for Salvator
Rosa's sake that he had never seen
a transatlantic sunset, compared with
which those at Naples and Rome are
tame spectacles. The traditional
"beauty of an Italian sunset" is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
of the many English provincialisms
we have adopted and believed in
along with numerous other errors embalmed
in the literature of England.
But we forget that we are standing
on the Pincian in 1585. All is silent
and deserted around us, and
Rome is spread out at our feet.</p>

<p>To the left are the salient points,
the seven hills&mdash;for the Pincian
was not one of them&mdash;the towers
of the Capitol, the ruins of the palace
of the Cæsars in the Farnese gardens
on the Palatine, the belfry of Santa
Maria Maggiore on the Esquiline, the
Quirinal, as yet without the imposing
mass of the pontifical palace. The
Rospigliosi palace was not yet built,
but the villa of Cardinal Sforza is
seen, the same afterward known as
the Barberini palace. We turn our
eyes upon the lower city&mdash;inhabited
Rome&mdash;and with difficulty make out
but three or four cupolas. On the
other hand, we see a perfect forest of
towers on every side, some of them
of prodigious size. On the left bank
of the Tiber, many of these towers
have of late years disappeared, but
the Trastevere, as might be expected,
is still full of them&mdash;so full, indeed,
that a distant view of that quarter
presents the appearance of a comb
turned teeth upward. At that period,
these towers were the universal appendage
of an aristocratic dwelling.
San Gemiguiano near Sienna is the
only city in all Italy which has preserved
them to this day.</p>

<p>As our stranger of three hundred
years ago looks over Rome and listens
to the confused noises which
meet his ear, he is struck with the
rarity of the sound of bells and with
the small number of churches discernible.
The great Catholic reaction
consequent on the Reformation
had for fifty years moved souls, but
had not yet begun to move the
stones. It is the following era which
is to imprint upon Rome the architectural
marks of the church triumphant.
Later in the day, when our
strangers shall have descended into
the city and entered the churches,
they will be struck with the barrenness
of their interiors, and with the
absence of paintings. They are probably
ignorant of the fact that in
Italy, during the middle ages, there
was but one altar in a church, that
there alone Mass was celebrated,
that the mosaics and frescoes came
in with architectural innovation, and
that only toward the end of the sixteenth
century were altars and oil-paintings
multiplied with the side
chapels.</p>

<p>And yet this comparative quiet of
the city was animation itself, compared
with the sights and sounds discernible
from the same point at the
period when the popes returned to
Rome from Avignon.</p>


<h3>ROME IN 1400.</h3>

<p>The residence of the Cæsars was
covered with fields, vineyard, and
pasture. The Pantheon, the Coliseum,
some ruins, and detached columns
alone arose over the surrounding
waste as witnesses of former grandeur.</p>

<p>It was at this period that the Forum
received the name of "The Cow Pasture"
(Campo Vaccino). A remnant
of life yet remained in the plain
extending between the Tiber, the Pincian
Hill, and the Capitoline, but the
total population of Rome was reduced
to 17,000 souls, the great majority
of them huddled together and crowded
in hovels clustered under the shadow
of the baronial and aristocratic
strongholds. High battlemented
towers filled the city. Of the scores
in the Trastevere, that of the Auguilara
family exists to this day. On
the Tiberine island arose the Frangipani<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
towers, on the left bank those
of the Orsini, from the Porta del Popolo
to the Quirinal those of the
Colonna, while the towers of the
Mellini and the Sanguigni may still
be seen on the site of the stadium of
Domitian.</p>

<p>Of all the seven hills of Rome,
one only had not fallen into the
hands of the barons. The Capitoline
was still held by the people. But
commerce, industry, and the arts had
all disappeared. Rome had long
been cut off from connection with
the active world, and when the work
of material revival and rebuilding
began, not only architects and sculptors,
but stone masons and carpenters
had to be brought in from Tuscany
and Umbria.</p>


<h3>AN ARCHITECTURAL RETROSPECT.</h3>

<p>Under the pontificates of Sixtus
IV. and his two successors, Pintelli,
a pupil of Brunellesco, ornamented
Rome with such monuments as San
Pietro <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">in Montorio</i>, the façade of St.
Peter, and the Sistine Chapel. He
brought to his work the boldness and
taste of his master, who had made
profound study of the monuments
of ancient Rome.</p>

<p>This was the period of the first
<i>renaissance</i>, with its charms and imperfections,
at once timid and capricious,
imitating the models of antiquity
in their details, but utterly mistaking
the proportions which are the
essential, while succeeding brilliantly
in the accessories and ornaments borrowed
from the ancients and used
in profusion with some endeavor to
adapt them to the ideas and needs
of the period. The fundamental
principle of architecture, which requires
that the exterior should express
or respond to the use for which
the interior is destined, was unknown
to Pintelli.</p>

<p>To break the monotony of the
lines, the façade of any given building
was, as it were, framed, decoration
was freely used, and the object
was to please the eye, no matter by
what means. At that day, the architect
was also the painter, and the
majority of artists were both. The
first <i>renaissance</i> obtained its apogee
toward the year 1500. In the nature
of things it had then outlived
its day, and a change became indispensable
at the risk of degradation.</p>

<p>Fortunately Bramante was ready
to answer the call. He was from
Umbria, and Raphael was his nephew.
He had studied in the north
of Italy, where, amid plains devoid
of stone, the architect was forced to
use brick. Hence the novelty of
combination introduced by him in
Rome, whose inexhaustible stone
quarries were such ancient monuments
as the Coliseum. It is from
the absence of heavy building-stone
and the contrast of the German taste
of the Longobards with the Byzantine
style of Ravenna that the Lombard
style is begotten. It brought
with it precisely what the <i>renaissance</i>
most needed, namely, its exquisite
sentiment of proportions, and it forms
the transition between the two schools
of the <i>renaissance</i>, the latter of which
formed the golden era of architecture
in Italy.</p>

<p>Its reign in Rome has left indelible
traces. Its productions&mdash;and
among them are the court of St. Damas,
the Belvedere, the galleries of
the Vatican, the Giraud palace&mdash;were
the pride of the age. They taught the
comprehension of proportions, the
calculation of perspective, the culture
of harmony of detail and <i>ensemble</i>,
reformed false taste, and created
an epoch in profane architecture.
With increase of public security,
even the Roman barons began
to understand that the greatest beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
of the architectural art might be
found elsewhere than in a high tower
or a battlemented block-house. Even
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">mezzo-ceto</i>, or middle class, began
to contract a taste for something beyond
the absolutely necessary, and
sought to adorn even their modest
habitations. A private dwelling-house
built at this period and exclusively
<i>bramantesque</i> may still be seen in
Rome on the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">strada papale</i>, opposite
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Governo Vecchio</i>. It yet bears
the date of its construction (1500)
and the name of its builder.</p>

<p>After the death of Bramante appeared
Raphael, Michael Angelo,
Giulio Romano, and Balthasar Peruzzi,
who, prodigal of their treasures
of genius, created a golden age.</p>

<p>Romano's Villa Madama became
the type of the country-seat; Peruzzi's
Farnesina, that of the modern
palace. Raphael, more as painter
than as architect, composed the designs
of the palace Vidoni. It was
the great epoch of the culture of
simplicity in grandeur, of disdain for
the small and the superfluous, of
faithful and noble expression of the
idea conceived.</p>

<p>The models of antiquity were still
followed, but they were transformed.
The architect translated modern conceptions
into the sonorous but dead
and strange language of the old Romans.
In interior ornamentation,
however, the artist could give free
rein to his inspirations, and throw
off the trammels of the severe rules
scrupulously followed as to the façade
and the general composition of
the design. Alas! it was here they
planted the germs of degeneration
and decay. Public taste&mdash;never a
safe guide&mdash;seized upon and clung
to these prodigalities of an exuberant
and fantastic imagination supposed
to be inexhaustible. At Florence,
in his work on the chapel of
the Medicis, Michael Angelo was the
first to enter this flowery but treacherous
path.</p>

<p>We see and admire these niches,
windows, and ornaments, charming
indeed to the eye, but which have
no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d'être</i>. It was at a later
period, under the pontificate of Paul
III., that the painter of the "Last
Judgment" and the sculptor of "Moses"
revealed himself at Rome, as an
architect stamped his work on the Farnese
palace, and astonished the world
by reconstructing St. Peter's. Soon
this style gained the upper hand.
Simplicity yielded to riches; logic to
caprice; unrestricted liberty succeeded
the voluntary curb which the
great masters of the epoch had imposed
upon themselves. Presently
came pauses. Halts were made. As
in all human affairs, action and reaction
succeeded. Not so much in details
as in <i>ensemble</i>, Vignoli in Rome,
Palladio at Vicenza, and to a certain
degree Scamazzi in Venice, brought
back architecture to the sobriety of
the commencement of the century.</p>

<p>But the death of Michael Angelo
appeared to have completely demoralized
the architects who survived.
For thirty years he had reigned supreme.
In him alone had the popes
confidence; and upon architects employed
by them, they imposed the
obligation of following him. Piero
Ligorio, architect of St. Peter, was
dismissed because he manifested an
intention to put aside Michael Angelo's
plans. In thus officially guarding
the manes of the dead master,
they apparently hoped to transfer his
genius to those who succeeded him.
But it was a sad and fatal mistake.</p>

<p>The amount of building effected
in Rome during the last third of the
sixteenth century has never, probably,
been exceeded. In examining
the productions of that epoch, the
struggle between the servile imitators
of Buonarotti and the men of progress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
desirous, but through lack of
originality incapable, of emancipating
themselves, is readily discerned. But
let us leave this retrospect, descend
the steps of the Pincian Hill, and, traversing
the Piazza di Spagna and the
Via Condotti, enter</p>


<h3>THE CORSO AGAIN,</h3>

<p>at the points where to-day's tourist
sees the Via della Fontanella, by
which he goes toward the bridge of
St. Angelo, on his way to St. Peter's.
Here our travellers of 1585, passing
under the arch of Marcus Aurelius,
which separated the Corso into two
distinct parts, and was afterwards
swept away by Alexander VII. to
straighten and widen the thoroughfare,
find themselves really in Rome.
On either side are solidly built houses
without windows or balconies, covered
with frescoes, and so high that
the sun reaches the pavement only
at mid-day. Looking down the Corso,
the traveller perceives at its extremity,
above the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">palazetto</i> of St.
Mark, the battlemented convent of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ara Cœli</i>, and the tower of the Capitol.
Leaving the Colonna place and
the Antonine column to the right,
our travellers soon reach the place
and palace of St. Mark, with its immense
battlemented façades, surmounted
by a colossal tower built of
stone almost entirely taken from the
Coliseum. With the exception of
some few modifications in the windows
of the façade fronting on the
Via del Gesú, and in the roof of the
tower which formerly projected, this
palace&mdash;now known as the Austrian&mdash;to-day
appears to us as the traveller
saw it three hundred years ago.
Near by is the Church and Convent
of the Apostles, where in after-years
were shown the cells occupied by
the two friars who became respectively
Sixtus V. and Clement XIV.
(Ganzanelli). When the monks of
this convent called in a body upon
Sixtus V. to felicitate him on his accession,
the cook of the community
went up alone to the pope at the
close of the audience. "Holy Father,"
said he, "you doubtless remember
the wretched repasts of
which you partook when with us?"
Sixtus replied that the expression
"wretched repasts" perfectly described
the meals in question. "Well,"
continued the cook, "the cause was
the want of good water&mdash;give us
water."</p>

<p>Sixtus declared that this was the
only reasonable demand yet made of
him, and immediately ordered the
construction in the ancient court of
a beautiful fountain, which, although
much injured by time, yet exists.</p>

<p>Still progressing towards the Capitol,
our travellers pass the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gesú</i>. In
the small house adjoining it Ignatius
Loyola died, and St. Francis Borgia
has but lately expired there. And
now they ascend to the Capitol by
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cordonata</i> of Michael Angelo.
Looking still onward, they catch a
glimpse of the Forum (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Campo Vaccino</i>),
enlivened only by droves of
browsing cattle and here and there
a searcher of buried antique statues.
Beyond the Arch of Titus all is silent
solitude.</p>

<p>The modern, active, living</p>


<h3>ROME OF THAT DAY</h3>

<p>was within the triangle bounded by
the Corso, the Tiber, and the Capitol.
Our travellers turn their faces
towards the St. Angelo Bridge, and
approach it by long, narrow, and
crooked streets, nearly corresponding
with the Via Giulia and the Monserrato
which we to-day traverse.
This was the Faubourg St. Germain
of the period, full of palaces, but
stately and silent. The strangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
find the activity, movement, display,
and exuberant activity of Rome in
the street now known as the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Banchi</i>,
then lined with the residences of
wealthy bankers, in the rich Spanish
quarter beyond the Piazza Navona,
in the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tordinone</i> and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Coronari</i>.</p>

<p>From the rising to the setting of
the sun, throngs of people fill these
badly paved thoroughfares, which
are more thickly lined with palaces
as they approach the bridge. Our
strangers are impressed with the
great crowd of people, and are of
the opinion that it exceeds that of
the Marais in Paris, and is second
only to the throngs they saw in Venice.
About the Pantheon and the
Minerva are the houses already mentioned
where travellers and visitors to
Rome find furnished suites of apartments&mdash;the
Fifth Avenue and St.
Nicholas Hotels of the period. A few
years later (1595), on beholding this,
the Venetian ambassador writes that
"Rome has reached the apogee of
its grandeur and prosperity."</p>

<p>With difficulty a passage through
the crowd is effected, and the task is
rendered even dangerous by the large
number of carriages in circulation.</p>

<p>In 1594, there were eight hundred
and eighty-three private carriages in
the city. They were almost an essential.
The great St. Charles Borromeo
said, "There are two things
necessary in Rome&mdash;save your soul
and keep a carriage." And a singular-looking
carriage it was to our
eyes. In shape resembling a cylinder
open at both ends, with doors at
either side, knocked and tossed about
in a sort of basket on four clumsy
wheels. The elegants and beaux of
the day usually had an opening in
the top of the vehicle through which,
as they progressed, they admired
fair ladies at their windows. "They
make an astrolabe of their carriage,"
thundered a preacher in denunciation
of the practice. The crowd increases
as the St. Angelo Bridge is approached,
and it equals the human pressure
of the period of the jubilee as described
by Dante:<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

</div></div></div>


<p>No ladies are seen. They seldom
go out, and then only in carriages.
We find the modern Italians highly
demonstrative. Their ancestors were
more so, as our travellers noticed at
every step. Men meeting acquaintances
in the street exchanged profound
bows. Friends embraced
"with effusion." People threw themselves
on their knees before those of
whom they had favors to ask.</p>


<h3>DINNERS AND BANQUETS</h3>

<p>for invited guests were sumptuous
and of long duration. The culinary
art of that epoch&mdash;as we learn from
a work of Bartholomew Scarpi, the
<i>Grand Vatel</i> of the sixteenth century
and head cook of the saintly Paul
V., whose personal meals cost sixty
cents a day, but who, in state receptions,
entertained magnificently&mdash;was
something wonderful, according to
our modern ideas. For grand dinners,
there were four courses. The
first consisted of preserved fruits and
ornamented pastry, from which, on
being opened, little birds flew out,
making it literally a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vol au vent</i>.
Then came the other courses composed
of a multitude of the most diverse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>dishes, poultry with all the
feathers on, capons cooked in bottles,
meat, game, and fish, alternating with
sweet dishes in confused pell-mell,
utterly subversive of all our modern
gastronomic ideas. Some dishes
were prepared with rose-water, and
substances the most heterogeneous
and contradictory were mingled in
the same preparations. The sublimity
of the style was to effect the
sharpest possible contrast of materials
and odors.</p>

<p>The wines most in favor were the
heady wines of Greece, the Malvoisy,
and the great Neapolitan
brands, the Lachrima and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mangiaguerra</i>,
described as black in color,
powerful, spirituous, and so thick that
it could almost be cut. So, at least,
reports the Venetian Bernardo Navagero,
writing from Rome in 1558:
"<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">E possente e gagliardo, nero e
tantospesso che si potria quasi tagliare</span>."</p>

<p>Before the dessert, the cloth was
removed, the guests washed their
hands, and the table was covered
with sweet dishes, highly perfumed,
preserved eggs, and syrups.</p>

<p>Both before and after the repast,
distinguished guests used what we
would now call finger-bowls and
mouth-glasses, demonstratively and
even noisily. On arising from table,
bouquets of flowers were distributed
among the guests. From contemporaneous
statements as to the cost of
various entertainments of that period,
we should judge that the Roman provision
supply was much cheaper than
we to-day find it in those marvels of
modern architecture, the Washington
and Fulton Markets. Thus, for instance,
a wedding-supper, given by a
Roman nobleman (Gottofredi), and
which was at the time (1588) noted
for its beauty as well as its extravagance,
cost five hundred crowns,
equivalent, allowing for the difference
in specie values, to about nine
hundred dollars of our money.</p>


<h3>THE HORSE-RACES ON THE CORSO,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></h3>

<p>during the carnival, are, of course,
witnessed by our travellers. These
races were formerly one of the traditional
holiday amusements of the
Piazza Navona, which is on the site
of a Roman amphitheatre, and they
were transferred to the Corso by Paul
II. (1468). Seated in the small room
of the corner of the Palazetto of St.
Mark, whose windows command a
view of the entire length of the Corso,
this good-natured pontiff, who was
fond of promoting the innocent amusement
of his subjects, witnessed the running,
and had the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">barberi</i> (little horses)
stopped at that point. The poor governors
of Rome have ever since borne
and still bear the servitude of this
tradition. Four hundred years have
gone by since Paul II. sat at the
window on the Corso, but to this
day the Governor of Rome, clothed
in the official robes, whose cut and
fashion have not varied a line in all
that time, must, in the very same
room and at the very same window,
witness the running and have the
horses stopped at the same points.
Under Gregory XIII. these races
had somewhat degenerated. Buffaloes
of the Campagna, as well as
horses, were run, and races were
even made for children and for Jews.
Sixtus V. reformed all this and made
new regulations, which, with slight
modifications, are to this day in
force.</p>


<h3>LITERATURE AND THE THEATRE.</h3>

<p>At the period of which we treat,
there existed a decided taste for the
drama&mdash;such as it then was&mdash;but it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>was a taste exercised under difficulties.
During the carnival of 1588,
permission was obtained, as a great
favor, from Sixtus V. to allow representations
by the Desiosi troupe, at
that time the most celebrated in Italy.
But the license was hampered with the
following conditions:</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The representations should
take place in the daytime.</p>

<p><i>Second.</i> No woman should appear
on the stage.</p>

<p><i>Third.</i> No spectator should be
admitted with arms about his person.</p>

<p>Such a public edifice as a theatre
was at that time unknown in Italy.
True, many princes had halls constructed
in their palaces for dramatic
representations, and the Olympic
Academy of Vicenza erected a building
for the purpose, which was completed
on the designs of Palladio.</p>

<p>As for the dramas represented, it is
easy to understand their inferiority
when we know that Guarini's <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Pastor
Fido</i> gained a reputation not yet entirely
lost, by reason not of its merit,
but because of the inferiority of every
dramatic production of the time.</p>

<p>The costumes, decorations, and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en scène</i> formed the main attractions,
but the plays themselves loudly
proclaimed the decay of literature.
They possessed neither originality,
invention, nor poetry. When we
contemplate our own elevated and
purified stage of the present period,
with its bouffe, Black Crook, blondes,
and brigands, how profoundly should
we not pity the benighted Italians of
1585!</p>

<p>About this time, the first edition
of Tasso's <cite>Jerusalem Delivered</cite> made
its appearance. Issued without the
author's consent, it was both defective
and incorrect. In spite of the
enmity of the Grand Duke Francis
and, what was more to be feared,
of the opposition of the Della Cruscan
Academy, the <cite>Jerusalem</cite> at once
achieved an immense success&mdash;a success
purely due to its beauty of diction.
Contemporary criticisms of
Italian poets whose names have
since become immortal read strangely
now. Tasso was sneered at, Ariosto's
merit seriously contested, and
Dante absolutely condemned.</p>

<p>"This poet," says Giuseppe Malatesta,
a distinguished writer of that
day, "has borrowed the wings of
Icarus to remove himself as far as
possible from the vulgar, and, by
dint of searching for the sublime, he
has fallen into an obscure sea of obscurities.
He is both philosopher
and theologian. Of the poet he has
only the rhyme. To measure his
hell, his purgatory, his paradise, one
needs astrolabes. To understand
them, one should constantly have
at hand some theologian capable of
commenting upon his text. He is
crude and barbarous; he strives to
be disgusting and obscure when it
would really cost him less effort to
be clear and elegant, resembling in
this certain great personages who,
possessed of an admirable calligraphy,
nevertheless, through pure affectation,
write as illegibly as possible."</p>

<h2>THE MOTHER OF PRINCE GALITZIN.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></h2>


<p>In presenting our American Catholic
readers with a notice of the <cite>Life
of the Princess Amelia Galitzin</cite>, it
would be sufficient apology to mention
that this illustrious lady was the
mother of the great religious pioneer
of Pennsylvania&mdash;that worthy priest
whose services in the cause of Catholicity
in our country have endeared
his name to the American church
and have kept his memory still alive
in the filial love born of a new generation
whose fathers he evangelized.</p>

<p>But even if this apostle-prince had
never landed on American shores;
never sacrificed an opulent position
and a brilliant career, to labor as a
humble missionary in the wild western
forests of Pennsylvania; never
indelibly engraved his name, as he
has done, on that soil, now teeming
with industrial and religious life,
there is that in the life of the princess,
his mother, which would amply
recommend it to our interested attention.</p>

<p>Her career was beyond the common
run of lives. It was wonderful
in its blending of the ordinary with
the extraordinary. It is the story of a
great, strong mind&mdash;a high-principled
soul, entrammelled in circumstances
commonplace, disadvantageous, and
entirely beneath it, struggling for ascendency
to its own level above
them. A notice, then, of her life
possesses a double interest for our
readers&mdash;its own intrinsic interest, and
that which it borrows from the foreshadowing
of the great and useful
life spent in our country, with which
we have already been made acquainted,
and of which, we are
glad to learn, we are soon to have a
more extended account.</p>

<p>The Princess Amelia Galitzin was
born at Berlin, in August, 1748. Her
father, the Count de Schmettau, a
field-marshal of Prussia, was a Protestant.
Her mother, the Baroness
de Ruffert, was a Catholic. This
difference in the religion of the parents
led to the understanding that
the children of the marriage should
receive, according to their sex, a different
religious education. Amelia,
the only daughter, was destined, then,
to be educated in the Catholic faith.
For this purpose she was sent, at the
early age of four years, to a Catholic
boarding-school at Breslau.</p>

<p>It seems that at this establishment
the religious as well as the secular
training was sadly defective; for, at
the end of nine years, the young
countess left the <i>pensionnat</i> with no
instruction, little piety&mdash;even that
little of a false kind&mdash;and with but
one accomplishment, a proficiency in
music, the result of the cultivation
of a great natural talent. As
for literary acquirements, she scarce
could read or write. Another school
was now selected for her, and
this selection reveals the negligent
character of her mother, who, from
failing to use a wise discretion,
or to exert that softening and moulding
influence that mothers hold as a
gift from nature, may be held accountable
for the troubled darkness
and painful wanderings of mind that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
afflicted her daughter in her curious
after-career. At thirteen she was
placed at a kind of day-college, in
Berlin, directed by an atheist. Such
a step would have been a dangerous
experiment, even with a child of the
most ordinary mind, whose impressions
are easily effaceable, but with
the self-reliant spirit and keen intellect
that were destined to be developed
in Amelia, it was more than
dangerous, it was a ruinous trial.
The results of her eighteen months'
attendance at this school were not
immediately apparent, at least they
were but negatively so. At scarcely
fifteen years of age, she left this
atheist school to become a woman
of the world, by making what
is technically called her entrance into
society. What that entailed on a
member of a noble house, and in a
gay capital like Berlin, especially the
Berlin of the eighteenth century, we
may well surmise. There was another
feature in its society worth
attention, beyond the stereotyped
round of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lévées</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i>, and midnight
revels of high life. The great dark
cloud of incredulity had just settled
on sunny France. France then
stood at the head of the western nations.
A reflection of her brilliancy
was found in surrounding societies.
Imitation of her tastes, literary and
material, was deemed no disgrace.
Even her quick, dancing, musical language
was ludicrously set, by fashion,
to the rough, guttural tones of the
Teutonic tongue&mdash;so great was her
fascinating influence. No wonder,
then, that the thick shadows of that
dark cloud in which she had shrouded
her faith should have fallen heavily
around her. They fell on Prussia,
and fell heaviest when Voltaire
became the guest of Frederick.
The fœtid, contagious atmosphere
floated in on the society of her capital.
To be rational was the rage,
when rational meant incredulous.
Statesmen became skilled in the new
philosophy. Since the king had
turned philosopher, grand ladies suddenly
found themselves profoundly
intellectual and controversial, and
their drawing-rooms became like the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons de Paris</i>&mdash;no longer the frivolous
halls of pleasure, the depots for
the lively gossip of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">niaiseries</i> of
life, but private school-rooms, inner
circles in aid of the grand revolt of
reason against God which had already
begun throughout Europe.</p>

<p>In such society, then, did this
young girl, fresh from an atheist
school, find herself at the age of
fifteen, with no arm of a Christian
to do battle for her soul; neither the
"shield of faith" nor "the sword of
the Spirit, which is the Word of
God." But, happily, that society
was not immediately to possess her
young heart. An <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>&mdash;a nameless
weariness&mdash;intensified by a morbid
self-love, now settled on her mind.
And it was in this trial that her defective
instruction first began to tell
against her. The only relic of its
early impressions left her was a confused
notion of the horrors of hell
and the power of the devil, which
now rose before her but to increase
her misery. Beyond that, she believed
in nothing, hoped for little in
this life, and saw not the next. True,
she accompanied her mother to Mass
on Sunday, but to her it was as an
idle show. She understood as little
about the ceremonies as about the
text of the delicately-bound French
prayer-book she was obliged to hold
in her hand. She could find nothing
in what she knew or saw of religion
to fill the void that caused the
weariness of her heart. She determined
to seek relief in reading. Her
father's library was scant. So she
sent rather a confiding request to
the proprietor of a neighboring reading-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
to supply a young lady
who was anxious to improve herself
with useful books. This gentleman's
ideas of improvement and utility
were somewhat singular, for he forthwith
dispatched a large packet of sensational
romances. With the same confiding
spirit she accepted the selection,
and novel after novel she fairly devoured,
devoting night and day to
her new occupation. That the frivolities
of a gay society had no attractions
for her as a resource in her
extremity, that they could not "minister
to her mind diseased," shows a
soul of no ordinary mould, and shows,
too, that it was not through the senses,
but through the intellect, that its cravings
were to be allayed. Comparative
peace of mind returned, for she
made her reading a very preoccupying
labor by keeping a diary of its
results and impressions. Music, always
her favorite pastime, she now
made her recreation.</p>

<p>She was just beginning to taste
the sweets of living in a little peaceful,
busy world within herself, when
a young lady, who had been an intimate
friend of hers, was admitted to
a share in her occupations. This
resulted in not only breaking her utter
isolation from society, but in leading
her to mingle in it once more.
The calm of the previous months was
not entirely undisturbed. At intervals
the thoughts of her utter irreligiousness
would conjure up again those
appalling images of Satan and hell,
and their recurrence became more
frequent as she relented in her labors.
But now in the gay drawing-room
assemblies she met many ladies
of her own rank who, professing to
be Catholics, did not hesitate to express
freely, in their brilliant conversations,
the sentiments of incredulity
which filled her own mind.
In their example she found her self-justification.
She believed it fashionable
to think and act as other ladies,
and so, dismissing what she now
deemed her idle fancies, she permitted
herself undisturbed to glide into
the easy way of unbelief.</p>

<p>But an unseen mercy followed on
her path, and soon again cast before
her warning signs of her danger.
Her fears of the supernatural grew
again; and this time, in spite of every
example, in spite of every effort to
treat them as fancies that could be
laughed away, they increased to
such an extent that her health became
endangered. Once more she formed
a plan of escape from her terrors
of mind and the weariness they entailed&mdash;this
time an unaccountable
and for her an unexpected one.
She resolved to devote herself to meditation,
that, as she said in her
journal, "by force of thought she
might raise herself to union with the
Supreme Being," and thus neutralize
the effects of the frightful pictures of
eternal punishments which wearied
her imagination. We cannot help
seeing in this effort a noble struggle
of a great mind, untutored in childhood,
and left in early youth without
guidance or encouraging support.</p>

<p>She immediately entered on her
new project, and made great and
persevering efforts; but she groped
in the dark and made little progress
in meditating. Yet these efforts
were not wholly unavailing. She
succeeded by her bare strength of
thought in impressing deeply and
thoroughly on her mind the dignity
of a highly moral life, which led
her to the conviction that everything
gross or vile was utterly unworthy
of the noble soul that dwelt within
us.</p>

<p>What child of sixteen have we
ever known or heard of whose young
life presents a history of mind so
curious and so wonderful? Few
even of riper years have ever displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
a mere, bare natural power of
soul at once so strong and so refined
as that which led Amelia to so
beautiful a conclusion.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, it was for her
a saving result in the change that
was now about to come over her position
in life. It was arranged at this
time, by her parents, that the young
countess should join the court, in
the capacity of lady robe-keeper
to the wife of Ferdinand, Prince
of Prussia, brother to Frederick
II.</p>

<p>If we called the court society of
that epoch gilded corruption, we
believe we would be epitomizing the
detailed chronicle of its character.
Yet, armed with her high-souled
conviction, Amelia glided untainted
through its seductions and scandals,
though her youth and beauty and
the affectionate simplicity of her
manners made her the object of
much attention.</p>

<p>From the character of her mind
we may well imagine that she had
little relish for her new duties. To
any one of a high order of intellect,
and consequent intellectual aspirations,
the mean, material duties of
arranging a wardrobe, sorting dresses,
seeing them set out in their respective
turns, and changed with every changing
fashion&mdash;in a word, being a mere
waiting-maid to any one, no matter of
what rank, must necessarily be irksome
and distasteful. And though
we will not draw the exaggerated sarcastic
picture that Lord Macaulay
gives of Frances Burney's life at the
court of England, yet the fact that
the young countess stole many an hour
from her irksome post and still more
wearying ceremonious court-pleasures
to enjoy the instructive conversation
of elderly men of known literary
tastes and acquirements, gives
us full ground for at least compassionating
her in a position so evidently
unbefitting her gifted and aspiring
mind.</p>

<p>In her twentieth year she accompanied
the princess on a summer
trip to the waters at Aix-la-Chapelle
and Spa. It was during their residence
at the former place she first
met and received the addresses of the
Prince Dmitri Galitzin. The story
of their love does not seem to possess
anything above the ordinary interest,
and even extended over a much
shorter period than is usual before
marriage. All we learn about it is,
that the match seemed very advantageous
in the eyes of her protectress
the princess and her brother, General
Count de Schmettau (her mother,
long extremely delicate, having died
during her residence at the court),
and that the marriage ceremony
was performed with great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> in
August of the same year in which
the proposal had been made and accepted.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after her marriage
she had to set out with her
husband for the court of St. Petersburg,
of which he was an attaché.
Her sojourn, however, in the Russian
capital was very brief, for soon after
his arrival the prince was sent as
ambassador to the Hague, in Holland.
Five years previously he had
filled the same post at Paris, where
he became the intimate friend of Voltaire
and Helvetius. For the latter
he paid the expenses of the publication
of his famously infamous work,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l'Esprit</i>. He himself seems to
have been quite a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</i>. He
contributed, while in Paris, to the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Savants</i>, and published
two or three works of a scientific and
political character. But to return.</p>

<p>A new life now opened for Amelia
at the Hague. She became the star
of the brilliant society that daily filled
the halls of the palace of the Prince
Ambassador of Russia; she lived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
courtly splendor, and received the
flattery of homage that queens might
have coveted.</p>

<p>She had now resided two years in
Holland, and had given birth to two
children, a daughter and a son. It
may be naturally expected that now
the duties of a mother would bring
her life and her mind to the level of
ordinary interest. Not so. The routine
duties of her station had all
along been tasteless to her. The
constant round of pleasures which engaged
her, the flatteries she received,
in which meaner minds would have
loved to live and revel, had for her
no soothing or beguiling influence;
not even the total change of existence
and occupation which married life
induces wrought any change upon
her spirit. An aching void was still
within her heart, and, seeing nothing
around her with which to fill it, she
began to pine away. At length a
strong inclination seized her, one of
those yearnings for some one project
which swallows all our thoughts and
to which all else must yield; we may
call it a humor precisely in Ben
Jonson's sense:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"When some one peculiar quality<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doth so possess a man that it doth draw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his effects, his spirits, and his powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their confluxions, all to run one way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This may be truly said to be a humor."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This humor was nothing less than
entire abandonment of the world and
its cares. Notwithstanding the obligations
of her married life or those
of her position in society, she determined
to retire to some solitary spot,
and there engage her mind in hard
study of difficult and dry subjects.</p>

<p>Alarmed for her health, and probably
deriving little comfort from such
a moody consort, her husband consented
to her retiring to live in a
small country villa a few miles from
the Hague. She engaged a distinguished
professor of the city, named
Hemsterhuys, to give her lessons in
Greek, with a view to following under
his guidance, too, a course of Greek
philosophy.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the moment she
entered with ardor on this uninviting
task, her mind became completely
calmed, and she felt a peace and
contentment which for years she had
not known.</p>

<p>Besides the seeking of her own
peace of mind, the resting the weariness
of her heart, she had another
object in view&mdash;to prepare herself to
be doubly the mother of her children
by imparting to them herself a thorough
education. In the six years
that she toiled in this seclusion, this
was the great sustaining motive of
her labors.</p>

<p>When the children grew to the
years of discretion, she relented in
her harder studies to devote herself
with no less assiduity to their early
instruction. Everything was made
subservient to that end. Even the recreations
requisite for herself, and the
amusements necessary for them, the
pleasure excursions away from home,
all were designed to open and mature
their young minds.</p>

<p>But in these respects Holland had
but poor resources. One quickly
wearies of its changeless lowlands.
It can boast of no wild scenery
which grows new at every gaze and
invites repeated visits, and it has few
places of any peculiarly instructive
interest. It was this consideration
that determined the princess to remove
to the more picturesque and
favored land of Switzerland, where
her husband owned a country-house
near Geneva.</p>

<p>Her preparations for this change
of residence were nearly completed,
when news reached her of the projects
of the Abbé de Furstenberg for
a reform in the method of public instruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>This Abbé de Furstenberg was
one of the most remarkable men of
that day in Germany.</p>

<p>Of noble birth, he received a thorough
civil and ecclesiastical education,
and at the age of thirty-five
found himself chief administrator,
spiritual and temporal, of the principality
of Münster, under the prince-bishop.
His administration was attended
with most marked success,
and had brought the little state to an
unequalled degree of prosperity, not
only religious and political, but even
commercial and military. His latest
labor was his educational reform regarding
the method of teaching. To
mature this scheme, he had studied,
consulted, and travelled much during
seven years. When, at length, he
published the result of his researches,
it was received far and near with
much applause, whose echoes had
now reached the Princess Amelia in
Holland on the eve of her departure
for Switzerland. She at once
indefinitely deferred this journey, and
resolved to lose no time in making
the acquaintance of this accomplished
ecclesiastic, in order to master under
his own guidance the details of this
new method of instruction. For this
purpose, in the May of the year 1779,
she set out for Münster, intending to
pay only a short visit. She remained
nineteen days, and, though the
greater part of the time was spent in
the company of the learned abbé,
she found it impossible in so short
a space to take in the result of his
experience. This, and probably a
certain charm which his great conversational
powers exercised over her,
made her determine to return again,
and, with the permission of her husband,
remain a whole year in Münster
before setting out for Switzerland.
Consequently, in the same
year, she took leave of her husband
and her old preceptor Hemsterhuys,
purposing not to return to the Hague,
but to pursue her Swiss project after
her year's sojourn at Münster.
But this programme was never to be
carried out. Any one who has ever
felt the influence of our affections on
our plans and schemes&mdash;how plastic
they are beneath them, how readily
they yield in their direction&mdash;will easily
divine the cause of this. In fact,
so strong had grown this intellectual
friendship between the princess and
the Abbé de Furstenberg that every
idea of going to Switzerland yielded
before it; so much so that, before
the end of the year, she had purchased
a house in Münster, and engaged
a country-château for the summer
months of every year.</p>

<p>All this time she had kept up a
frequent correspondence with her
husband and her old professor, and
she had made them promise to come
and spend as long a time as they
could spare every summer at her
country-seat.</p>

<p>She was yet in the unchristian portion
of her life. In her conversation
and communications with Hemsterhuys,
she had worked out a complete
scheme of natural virtue and
happiness, which she embodied in a
work entitled <i>Simon; or, The Faculties
of the Soul</i>. While we must admit
that this is a curious specimen of a
mere human, religionless view of a
virtuous and happy life, yet we cannot
allow that it could have been
drawn up had not some faint remembrances
of early Christian teaching
still lingered in the mind of the
authoress; much less can we grant
that it could have been realized in
any life without the sustaining aid
of divine grace. Even if it were
practicable, its practicability would,
from its very character, be necessarily
limited to a few rarely gifted minds;
consequently, lacking the generalizing
principles of the truly Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
code, which makes a life of Christian
virtue accessible to all, the lowly
and the great, the rude and
the wise alike, it is assuredly a failure.</p>

<p>She now applied herself with great
assiduity to her children's education.
Not content with imparting the mere
rudimentary portion, she aimed at
giving them a higher and more thorough
course of instruction than most
of our graduating colleges can boast.
It was a bold task for a woman, but
the order of her day at Münster
shows us how little its difficulty could
bend the will or weary the mind of
one who could unswervingly follow
the regulations it contained.</p>

<p>The household rose early every
morning. Some hours were devoted
to study before breakfast, and soon
after the lessons of the day began.
To these she gave six hours daily.
With the exception of classic literature
and German history, for which
she engaged the services of the two
distinguished professors, Kistermaker
and Speiskman, she gave unaided all
the other lessons.</p>

<p>She had competent persons to superintend
the studies of the young
prince and his sister while she was
engaged in her own, but she reserved
the teaching exclusively to herself.
She very often spent entire
nights in preparation for the morrow's
instruction. After the labors of the
day, she always devoted the evenings
to conversation. It was then
she received the visits of Furstenberg
and a number of his literary friends,
among whom was the Abbé Overberg,
with whom she was afterwards
to be so intimately related. Her old
friend Hemsterhuys sometimes made
one of the party, and he was the
only one of her guests at that time
who was not a Catholic.</p>

<p>This was the beginning, the nucleus
of that brilliant literary circle
which, a little later, became so famous
throughout Germany.</p>

<p>Invitations to the literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i>
of the princess soon began to be coveted
as no common honor. The
most distinguished Protestant authors
and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> sought introduction to
that Catholic society, and even infidels
who did not openly scoff at religion
were soon found among its
members. It would have been a
sight of curious interest, standing
aside unseen in that drawing-room
on any evening of their reunions, to
watch that strangely mingled crowd.
The Princess Amelia is evidently the
ruling spirit, and the marks of respect
and homage which her distinguished
visitors pay her on their arrival
tell plainly that her presence
is not the least among the attractions
of that pleasant assembly. Scattered
through the room are men of the
most varied minds and opposite
views. There were many there who
had already acquired literary notoriety
of no mean degree. There were
many more, the history of whose
minds would have been the story of
the anxious doubts and bold speculations
of unbelief which swayed society
in the waning of the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>In the charm of that literary circle,
Jacobi found rest from his restless
scepticism. There Hamann could
quiet his troubled mind. The cold
infidelity of Claude thawed in the
presence of venerable ecclesiastics
and before the influence of their dignity
and learning. Even Goethe himself
confessed that the pleasantest
hours of his life were passed in the
society of the Princess Galitzin. During
three years, these reunions were
a literary celebrity.</p>

<p>Though the princess had not allowed
her mind to be tainted by the
impious philosophy of her time, and
had formed, with the assistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
Hemsterhuys, a better philosophical
system of her own, founded on the
idea of the divinity, yet in all her
views she was completely rationalistic,
rejecting all positive religion.
And she had to confess, too, the defectiveness
of her system in its practical
bearing on her life; for at this
time she complained feelingly, in one
of her letters, that instead of growing
better, according to her idea of
virtue and happiness, she was daily
growing worse.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1783, she fell dangerously
ill. Furstenberg took this
first opportunity to persuade her to
taste of the consolations of religion,
and to try the virtue of the sacraments
of the church. But, though
he actually sent her a confessor, she
declined his services, alleging that
she had not sufficient faith, promising,
however, at the same time, that,
if her life were spared, she would
turn her thoughts seriously to the
subject of religion. It was spared,
and she kept her promise; but it was
a long time before her reflections
took any definite shape or had any
practical result. This was undoubtedly
owing to a want of direction,
and we cannot divine why, among
so many distinguished clerical friends,
one was not found to do her this
kindly office. Yet so it was, and,
most likely, the fault was all her
own.</p>

<p>The time had now come when
her children were of an age to receive
religious instruction; and, this
being a part of the self-imposed task
of their education, she determined
not to shrink from it. But what to
teach them, when she herself knew
nothing, was a most perplexing question.
Hitherto her own researches
only plunged her into a restless uncertainty
of soul which betrayed itself
even in her sleep. Her conscience
would not allow her to impart to her
children her own unbelief, nor yet
permit her to instruct them in a religion
of whose truth she herself was
not convinced. She relieved herself
from this perplexity by deciding not
so much to instruct them in any religion
as to give them a history of
religion in general, abstaining from
any comments that might betray her
own incredulity, or be an obstacle to
the choice she intended they should
subsequently make for themselves.</p>

<p>To fit herself for this task, she commenced
the study of the Bible. This
was the turning-point in her destiny;
she held in her hands, at length, what
was designed to be for her the instrument
of divine grace. Long years ago,
when a child, at the Breslau boarding-school,
it had been remarked that,
when nothing else could curb her
proud and self-willed nature, an appeal
to her affections never failed of
its effect. That tenderness of her
young heart was to be her salvation.</p>

<p>She opened the sacred text to seek
there only dry historic facts, which
she was to note down and relate to
her children. For aught that concerned
herself, the study was undertaken
with a careless, incredulous disinterestedness.
But as she went on
and on through the sacred volume,
and the sublime character of the Almighty
was unfolded before her in
all the beauty and tendernesses of
his mercies, and shining in all the
brightness of his wisdom, her soul
was moved, her heart was deeply
touched; she bowed down before the
omnipotent Creator, and, for the
first time, felt herself a creature.
She read on still; she came to the
Gospel, that record breathing love&mdash;compassionate,
prodigal love&mdash;on
every page, and before its charm
her heart melted, her pride of intellect
faded away, her life came
before her as a useless dream, and
her tears flowed fast upon the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
page; for now she not only felt what
it was to be a creature, but had realized
what it was to be <em>saved</em>.</p>

<p>Her work now became a labor of
love. She not only taught her children,
but she instructed herself. With
her usual intrepidity of intellect, she
was soon acquainted with every mystery
of our holy religion, and with
every duty of the Catholic life. From
the knowledge to the fulfilment of
her duty was always with Amelia an
easy step; consequently, she began
immediately to prepare herself for a
general confession. After a long and
serious examination of her whole life,
she at length made it, on the feast of
St. Augustine, 1786, and, a few days
later, approached the holy communion,
for the first time, with feelings of
deep and tender devotion.</p>

<p>From this moment, a complete
change was wrought in her whole
manner. Her habitual melancholy
gave way to a cheering serenity,
which was as consoling as it was
agreeable and charming to all around
her. Her children and her many
friends were greatly struck with the
visible effects which divine grace
had so evidently produced in her
soul.</p>

<p>She now wished, for her more rapid
advancement in perfection, to place
her conscience entirely under the
direction of the saintly Abbé Overberg.
She was not content to have
him merely as her confessor, but she
wished to enter on the same relations&mdash;to
have the same intimate friendship
with him&mdash;as existed between
St. Vincent de Paul and Mme. de
Gondi, St. Francis de Sales and St.
Jane de Chantal, St. John of the
Cross and St. Teresa. Though she
had written to him several times on
the subject of her direction, yet she
never dared fully to propose her project
to him, lest he might reject her
request altogether. However, she
took courage at last, and, to her
great joy, she was not disappointed.</p>

<p>This holy priest took up his residence
in her palace in 1789, and remained
there, in the capacity of chaplain,
even after her death.</p>

<p>In the following year, Hemsterhuys,
her old friend and preceptor,
died; and in this year, also, the young
Prince Dmitri, having finished an education
which would have fitted him
for any position or profession in life,
took leave of his mother, to commence,
in accordance with the fashion,
his post-educational travels. For
what particular reason he turned his
steps toward the New World does
not appear. It was during the voyage
that he resolved to embrace and
profess the Catholic faith. But Providence
had designed for him more
than a visit to the United States; his
life and his labors in our country have
made the name of Galitzin a familiar
and much-loved word to American
Catholics.</p>

<p>In 1803, the husband of the princess
died suddenly at Brunswick.
This loss she felt most keenly. He
had ever been to her a good and
indulgent husband, yielding, with
even an abundance of good nature,
to all her plans, and never interfering
with the various projects of her life.
We may suppose, too, that her grief
was deepened as his unexpected
death suddenly blighted all her
hopes for his conversion.</p>

<p>But sore trials of another kind yet
awaited her. The property of the
prince, which, by the marriage contract,
should have reverted to her in
trust for her children, was seized by
his relatives. Penury threatened her
for a time, but her appeal was, at
length, heard by the Emperor Alexander,
and the property was restored.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she began to suffer
from a painful malady which produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
hypochondria. The patient,
plaintless manner in which she bore
her pains; above all, the calm of
mind which she preserved in that
terrible physical malady which poisons
every pleasure and clouds every
brightness of life, shows what a high
state of perfection she had already
attained. Religion was now her
solace and her succor. By the perfection
of her resignation to the
divine will, she not only succeeded
in concealing from her friends her
painful state, by joining cheerfully
in every conversation and pastime;
but she cheered the melancholy and
depression of others without once
evincing that she herself was a victim
to its living martyrdom.</p>

<p>With equal fortitude, she was bearing
at the same time yet a harder
trial. It is always wounding enough
to our feelings to have our actions
misappreciated, our whole conduct
misunderstood, by persons merely indifferent
to us. But what is there
harder to endure in life than to be
misunderstood by those to whom we
were once tenderly devoted, to whom
we were bound in the closest friendship
of intimacy, and to bear their
consequent coldness and slights, and
sometimes cruel wrongs? Yet this
pang was added to the other trials
of Princess Amelia. But her great
charity checked every human feeling.
She was never heard to complain of
any neglect, or even the annoying
treatment of false friends, and she
never sought to soothe the sorrow of
her tender heart by any human consolations.
In a letter regarding the
Abbé de Furstenberg, she described
beautifully the rule of charity she
followed in this sorest of her trials.
Whenever the memory of her slighted
friendship would send a pang
through her soul, her love of God
was her first resource; then she resolved
never to intensify the sorrow
of the moment by indulging in any
dreams of the imagination with regard
to an irremediable past, or in
any speculations whatever on the subject
which would strengthen her sorrow
or tend to an uncharitable feeling.</p>

<p>Thus, in these purifying trials, were
passed the last years of her life; and
when, at length, the gold of her merits
was made pure enough in the
crucible to be moulded into her
crown of glory, she rested from her
sorrows.</p>

<p>In 1806, she died the death of the
holy, and, at her own request, she
was buried beneath the chapel of her
country-house at Angelmodde, near
Münster.</p>

<p>Were we right in saying that her
life displays the struggle of a great
soul for its own level above disadvantageous
circumstances? She
struggled above the sad defects of
early training, then above the commonplace
routine of ordinary lives
in the world, and finally above the
clouds of infidelity and ignorance of
divine things, to the bright, clear atmosphere
of the faith, where the love
of her ardent heart was sated, and
her yearning aspirations found their
lasting rest.</p>

<p>It may be, too, that we now have
an easier clue to the wonderful character
of the Apostle of Western
Pennsylvania since we have become
better acquainted with the <i>mother of
Prince Galitzin</i>.</p>

<h2>EGBERT STANWAY.</h2>


<p>If Germany was the cradle of the
Reformation, England can claim to
have been its nurse, and to have fostered
in it many phases even at
present unknown to the land of its
originators. In its last-born and perhaps
most dangerous outgrowth,
Ritualism, we see the English spirit
that was already timidly visible long
before, now fully flowering in delusive
self-existence, uniting in this novel
combination the cherished independence
of Rome, that Englishmen
are taught instinctively to regard as
the only palladium of national freedom,
and those æsthetic aspirations
which come down to them, we venture
to think, as instinctively, from
their forefathers of "Merrie England"
and the "Island of Saints."</p>

<p>But if there are in the English
character great capabilities for evolving
unthought-of theories out of
stern dogmatic codes, there is also
a strange power of assimilation by
which it can engraft upon itself the
alien modes of thought of other lands,
and yet infuse into them something
that is not their own&mdash;something that
renders them unspeakably more attractive
and, withal, more hopelessly
earnest.</p>

<p>Such a power was most likely to
have been encouraged and developed
in Egbert Stanway by his almost
foreign education and most sensitive
and contemplative nature. The love
of German philosophy and German
literature had descended to him from
his father, who had been a disciple
and a friend of Goethe, and who had
early sent him to the university at
Heidelberg, where the boy still was
at his father's death. The weird old
city, with its castle overlooking the
rushing Neckar, and its antique houses
enshrined by woods of chestnut, was
the earliest home he could remember,
and as, during his holidays from the
school where he had been preparing
for university initiation, he had never
left Germany, it was almost as a foreigner
and a stranger that he visited
Stanway Hall to attend his father's
funeral.</p>

<p>The evening he arrived, the gloom
of the old house, and the long shadows
creeping round it, the hooting
owl in the dark fir plantations, and
the grim and spreading cedars nearly
touching the hall-door, everything
he saw, in fact, seemed to make
a most painful impression on his sensitive
mind. The old servants crowded
round him in affectionate and
mournful welcome, for they remembered
the little fair-haired child that
used to prattle so merrily through the
house many years ago, and they
thought they saw in his face the
same expression that had melted their
hearts within them as they had gazed
on the child's dead mother the
night he was born. One of his guardians,
a cousin of his father's, a kind,
grave man, with grizzling hair and
soldier-like bearing, came and took
his hand in silence, and led him to
the low, wide dining-room where the
coffin lay under its heavy velvet pall.
There, in the gloom that the few tall
candles near the bier could hardly
brighten, he told the son how his father
had fallen from his horse while
returning at night from a distant farm
where he had been to see the sick
tenant, and relieve him from the rent
that was due and which his family<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
could not meet. Egbert's face glowed
as he lifted it from the coffin
against which he had been resting
his forehead, and as he said in faltering
accents:</p>

<p>"So like him! I am glad he died
like that."</p>

<p>The words were simple, but the
old soldier could not refrain from the
tears that his own narrative had not
yet forced from him. The child's
comment unlocked his heart, and after
a few moments' silence he said:</p>

<p>"My boy, you will try to live like
him, and try to do your duty like
him. You know you will soon have
power in your hands: use it as he
did. In a few years you will be your
own master; even now you are master
of this house and this estate.
Never forget the responsibilities you
will have. Always be kind to your
servants, and just to your tenants,
and charitable to the poor. Be loved
as your father was, so that, when you
die, you may be regretted as he is."</p>

<p>Egbert pressed his guardian's hand
in silence, and presently knelt down
by the coffin. There was a wreath
of cypress on it, and he broke off
a little twig and hid it in his bosom.
His lips seemed to move&mdash;was he
praying, or thinking half aloud? The
old man's hand was on his shoulder,
and he felt its pressure weighing him
down. When he stood up again, he
said nothing, only motioned his guardian
to the door, and followed him.
There were a few relations, mostly
men, gathered before the fire in the
drawing-room, and as the boy came
in there was a general welcome of
silent sympathy, and then a pause.
Some few spoke in whispers, but the
gloom was too deep to be broken.
There seemed in the dead man's son
more dignity and manliness than is
usual, even under such circumstances,
in one so young, and there was deference
and surprise as well as pity
in the looks that were bent on the
boy of sixteen, to whom nearly all
were strangers, and to whom his own
home and his own household were
themselves but new and strange associations.</p>

<p>As night came on, every one disappeared
noiselessly from the room,
Egbert himself having left it at an
earlier hour. He had gone out into
the summer moonlight to roam
through the grounds he scarcely remembered,
and to be alone with his
own thoughts that would not let him
sleep. The tall formal evergreens
that skirted the broad terrace threw
their shadows across the many flights
of ornamental steps leading to the
flower-garden; the scent of the heliotrope
and mignonnette in the borders
was wafted on the cool breeze that
came from the sedge-encircled pond
where the water-fowl played and hid
in the rushes; the smooth-stemmed
beeches stood like columns of silver
in the moonlight, supporting their
vaulted arches of interlacing leaves;
the rooks cawed solemnly from their
restless homes as the soft wind blew
the branches backward and forward
across the mossy mound; squirrels
made cracking noises as they chattered
in careless gaiety on the slender
twigs of the spruce-fir; and hares and
rabbits scudded away with terror-impelled
swiftness as they heard human
footfalls on the dewy grass.</p>

<p>The tall church-spire seemed to
speak when the bell tolled out the
hours through the night, and Egbert
gazed longingly toward it, not as one
who answers a well-known voice, but
rather as one who strives painfully to
guess the meaning of words he would
gladly understand and yet cannot
fathom.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he thought, "my father
knows now all <em>I</em> wish to know; but
he cannot come and tell me, and I
shall have to live on, perhaps as long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
as he did, and never know what I
seek, and never find the satisfaction
and peace I look for. If <em>I</em> too could
die, and know all at once!"</p>

<p>He thought, too, of the ceremony
that would take place in that church
to-morrow, and of the cold, damp
vault his father's body would be laid
in. And so great was the horror of
this to his mind that the beauty of
the night turned to hideousness for
him, and its wooing sounds were
changed into ghoul-like beckoning.
Tears would not come to relieve his
heart, and he felt as if an icy grasp
were upon him, crushing out his
young life, his father, he could only
think of as he was, mute and helpless,
not as he once had been, a true
guide and monitor; his home, where
was it? his duty, to what dreary
fields of thankless labor might it not
carry him? his friends, who were
they? friends of yesterday? friends
of the family, perhaps, but that was
conventional friendship to him&mdash;or
friends to him as the young landlord,
but that was interested friendship!</p>

<p>And then came back a rush of
Heidelberg memories, of the reckless
young companions of his scarce-begun
career, of the kind old professor,
Herr Lebnach, and of his child-daughter
Christina, of rambles among the
chestnut woods, when the band had
done playing in the castle gardens,
and of two or three darker and more
solemn rambles when he had gone
to follow a dead comrade to his self-made
grave.</p>

<p>The chill morning dew roused him
at last, just when a faint-breaking
light was to be seen over the fir-planted
hill behind the house, and
he went in and threw himself, all
dressed, on his bed in the dim
haunted-looking room he remembered
as his nursery in days so long
past that he could remember nothing
else of them. The sun rose and gilded
the many-hued flower-garden,
and lighted red fires in the diamond-paned
windows on the east side of
the house, and sent long arrows of
light into the tapestried and wainscoted
chambers where the guests
slept; it took the church-steeple by
storm, and poured in floods of molten
gold through the stained-glass
windows of chancel and clerestory;
it flashed through the dark beech
grove, and blinded the uneasy rooks
whom it roused to a new and jangling
chorus; it threw rosy sparks
across the pond, on the margin of
which floated the water-lily and nestled
the forget-me-not; and, lastly, it
penetrated the sombre curtains of the
darkened dining-room, and, braving
death on his throne, threw a coronal
of light on the very cypress wreath
on the bier. And had it not a royal
right, nay, a God-given mission, so to
do? For the morning of the resurrection
is ever near, and each morning's
sun is its fit representative and
the forerunner of its joy.</p>

<p>The same consoling ray that would
not leave the dead alone in death's
own shadow shone on the boy's fair
curls as he bent, half in sorrow, half
in slumber, over the hidden coffin.
Soon, very soon, that coffin would
not be there in the dear sunshine. It
would be away in the darksome earth,
in a lonely vault, with no one save
the bats to make any moan over it,
and, if ever the sun's darts made their
way to it through low, grated air-holes
or widening cracks in the
stone, they would be pale and spectral
themselves, like torches in a deadly
atmosphere, like phantom lights
over the quaking bog.</p>

<p>The hours wore on, and the time
came for the funeral. Again there
was a gathering together of friends
and relatives, and a marshalling of
tenants and servants, a whispering
among the awed assemblage, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
boy asked once to have the pall lifted
and the lid removed. In silence
it was done, and in silence Egbert
Stanway came near, and laid his right
hand on his father's cold, calm forehead.
His lips seemed to move, and
a deeper expression of mingled sorrow
and resolution settled upon his
features; and thus, without a tear, he
took leave of the best friend and best
lover he had ever had on earth. He
seemed much quieter after this, and
the funeral procession now started
on its way to the church, Egbert
walking next the coffin as chief
mourner.</p>

<p>The next day, he was far on his
road to Heidelberg.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Four years passed by. Egbert
Stanway was high in honors at the
university, renowned among the reading
set as an indefatigable scholar,
beloved by his favorite professor,
Herr Lebnach, and his no longer
child-daughter, courted by all the
best men, and respected by all the
worst, in the old city of Heidelberg.
Having resolutely set his face against
duelling and all kinds of brawls, and
even against all innocent-seeming
meetings that, nevertheless, were likely
to end in brawls, he had yet not
acquired the unenviable notoriety of
a misanthrope, and, though many
called him proud, still none called
him churlish. Herr Lebnach used
often to gather a few real friends about
him, and there was generally some
musical banquet provided for his delicate
and discriminating guests.</p>

<p>His room was one of those that
are dreamt of, but seldom seen, homely
and artistic at once, quaint and
suggestive as one of the mysterious
dens of those sages whom modern
times have called sorcerers and tamperers
with arts forbidden. There
stood on one side a great oak book-case,
massive and plain, filled with
huge folios, and smaller books laid
carelessly across their dust-covered
edges, old tomes that looked black
enough for magic, though they might
contain nothing more than medical
lore and visionaries' dreams; over
the carved mantelpiece, where a dark
stove hid itself in the wide space it
could not fill, was an array of pipes,
meerschaum silver-mounted, and
rare wood cunningly wrought; pipes
of tarnished Eastern splendor, and
calumets of Indian workmanship; a
real old spinning-wheel, where Gretchen
might have sat as she sang of her
demon-lover Faustus, stood in one
corner, and a collection of antique
armor hung on all the spaces on the
wall that were not occupied by medical
portraits and angel-crowded
tryptichs in twisted golden frames.
Here, in one oak-carved case,
was Venetian ruby glass and old
Dresden ware, and there, on the
quaint low tables, lay illuminated
missals of the thirteenth century,
alongside of dainty woman's embroidery-frames,
and the last new pamphlet
on the last new philosophical incomprehensibility.
Then, as the dim
light of the lamp flashed when some
motion was made near the long table
by the stove, there appeared on the
other side of the room a great organ,
with golden pipes and carved case&mdash;a
world within a world, the kingdom of
music enshrined within the surrounding
kingdom of science and of literature.
The treble manual, with its tiers
of smooth white notes sheathing the
melodies a moment's touch might set
free, shone under the golden arbor of
the spreading pipes, and beneath the
dark carved garlands of oak-leaves
and hanging fruit and sporting beasts,
that seemed only as petrified embodiments
of the thoughts that had once
been living and breathing in those
keys.</p>

<p>A girl sat by the organ, her hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
seeming to have caught the golden
reflection of the music-laden pipes,
and her slender fingers the litheness
of those easily-moulded keys. Beside
her was a large basket, where
balls of wool mingled with half-finished
garments of domestic mystery,
while in her own hands she held
a piece of knitting. A kitten played
at her feet, and now and then tangled
the long thread that fell from her
work. Egbert Stanway sat quite
close, one hand resting on the organ-notes,
reading aloud by the dark
light of one little candle in the fixed
organ candlestick.</p>

<p>A few men began to drop in, but
the reading was not interrupted, for
the room was large, and the professor
was sitting not far from the door.
Some came in with rolls of white
music; some with instruments tenderly
imprisoned in warmly-lined
cases; some, again, with their hands
unoccupied, but their large pockets
bursting with the treasures of meerschaum
and tobacco; some thoughtful,
student-like, long-haired; some
gay and rubicund, as if dinner were
but a late and cherished memory;
some young and uneasily conscious
of the stranger by the organ. Presently
one came in who was neither
student nor professor, but long-haired
and quaint-looking nevertheless, with
iron-gray locks, straight and wiry,
strongly-marked features, tall, spare
figure, and almost kingly demeanor,
so mixed was it of haughtiness and
courtesy.</p>

<p>Christina rose and signed to her
companion to close the book. She
went forward, and said a few words
of blushing welcome to the royal
stranger, and then turned to Egbert,
saying:</p>

<p>"<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein herr</i>, this is my father's
young friend who was so anxious to
know you."</p>

<p>He put out his hand with kind
eagerness, and, as he did so, Egbert
noticed the long, slender, nervous
fingers, like iron sheathed in age-tinted
ivory.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you, Herr
Stanway," he said, "and very glad to
see you here, for I have no better
friend than Christina's father."</p>

<p>The girl fell back as he spoke, and
passed through the room, speaking,
now and then, to the bearded guests,
who all smiled at her like the Flemish
saints in the old pictures of the Maiden-mother
and her mystic court; and
made her way to an inner apartment
where a grand piano occupied most of
the space, and round the walls of which
were many brackets with bronze and
marble busts of sages and poets, philosophers
and musicians, gleaming out,
ghost like, against the heavy crimson
draperies that fell round window and
doorway.</p>

<p>The stranger was still talking to
Egbert in German when the sounds
of tuning instruments in the next room
drew his attention. He took the young
man's arm, and hurried in, casting a
glance over the sheets of music scattered
on the piano. A flush of pleasure
and surprise came over his countenance;
they were headed, "Overture&mdash;St.
Elizabeth." Egbert looked
across to Christina, but she was busying
herself with a refractory violoncello-case,
whose huge fastenings would
not open, and whether or no she saw
the maestro's puzzled air remained a
mystery both to the young man and
to his companion, whose glance had
followed his own, as if half-guessing
what it meant.</p>

<p>Herr Lebnach struck his friend on
the shoulder as he approached the
wondering musician.</p>

<p>"You must forgive my boldness,"
he said; "in fact, I can only call it
smuggling. I got a copy from a
pupil of yours&mdash;one whose enthusiasm
was stronger than his sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
obedience; but, of course, this is all
among friends-it shall go no further.
Indeed, if you wish it, I will burn the
manuscript after the performance."</p>

<p>"No, no, dear friend," returned
the composer; "it will be publicly
performed and given to the world in
a month or two, and I am glad you
should have the first-fruits."</p>

<p>The amateur orchestra was in a
state of nervous delight at these
words, and as the maestro took the
baton in his hand there was a hush
that said far more than words could
have embodied. Christina and her
father and Egbert sat aloof near the
doorway, and a few others gathered
in silent groups round the room.
The music came forth, at last, like
the rush of an elfin cavalcade out of
darksome caverns and cloven rocks
of unimagined depth, wild and weird,
like the cry of the storm-tossed sea-gulls
among the reverberating crags
of foam-washed granite. It was the
music of delirium, the music of madness,
the music of despair. It was
the voice of a soul that had lost its
way in a labyrinth of dreams so fantastic
that they had thrown a spell
over its returning footsteps, and so
made it for ever an enchanted exile
among their mazy paths. It was unintelligible,
yet full of meaning; unapproachable,
yet full of allurement;
impregnable, yet full of sympathy.
Later on, in great cities, and before
critical audiences, it was held to be
the music of a maniac, while it lacked
the charm or the interest of Shakespeare's
maniac-heroes and their too-faithful
rhapsodies; and even now,
though the performance was a labor
of love, it was not without difficulty
that many phrases were interpreted.</p>

<p>Christina seemed to think more of
the composer than of his work, and
more of his pleasure in seeing his
music appreciated than of his actual
skill in composition. Indeed, her
father and Egbert shared her feelings,
as was apparent from their careful
watching of the conductor's face
rather than of the performers' bows.
But when the long piece was over,
and every one started forward to congratulate
and be congratulated, there
was a general appearance of satisfaction
at having mastered something
that was no little difficulty, and offered
such a grateful and acceptable
homage to one whose heart seemed
to value it so highly. Soon there
was a hush again, and Christina
glided to the piano, where the maestro
was now sitting.</p>

<p>"You will not refuse to reward us
now, will you?" she said.</p>

<p>A smile and a soft chord were the
speedy answer; and now the piano
spoke and wailed, pleaded and wept,
as the strong, supple fingers swept its
astonished keys. It seemed as if
there were within it an imprisoned
and hitherto dumb spirit, whose
voice was now unshrouded and allowed
full power over the hearts of
those who had scarcely before suspected
its hidden existence. Far
different from the tempestuous overture
was this soft and swift blending
of chords in garlands of sweet sound.
Flowers were dropping around the
feet of the artist; clouds of faintly-suggested
and dream-like fancies
were fanning the air around his
head; a spell, as of Eastern languor,
was slowly deadening the
senses of the listeners to any other
sound save that of the marvellous
melody the piano was sighing forth,
when, with a wild toss of the head
and a sudden bending forward of the
body, the maestro changed the key,
and burst into a half-triumphant,
half-defiant pæan&mdash;a chant of patriotic
and maddened enthusiasm&mdash;which
soon merged into the last
movement of his impromptu and the
last appeal of every Christian to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
God that made him; a solemn, dirge-like
hymn, full of unspoken sadness,
full of expressed confidence, a lifting
up of the soul above everything of
earth, a consecration, a supplication,
a thanksgiving, and a sacrifice.</p>

<p>Never before had Egbert heard
anything like that prayer; never
after was he destined to hear it
again.</p>

<p>Christina drew a long sigh, as if
such beauty were too heavenly to be
gazed upon without pain, and turning
to the young man:</p>

<p>"I am glad," she said, "I cannot
play the piano. One could not dare
to touch the instrument after that, unless
it were to destroy it!"</p>

<p>"You are right," he answered
slowly and musingly; "but where
can he have learnt the things he
puts into his music?"</p>

<p>"In his prayers, Herr Stanway."</p>

<p>A dark shade of melancholy passed
over Egbert's face; there was pain
at the implied rebuke, and a vague
sorrow, as for something lost, in that
fugitive expression, but the music
chased it away as the violins were
tuning up again for Beethoven's
"Septet."</p>

<p>So the evening wore away, and chorus
and concerted piece followed fast
upon one another, till the musicians
were so excited they could hardly
speak. The maestro conducted all
through, and as he shook his hair
like a mane about his eyes and
swayed to and fro in the intensity
of his enthusiasm, Egbert whispered
to Christina:</p>

<p>"He is the magician of music, is
he not?"</p>

<p>When all was over, and some of
the guests had left in singing groups
that would probably serenade the
town for the rest of the night, the
great artist called the young Englishman,
and asked him to show him the
way home.</p>

<p>"I am somewhat of a stranger
here, my friend, and there is no one
whose company I would more gladly
ask under the pretence of wanting a
guide home."</p>

<p>As soon as they were out of the
house, he turned suddenly on his
companion, and, lingering so as to
stay for a few moments in the full
moonlight, he said:</p>

<p>"And so you are the betrothed of
my old friend's daughter?"</p>

<p>A start and a blush that he could
not repress were Egbert's first answers
to this abrupt but not unkind
question, yet the old man saw that
his arrow had perhaps overshot the
mark.</p>

<p>"Is it not so?" he said again, but
doubtfully now.</p>

<p>"No, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein herr</i>," replied Egbert,
with slow and sorrowful composure;
"and I fear it never will be."</p>

<p>"You fear, dear friend? Therefore
you hope?"</p>

<p>"I <em>have</em> hoped, but I see now how
useless it must ever be for me to
think of her except as a friend."</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you that
<em>her</em> own favor could not do?"</p>

<p>"I have never asked her for anything,
and I never shall, and it suffices
that she knows as well as I do
what the reason of my silence is."</p>

<p>"Then she does know that you
love her?"</p>

<p>"She knows it as the angels do&mdash;if
there be angels!"</p>

<p>"If! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Only this, that, if there are angels,
they are not more remote from me
than she is."</p>

<p>"You speak in riddles. I have
no wish to force your confidence, my
friend; but I have known that child
from her cradle, and I cannot help
being interested in anything concerning
her."</p>

<p>"O <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein herr</i>! I have nothing to
conceal; you misunderstand me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
She is a Catholic; that is why she is
so far from me."</p>

<p>"And you are a Protestant? But
so is her father."</p>

<p>"No, I am not a Protestant, though
I am English."</p>

<p>"Ah! perhaps you have no settled
outward form of religion?"</p>

<p>"That is it. But, if I <em>were</em> Protestant,
she would not marry me."</p>

<p>"In a few years, dear young
friend, you may think differently. I
was very like you once, only far
worse; yet, you see, I too am a Catholic
now."</p>

<p>The young man shook his head in
silence. They had journeyed through
the dark winding streets very near to
the maestro's temporary home, and
the old artist turned now solemnly
and affectionately to his companion,
putting his hand on his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Herr Stanway," he said, "I may
never see you again, and you must
forgive an old man for speaking so
plainly to you; but I cannot bear to
leave Heidelberg, where your friends
and mine have made me so happy,
without trying to do something
towards <em>your</em> happiness, and, I am
sure, towards <em>hers</em>. Do not, for
Heaven's sake, give way to those
foolish and yet wrecking tendencies
of the young men of your day.
Stand by religion, for I tell you by
experience she is the best philosopher,
as well as the best comforter;
she is the only friend for the student,
as well as for the priest; and, above
all, she is the only guardian for the
home, and the only giver of true
peace. Remember that as an old
man's advice, and, if you trust to the
word of one who has run the round
of all pleasures without finding true
ones till very late, you will save yourself
the long struggle of experience
that wears the body and sears the
mind, and leaves you in your old age
but a shattered wreck to carry back
to the feet of him who sent you forth
a perfect man. Will you remember
this, dear young friend?"</p>

<p>"I will try to do so," Egbert answered
slowly, with intense but hopeless
yearning to be able to do so.
He kissed the hand of the old man
whose words seemed to him but a
mortal record of that other one written
in notes of fire on the awakened
instrument at Christina's home, and
the artist took him in his arms and
embraced him as a son. They parted,
the one to go to his peaceful rest, the
other to turn for consolation and for
calm to the wild woods above the
castle, whence through vistas could
be seen the silver-flashing river, with
here and there its dark semblances
of reversed houses, and spires, and
turrets. "My father! my father!"
thought the young man, "why can
you not tell me what you know&mdash;why
can you not assure me of all I long to
believe, yet cannot? <em>She</em> has often
said that the dead are all of her
faith when they reach God's throne,
and that they believe in it even more
firmly, if possible, than those of her
creed do on earth&mdash;because to them
evidence has been given. Perhaps
to some the evidence is eternal fire&mdash;if
that exist! But surely, he who
made this earth so fair, he who gave us
this solemn night-beauty to enjoy,
and a mind fitted to admire it,
he cannot have meant to bind
us to cruel, unyielding formulas.
If one heart feels its love go out to
him in one way, and another in a
different way, why should not both be
as welcome to him as is the varied
beauty of the many different-tinted and
different-scented flowers? Who has
been to God's feet and learned his
secrets, and come back to tell us
with certainty that he loathes one
heart's worship, and accepts another's?
Not till I have such an assurance
will I, or can I, if I would,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
go to Christina, and say, 'I am a
Catholic.'"</p>

<p>And so the specious and seemingly
religious poison worked on and cankered
his heart, notwithstanding the
solemn warning of his new-found
friend, whose voice, he should have
known it, was near akin to that of
the spirit-witness he was but now
invoking.</p>

<p>The night was very lovely, and reminded
him of that one preceding
his father's funeral, when already
wandering dreams of a self-revealed
faith were turning him away from the
belief in a just and personal God.
The Church of England Catechism,
which he had learnt by heart as a
child, the teachings of a zealous
Episcopalian clergyman who had
prepared him for confirmation in
Germany itself, rushed back upon
his memory as he looked on the symbolic
beauty of the dying night; but
in the dawn that already stirred
the birdlings in their nests and shot
pale darts of virgin light across the
purple-blue heaven, he could see no
emblem of truer life coming to his
soul nor any sign of silent joy offering
itself to his weary heart. And
yet the dawn was shining into a little
flower-scented chamber, and striking
a sweeter perfume from the silent
prayer of its occupant than it could
draw even from the fragrant blossoms
of the golden lime and the
starry pendent clusters of flowering
chestnut gathered in the large earthen
vases near the window.</p>

<p>That prayer was for Egbert, but
he could not feel it yet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Night again, summer again, but a
year has passed, and the German
student is now an English landlord.
To-morrow he will assume the duties
of his new position; to-day he received
the first-fruits of its honors.</p>

<p>The customary rejoicings attendant
on a "coming of age" in Old England
had been duly gone through;
there had been banqueting in the
hall, and feasting in the dining-room;
healths had been drunk and speeches
had been made, and every one was
supposed to be in a superlative state
of happiness. Probably every one
was&mdash;that is, according to their kind,
and to their capability of enjoyment.
Egbert alone seemed thoughtful and
preoccupied; his assembled relations
thought him reserved and cold; some
said a foreign education could be no
good to an Englishman, and he would
never be popular in the country;
others thought he would marry
abroad, some said he would turn
Roman Catholic, and the sporting
squires wondered whether he would
ride and would subscribe to the
hunt.</p>

<p>Contrary to the expectation of the
marriageable young ladies of the
neighborhood, there was no ball
included in the programme of the
birthday <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i>, and the guests who
were not staying at the house all
left towards dark, lighted on their
way by the last explosions of the
fantastic fireworks that had been introduced
as a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">finale</i> to the rejoicings.
After dinner, Egbert and his guardian,
the one we alluded to in the
beginning of this tale, sauntered out
on the terrace, talking in a desultory
way about the little incidents of the
day.</p>

<p>"You gave us so little time, my
dear boy," he said presently, "to
make your acquaintance over again,
considering the time you have been
abroad, that I feel almost as a stranger
to you."</p>

<p>"I should not like ever to be a
stranger to <em>you</em>," replied Egbert;
"but I own I felt a shrinking from
coming here at all, much more upon
such an occasion, and to meet such
people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have grown fastidious, I am
afraid."</p>

<p>"I have led a very quiet life for
the last few years, and I feel much
older than I am, and quite different
from all the young people, both men
and girls, I have met to-day; and, to
tell you the truth, I felt shy, so I
delayed coming to the last moment.
But if <em>you</em> will stay when the house
is quiet again, I am sure we shall
understand each other."</p>

<p>"With all my heart, my dear fellow;
your father was my earliest
friend, and I should like his son to
be as my own."</p>

<p>"I am glad you are alone in the
world, Charles, if you will allow me
that cousinly freedom; for I own I
should have been scared at a bevy
of ladies, and probably committed
some dreadful solecism, and have
got myself ostracized for ever."</p>

<p>"Well, well; it will all come in
time, no doubt; and now tell me all
about your life at Heidelberg."</p>

<p>Could Charles Beran have looked
back at that life, and known what was
called back to existence by his careless
question, perhaps he might have
asked it less carelessly, and been less
astonished at the effect it produced.
His cousin grew pale.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," he added hurriedly,
"if there is any painful recollection
I have stirred up without knowing
it, pray forgive me."</p>

<p>"No," answered Egbert slowly,
"I have no <em>painful</em> recollection in
all my life, not even my father's
death (Beran looked at him anxiously);
for nothing has happened to me
without making me sadder and wiser,
that is, teaching me more and more
that I know nothing."</p>

<p>His companion did not answer.
Egbert was getting beyond him, but
he pressed his hand to show him
that, whatever he might mean, he
had one to sympathize with, even if
he could not share, his sorrow. Egbert
understood the wistful, loving
sign of the old man whose happy
disposition most fortunately kept
him ignorant of the paths of gloom
through which he himself was passing,
and went on to tell him, in general
terms, of his outward life and
habits at Heidelberg. He made no
concealment of his intimacy with
the family of his old professor, but
simply and truthfully said that, on
account of her religion, Christina,
he felt sure, could never be his wife.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," interrupted the old
man, "it is better so, and Providence
meant you to marry an English
wife, and think more of your
property and your own country."</p>

<p>Egbert smiled at this innocent
pressing of Providence into the upholding
of a mere actional prejudice;
and said, unconsciously using
the endearing phraseology of his
adopted language:</p>

<p>"I knew you would think so, dear
friend; but do you fancy that, coming
from the feet of an angel, one
would be likely to rush into the
arms of a child of earth?"</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, you have grown
<em>too</em> German by far! Excuse me, but
this will never do for England, you
know."</p>

<p>"I am afraid England will not do
for me," Egbert replied, laughing;
"that is, if England is to mean Englishmen
and Englishwomen.</p>

<p>"Oh! you will think differently
when you have mixed with them a little;
we really must try and cure you."</p>

<p>"Well, you can try, if you like.
Perhaps we had better go in and
begin with the assembled company
around that piano," said the young
man, as he shrugged his shoulders
and pointed to a white-robed girl
attitudinizing before a splendid instrument,
which, I think, could it
have spoken, would have begged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
be delivered from the attacks of unmusical
school-girls on the matrimonial
lookout.</p>

<p>But every one was tired now, even
school-girls and croquet-playing young
gentlemen&mdash;and heir-huntresses, and
heiress-hunters, and diggers after coronets,
and the various other pliers
of unhallowed trades&mdash;so Egbert was
soon left to himself again, which with
him always meant a long night-ramble
in the whispering woods.</p>

<p>The English beauty of his own unknown
possessions was new to him;
it was also sad, for it was associated
with the memory of his father's funeral;
but, because of its very sadness,
it was the less new, the more
familiar. Across the flower-garden,
across the terraced lawn dotted with
rare trees from Rocky Mountain
gorges and California valleys, across
the network of gravel paths, he walked
thoughtfully over to where an
old ruin stood, with its mantle of
ivy, shrouding crumbled wall and
broken buttress, climbing over scutcheon
and carven doorway, and flinging
its tendrils like falling lace across
the tall mullioned windows. This
gray ruin had been a house once,
but now it was disused and had fallen
into decay. Opposite, only parted
from it by a shrubbery, was the
church where Egbert's father was
buried, and to the left stretched a
wide and long quadrangle with walls
of coral-berried yew, and hedges of
trailing rose and honeysuckle within,
enclosing a tract of wild, rank grass,
and little, nestling, creeping flowers
hidden among the tall tufts. In the
centre stood a sun-dial, lichened over
in brown and yellow patches, catching
the moonbeams now, as if it were
a solitary tombstone in a desecrated
graveyard. The long shadows from
church and ruin stretched themselves
across the lonely enclosure; the
sweetbrier gave forth soft perfume
that carried on its breath some remembrance
of the Heidelberg limes
and chestnuts; falling twigs made
a ghost-like rustling in the tall trees
beyond, and the voice of the night
seemed to say to the young man's
heart, "Peace is nigh."</p>

<p>Egbert wandered on till he came
to the sun-dial; he leaned upon it
and looked around. His thoughts
were deep and sad, but something
within him seemed changed&mdash;he
himself knew not what. "Is it my
father's spirit calling me, or Christina's
heart sending me some heavenly
message? Is it that I am going to
die, or to live and know God?"
Such were the flitting thoughts that
sped like restless wanderers through
his mind, and all night through, as
he walked backward and forward in
the yew quadrangle, and then by the
edge of the beech-shadowed pond,
these same thoughts pursued him,
and shaped themselves to his fancy
into the whispering of the ever-quivering
leaves and the trembling of
the unrestful grass.</p>

<p>It was dawn again before he left
the grounds, and he had scarcely
been asleep a few hours when a hasty
message came to him that a poor
woman from the village was asking
for him in great distress, and was
sure he would not refuse to see her.
It seemed that she came to say her
little girl was taken suddenly ill, and
the doctor thought she would not live.
Egbert had specially noticed this little
one, and played with her during the
preceding day, when the school-children
were enjoying their share of
the day's delight; and, without the
slightest hesitation, he followed the
poor mother to her cottage, where he
found a whole nest of children; some
old enough to look sorry and frightened,
some hardly able to do
aught else than crow and laugh
and give trouble to the elder ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
Up-stairs in a poor little garret lay
the sick child, rocked on the knees
of its eldest sister, and looking very
pinched and white and mournful.
A Catholic priest was in the room, and
there were a few rude prints and a
crucifix on the walls. The little one
was very silent, but the mother said
it had asked piteously for the "pretty
gentleman" to bring it some flowers.
Egbert took its hand and stroked its
small, thin face. The child was not
pretty, but it had that patient, confiding
look that always stirs the heart,
that prematurely yet unconsciously
sad expression that is a thousand
times more winning and more touching
than beauty. For this very reason
had Egbert noticed it the day
before, and asked its name and age
with an interest that made all its
companions jealous.</p>

<p>As he bent down to it, it said
something he could not make out,
and turning to the mother for explanation,
"She says, sir," answered the
poor woman, "would you please say
a prayer?" The young man reddened
and looked at the priest. Again the
child spoke. The priest said to Egbert:
"She has a fancy for it. Will
you not say an Our Father for her?"</p>

<p>He had chosen a prayer on which
there could be no controversy, he
thought, and was surprised when
Egbert, instead of the Lord's Prayer,
began a beautiful and impromptu supplication.
For some time he went
on, and the child listened bewildered;
but as he stretched his hand
towards her, and drew her head upon
his arm, she said with a soft, childish
accent, as if recovering from an
unintelligible surprise: "No; say the
Hail Mary."</p>

<p>The priest saw his head suddenly
droop, and his fair hair touch the
child's darker locks; his voice sank,
and sobs came instead of words;
then there was silence.</p>

<p>"Say the Hail Mary," said the
child.</p>

<p>Egbert never raised his head, but
in a broken voice he said the prayer
as the little one directed, and the
Our Father directly after. But the
priest noticed that he said it as Catholics
do, omitting the superadded
words of the Protestant liturgy.</p>

<p>A few moments after, the child's
father came in; he had been sent
for from his work.</p>

<p>It was not long before God counted
another angel in his train, and
the mother one treasure less upon
earth.</p>

<p>Egbert left the cottage with the
priest, promising to send flowers for
the little one's coffin, and to return
to see it one more in the evening.</p>

<p>He was silent for some minutes,
his companion watching him in appreciative
sympathy, half-guessing
the truth, and giving thanks to God
for his double accession to his church
in one and the same hour. At last
the young man said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Carey, you were surprised I
knew your prayers?"</p>

<p>"I own I was, Mr. Stanway, but
I was happy to see you did."</p>

<p>"I know more than them, and I
always thought that, could I make
any form of faith my own, it would
be yours."</p>

<p>"And what you saw this morning
has, I think, induced you to do so?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you the truth, Mr.
Carey. Up to this morning I could
not bring myself to any tangible belief;
at this moment, thank God, I
think I may venture to say I am
a Catholic."</p>

<p>"My dear Mr. Stanway, this is
indeed happy news. And see the
instrument God has chosen for your
conversion!"</p>

<p>"I have only one more question
to ask you. I have studied the
Catholic faith a long time; I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
say I have loved it long, and, now
that I feel it to be the faith of my
understanding as well as of my
heart, may I not be received at
once?"</p>

<p>"Of course, if you will only come
to my house, and we will have a
few moments' conversation. I have
no doubt you can be made one of
us before to-night."</p>

<p>The priest's house was a humble
little cottage beyond the village
green, and it had indeed needed all
the Oxford scholar's taste to make
its evangelical poverty the type
rather of voluntary detachment than
of necessary want.</p>

<p>Here, in a modest little room, whose
only ornaments were two or three
Düsseldorf prints and a book-case
of theological and controversial
books uniformly bound, Egbert and
Carey sat down for a short time, that
a few questions might satisfy the latter's
judgment as to the propriety of
at once receiving the new convert.
He rose at last, and pointed to a
temporary confessional that stood in
one corner. Egbert was soon prepared,
and every ceremony was rapidly
performed. The priest could
not help noticing the look of perfect
peace that seemed to be the expression
of the young man's predominant
frame of mind. As he was still fasting,
Egbert pleaded hard to be allowed
to receive communion directly
after baptism, and, after a moment's
hesitation, the request was granted.
He then paid another visit to the
poor cottage where God had wrought
this marvellous change in him, and
reverently kissed the tiny white forehead
of the little angel who had gone
before him. And from that hour,
there was not one in the village that
would not have died for the "dear,
kind gentleman that never said one
hard word to a poor man." That
day was remembered long years after,
when the children of the girl he had
seen nursing her little sick sister followed
his own honored remains to
their last earthly abode, and when
another and a less kind master had
come to reign over Stanway Hall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the great dining-room
where the guests were assembled
for breakfast, conjectures were
rife about the absent host, and laughing
questions were put about his
idleness on his too-romantic morning
wanderings, until Mr. Beran, who
also came in rather late, dispelled
the whole mystery by an explanation
consisting of one word, itself a mystery
to many there present&mdash;business;
and a courteous apology from
Egbert, who hoped his friends would
consider Mr. Beran as his delegate
for the house. A few portly matrons
and unmusical school-girls looked
rather black at this substitution; but
against fate what avails impatience?
and against Beran, what availed
black looks?</p>

<p>But when at luncheon Egbert did
not appear, and when at dinner he
came in with a saddened, grave demeanor,
the discontented ones thought
it really was time to throw up the
game and go to other and more
tempting hunting-grounds. So the
party broke up the next day, and
Egbert and his Cousin Charles were
free again. The old man was soon
made acquainted with what had taken
place, and two days after both he
and the young lord of the hall followed
the little child's funeral to the
Catholic cemetery.</p>

<p>But Egbert's heart was not yet satisfied.
Heidelberg's memories were
with him night and day, and it was
not many weeks before he started
for his German home with his new
English friend as companion. He
had not cared to trust his precious
news to the slender certainty of foreign
posts. He wanted to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
very first glimmering of the expression
he knew it would call forth on
one ever-dreamt-of face, and the
journey was to him a ceaseless preparation
for a joy that would come
suddenly after all.</p>

<p>Leaving Beran at the "Golden
Kranz-Hof," he walked through the
darkling streets, past the silent <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">platz</i>,
up to the old house he knew and
loved so well. He never rang, for
the door was open, and the next moment
he stood in the organ-room.
It was empty&mdash;so was the next apartment.
A fear came over him, and
he covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>Presently the door opened, and
Herr Lebnach came in, looking aged
and haggard. There was no surprise
on his face as he saw his pupil and
friend. "I knew thou wouldst come,"
he said simply.</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;" began Egbert, fearing
to shape his dread in words.</p>

<p>"No; come to her. She has asked
for thee. Didst thou not get my letter?"</p>

<p>"Letter! No, I came of my own
accord."</p>

<p>"God be thanked! she will be <em>so</em>
happy!"</p>

<p>And this was his welcome! this
the home he had been journeying to!
Christina was lying in a small iron
bed by the window, a vase of golden-lime
blossoms on the table near her,
and a prayer-book beside it. Her
hands were clasped carelessly on her
knees, and her head propped up very
high with pillows. Egbert took her
white, cold fingers in his, and knelt
down by the bed. She only said his
name&mdash;it was the first time she had
ever done so.</p>

<p>"Christina," he said at length, "I
came to tell you something. Your
faith is mine now."</p>

<p>A faint cry, and a pale, momentary
flush, and then a long look in silence.</p>

<p>"My God, I thank thee! My
prayer is answered!" So she spoke
after a few minutes.</p>

<p>"And I came to ask you something
also," continued Egbert. "Do
you love me as I always hoped you
did?"</p>

<p>"Egbert," she answered solemnly,
"I loved you from the first time I
saw you; but, when I found you did
not love and know the dear God,
I offered my life to him for your
conversion, and he has answered
me."</p>

<p>Egbert told her briefly the circumstances
that had occurred. A few
days passed, and one evening, when
the red sunset was firing the casement,
and her father, her lover, and
Charles Beran, were around her, she
suddenly said, taking the two former
by the hand:</p>

<p>"God is calling me&mdash;do not forget
me. Your blessing, dearest father!
O Egbert!"</p>

<p>And so died Egbert's first and only
love.</p>

<p>Strangers often asked, when they
came to see the beautiful Catholic
Church adjoining Stanway Hall why
it was dedicated to the virgin martyr
St. Christina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>


<h2>THE SCEPTICISM OF THE AGE.</h2>


<p>The strong current of scepticism
which set in during the eighteenth
century extends into the nineteenth.
Among the lower strata of society,
among the dwellings of the poor&mdash;long
the last refuge of religion&mdash;and
especially among the factories and
workshops, this scepticism has made
various inroads on the ancient foundations
of faith. By the sulphurous
glare of the ominous flashes which
momentarily relieve the clouded European
horizon, we often catch glimpses
of the horrors that are steadily accumulating
in the lowest social depths.
A powerful Christian current, whose
volume has as usual increased with
persecution, runs evidently by the
side of this scepticism, but the latter,
nevertheless, preponderates, and it is
therefore not surprising that the barometric
mean of our civilization
should be such a low one.</p>

<p>The frivolous scepticism of the
Voltairean school, now almost extinct
in the French army, still survives
among a majority of the political and
military leaders of the other Latin
nations, as, for instance, in Spain and
Piedmont. For this reason the noble
Spanish people, in spite of their hereditary
virtues and high spirit, are still
accursed with mediocre party leaders,
while statesmen like the pious
and chivalrous Valdegamas are only
too rare. In Piedmont, unbelief,
leagued with Italian cunning and rapacity,
has during the last years
borne blossoms which may well make
us blush for our boasted civilization.
"The proclamation of Cialdini and
Pinelli" (one of which calls the Pope
a clerical vampire and vicegerent of
Satan), observed Nicotera, speaking in
the National Assembly of the conduct
of these generals in Naples and
Sicily, "would disgrace a Gengis-Khan
and an Attila!" "Such acts,"
exclaimed Aversano, alluding to the
same subject in the Italian Parliament,
"must disgrace the whole nation in
the eyes of the world!" "It is literally
true," said Lapena, President of
the Assizes at Santa Maria, "that in
this second half of the nineteenth
century a horde of cannibals exists in
our beautiful Italy!"</p>

<p>Other nations may perhaps thank
God with the Pharisee in Scripture
that they are not like the Italians. But
if they have not gone to the length
of fusillading defenceless priests (the
case of Gennaro d'Orso, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gazette du
Midi</i>, February 1, 1861)&mdash;if they have
never trodden under foot the crucifix&mdash;if
their mercenaries have never
raised blasphemous hands against
the consecrated Host (<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Giornale di
Roma</i>, January 24, 1861)&mdash;in short,
if other European nations have not
yet been guilty of such atrocities as
the Italians, very few have much
cause to pride themselves upon their
godliness and piety. Even in Germany,
the fanaticism of infidelity has
brought men close to the boundary-line
which divides a false civilization
from barbarism, and in some cases this
line has already been crossed. At
Mannheim the cry, "Kill the priests,
and throw them into the Rhine!" was
raised in 1865. In many parts of
Southern Germany, the members of
certain religious orders have been
grossly ill-treated by an ignorant and
brutal populace. "It is but too true,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
says the Archbishop of Freiburg, in
his pastoral of May 7, 1868, "that
the servants of the church are often
exposed to insult and violence."</p>

<p>Ascending from the levels of ordinary
life into the higher regions of
civilization, science, and art, we discover
that the scepticism of the last
century has made more progress
among our philosophers and poets.
It is especially among the former
that this scepticism seems to have
gained ground, for materialism ranks
lower in the scale of intelligence than
the deification of the human mind.
This return to the atomic theory of
Epicurus is calculated rather to stupefy
than to enlighten, for Humboldt
remarks that a multiplicity of elementary
principles is not to be met
with even among the savages. Materialism
is utterly incapable of elevating
the heart, and destroys therefore
a branch of civilization quite as
essential as intellectual culture itself.
Where all this tends to, how it brutalizes
man and degrades him below
the animal, how it obliterates every
distinction between good and evil,
how it robs our accountability of all
meaning, how it makes the savage
state with its attendant ignorance
and barbarism our normal condition,
has been forcibly pointed out in
Haeffner's admirable treatise on <cite>The
Results of Materialism</cite>. "The materialist,"
says Haeffner, "virtually tells
man: You are wrong to set yourself
in aristocratic pride over the other
brutes; you are wrong to claim descent
from a nobler race than the
myriads of worms and grains of sand
that lie at your feet; you are wrong
to build your dwelling above the stalls
of the animals: descend, therefore,
from your grand height, and embrace
the cattle in the fields, greet the trees
and grasses as equals, and extend your
hand in fellowship to the dust whose
kindred you are."</p>

<p>As in modern philosophy, so the
scepticism of the preceding century
is equally manifest in modern poetry.
"No department of human activity,"
observes a profound thinker of the
present day, "is so feeble and occupies
so low a moral standpoint as
poetry, through which all the demoralization
of the eighteenth century
has been transmitted." It is a sort
of confessional, from which we publish
to the world our own effeminacy
and degradation&mdash;not to regret and
repent, but to defend and make parade
of them. What we feel ashamed
to say in simple prose, we proclaim
boldly and complacently in
rhyme. If a poet soars now and
then to virtue, it is generally only
virtue in the ancient heathen sense.
Hence it comes that, when a political
storm impends in the sultry atmosphere
of the Old World, the night-birds
and owls of anarchy fill the
air with their cries. In times of
peace they luxuriate in our modern
political economism with the law of
demand and supply, by whose agency
human labor has been reduced to
a mere commodity. In literature
they preach the evangel of materialism
under the flimsy guise of so-called
popularized science, and even the
school has been perverted into an
institution whose sole object seems
to be to supply labor for the white
slave mart.</p>

<p>Those who desire to behold the
fruits which spring from this unchristian
culture of material interests
should go to England for an illustration.
Though the Anglican sect is the
state religion, infidelity has made nowhere
greater progress than in that
country. Its principal church, St.
Paul's, London, gives no evidences
of Christianity. The interior does
not address itself like Paul to the
Areopagus, but like the Areopagus
to Paul, for it inculcates an unadulterated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
heathenism. The first monument
that arrests the attention of the
visitor is dedicated to the pagan
Fama, who consoles Britannia for the
loss of her heroic sons. The next
monument belongs to the heathen
goddess of Victory, who crowns a
Pasenby; while a Minerva calls the
attention of budding warriors to La
Marchand's death at Salamanca.
Then come a Neptune with open
arms, Egyptian sphinxes, the East
India Company seal. When the
principal religious edifice of a nation
is thus turned into a heathen temple,
the people themselves must become
heathenized, and this we find to be
so here. In Liverpool 40, in Manchester
51, in Lambeth 61, in Sheffield
62 per cent. profess no religion
at all. So says the London <cite>Times</cite>
of May 4, 1860. In the city of
London thousands and tens of thousands
know no more of Christianity
than the veriest pagans. In the parish
of St. Clement Danes, on the
Strand, the rector discovered an irreligiousness
incredible to believe
(<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, April, 1861). For
generations hundreds and thousands
of coal miners have lived in utter ignorance
of such a book as the Bible.
In answer to the question whether
he had ever heard of Jesus Christ,
one of them replied: "No, for I
have never worked in any of his
mines." Innumerable facts attest
that civilization retrogrades in a ratio
with this deplorable religious ignorance.
"Among all the states of
Europe," remarked Fox in the House
of Commons (Feb. 26, 1850), "England
is the one where education has
been most neglected." The justice
of this observation is fully sustained
by the report presented in May of
the same year by the board of school
trustees of Lancashire: "Nearly half
the people of this great nation," say
they, "can neither read nor write,
and a large part of the remainder
possesses only the most indispensable
education." Out of 11,782 children,
5,805 could barely spell, and
only 2,026 could read with fluency.
Out of 14,000 teachers, male and
female, 7,000 were found grossly incompetent
for their positions. Among
the troops sent to the Crimea, no
more than one soldier in every
five was able to write a letter
home.</p>

<p>A glance at a few statistics will
clearly show that moral deterioration
keeps even pace with the intellectual.
From 1810 to 1837, the number of
criminals has annually increased, in
certain districts, from 89 to 3,117;
from 1836 to 1843, the average number
of persons arrested each year in
the manufacturing districts of York
and Lancaster increased over 100
per cent., and the number of murderers
89 per cent.; from 1846 to
1850, the number of criminals in the
Dorset district increased from 726 to
1,300, giving, in a population of
115,000 souls, 1 criminal to every
60 individuals. In London, the number
of persons arrested in 1856
amounted to 73,260, whence it appears
that about 1 inhabitant in
every 40 passes through the hands
of the police. Of the 200,000 criminal
offences tried each year before
the English tribunals, one-tenth part
are committed by children, and
50,000 by persons less than twenty
years of age. In London alone,
17,000 minors are yearly tried,
which is 1 inhabitant in every 175;
whereas the ratio for Paris is only
1 inhabitant in every 400. Mayhew
computes that £42,000 are stolen
during the year in the metropolis;
and the London <cite>Examiner</cite> lately deplored
that there should be less danger
in crossing the great desert than
in passing through some of the more
remote suburbs of London at night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
The story of a Professor Fagin, who
gave private lessons in stealing, has
often been regarded as a canard;
but we read, in the <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>,
an advertisement in which one
Professor Harris announces a similar
course of instruction, and even promises
his pupils to take them, for
practice, to the theatres and other
places of public resort. Among
these startling fruits of British civilization
must be included the 28
cases of polygamy which occurred
in London in a single twelvemonth;
the 12,770 illegitimate children born,
during 1856, in the workhouses alone;
the children market, held openly in a
London street every Wednesday and
Thursday, between the hours of six
and seven, where parents exhibit their
offspring for sale, or hire them out for
infamous purposes. Such being the
condition of an overwhelming majority
of the people, it is no longer difficult
to credit the existence of the
new race which is now said to be
growing up in England&mdash;a race whose
civilization Dr. Shaw contrasts, rather
disparagingly, with that of the African
and the Indian. "After a careful investigation,"
says Dr. Shaw, "I have
been forced to arrive at the conclusion
that, while the moral, physical, intellectual,
and educational status of the
lowest English classes is about on the
same level with that of the savage,
they rank even below him in morals
and customs."</p>

<p>And what has England, politically
considered, done for the cause of
civilization since cotton achieved its
great triumph over corn? As one
of the great powers of the Christian
world, she has virtually abdicated.
For national right and justice, for
really oppressed nationalities, she has
long ceased to upraise her voice or
her arm. It is only when some
Manchester cotton-lord suffers an injury
in his pocket that her fleets
threaten a bombardment. She is an
asylum for the refuse of all nations,
and freely permits the torch of the
incendiary to be cast into the dwellings
of her neighbors. Her literature,
philosophy, religion, as well as
her industry, trade, and diplomacy,
are intended to hand the nations
completely over to materialism.
Wherever England's policy predominates,
there virtue and simplicity,
happiness and peace, disappear from
the earth, and out of the ruins rises
an arrogant and inordinate craving
for the goods of this world. British
influence has destroyed Portugal,
weakened Spain, distracted Italy,
and impaired the moral prestige of
France. Her religious apathy encourages
a degrading heathenism.
Britain's political economy has inaugurated
in Europe not only a serfdom
of labor, but a serfdom of mind.
The Scotchman, Ferguson, predicted
that thought would become a trade,
and Lasalle remarks that it has already
become one in the hands of
most English scholars. And these
are the results of our much-vaunted
civilization!</p>

<p>The pernicious example set by
England in philosophy, poetry, and
letters has unfortunately found but
too many imitators on the Continent
of Europe and elsewhere. Our literature
is at present in the same condition
in which it was in the days of
Sophists and Greek decadence. When
God desires to punish a civilized people&mdash;remarked
some years ago an
eloquent French pulpit orator&mdash;he
visits them with such a swarm of
unbelieving scholars as the clouds
of locusts which he inflicted upon
ancient Egypt. Men of perverse
heads and corrupted hearts generate,
in centuries which are called enlightened,
a darkness upon which the
goddess Genius of Knowledge sheds
uncertain flashes, resembling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
lightning which relieves the evening
sky on the approach of a storm:
The Sophists of ancient Greece were
such heralds of impending wrath and
desolation, and this class of men
closely resemble the majority of our
modern literati. If we compare the
atheistic, material tendencies of a
Protagoras, Antiphon, or Œnopides
with our present progressive science;
if we recall the time when Prodikus
or Critias, in their efforts to destroy
the religion of Greece, represented it
as an invention of selfishness or of
the ancient lawgivers; if Hippias
offered himself to lecture on every
conceivable subject, just as prominent
writers now undertake to discuss all
topics; if the latter again cloak their
designs under the same phraseology;
in short, when all this is once more
re-enacted, then the parallel between
that age and our own will be found
almost perfect. The same class of
scholars flourished in both eras; in
both they claimed to be the high-priests
of truth, although they are no
more entitled to this honor than
those whom Lucian describes leading
the Syrian goddess on asses about
the land. We live, in fact, in the
days of a declining civilization, and
nothing but a speedy return to the
cardinal principles of Christianity
can save us from relapsing into barbarism.</p>

<h2>OUR LADY OF LOURDES.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF HENRI LASSERRE.</p>

<h3>PART VII.<br />

I.</h3>

<p>The clergy still kept away from
the grotto and aloof from all share
in the movement. The orders of
Mgr. Laurence were strictly observed
throughout the diocese.</p>

<p>The people, cruelly harassed by
the persecuting measures of the administration,
turned with anxiety toward
the authority charged by God
with the conduct and defence of the
faithful. They expected to see the
bishop protest energetically against
the violence offered to their religious
liberty. A vain hope! His lordship
kept absolutely silent, and let the prefect
have everything his own way.
Shortly afterward, M. Massy caused
to be circulated in print a report that
he acted according to agreement
with the ecclesiastical authority; then
astonishment became general, for the
bishop did not publish a line in contradiction.</p>

<p>The heart of the people was troubled.</p>

<p>Hitherto the ardent faith of the
multitude had been at a loss to explain
the extreme cautiousness of the
clergy. At the present juncture, after
so many proofs of the reality of
the apparitions, the springing up of
the fountain, and so many cures and
miracles, this excessive reserve of
the bishop during the persecution of
the civil power seemed to them like
a defection. Neither respect for his
private character nor even his office
could restrain the popular murmurs.</p>

<p>Why not pronounce upon the matter,
now that the elements of certainty were
flowing in from all quarters? Why
not, at least, order some inquiry or
examination to guide the faith of all?
Were not events which might suffice
to overthrow the civil power and
raise a sedition worth the attention
of the bishop? Did not the prelate's
silence justify the prefect in
acting as he did? If the apparition
were false, ought not the bishop to
have warned the faithful and nipped
error in the bud? If, on the other
hand, it were true, ought he not to
have set his face against this persecution
of believers, and courageously
defended the work of God against
the malice of men? Would not a
mere sign from the bishop, even an
examination, have stopped the prefect
from entering upon his course of
persecution? Were the priests and
the bishop deaf to all the demands
for recognition which came from the
foot of this rock, ever to be celebrated
as the place where the Mother of
our crucified God had set her virginal
foot? Had the letter succeeded
in killing the spirit, as among the
priests and Pharisees of the Gospel,
so that they were blind to the most
striking miracles? Were they so occupied
with the administration of
church affairs, so absorbed by their
clerical functions, that the almighty
hand of God outside the temple was
for them an affair of little account?
Was this time of miracles and persecution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
a proper season for the bishop
to take the last place, as in processions?</p>

<p>Such was the clamor that arose
and daily swelled from the crowd.
The clergy were accused of indifference
or hostility, the bishop of weakness
and timidity.</p>

<p>Led by events and the natural
bent of the human heart, this vast
movement of men and ideas, so essentially
religious in spirit, threatened
to become opposed to the clergy.
The multitude, so full of faith in the
Trinity and the Blessed Virgin, seemed
about to go where the divine power
was plainly manifest, and to desert
the sanctuary, where, under the priestly
vestment, the weaknesses of men
are too often to be found.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Mgr. Laurence continued
immovable in his attitude of
reserve. What was the reason that
made the prelate resist the popular
voice, so often taken for the voice of
Heaven? Was it divine prudence?
Was it human prudence? Was it
shrewdness? Or was it mere weakness?</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It is not always so easy to believe,
and in spite of the striking proof,
Mgr. Laurence still retained some
doubts, and hesitated to act. His
well-instructed faith was not as quick
as the faith of the simple. God, who
shows himself, so to speak, to souls
who cannot pursue human studies, is
often pleased to impose a long and
patient search upon cultivated and
informed minds who are able to arrive
at truth by the way of labor, examination,
and reflection. Even as
the Apostle St. Thomas refused to
believe the testimony of the disciples
and the holy women, so Mgr.
Laurence desired to see with his own
eyes and touch with his own hands.
Exact, and far more inclined to the
practical than to the ideal, by nature
distrustful of popular exaggeration,
the prelate belonged to that class
who are chilled by the passionate
sentiments of others, and who readily
suspect self-deception in anything
like emotion or enthusiasm. Although
at times he was startled by
such extraordinary events, he so feared
to attribute them rashly to the supernatural
that he might have put
off his acknowledgment of their true
source until it was too late, were it
not that his natural bent had been
well tempered by the grace of God.</p>

<p>Not only did Mgr. Laurence hesitate
to pronounce judgment, but he
could not even make up his mind to
order an official inquiry. As a Catholic
bishop penetrated with the external
dignity of the church, he feared
to compromise it by engaging
prematurely to examine facts of which
he himself had insufficient personal
knowledge, and which, after all, might
have no better foundation than the
dreams of a little peasant and the
illusions of poor fanatical souls.</p>

<p>Of course the bishop never had
counselled the measures taken by
the civil power, and warmly disapproved
them. But, since the wrong
had been committed, was it not prudent
to draw from it an accidental
good? Was it not well&mdash;if, perchance,
there were some error in the popular
stories and belief&mdash;to abandon the
pretended miracle, and allow it to
sustain single-handed the hostile examinations
and persecution of M.
Massy, the free-thinkers, and scientists
leagued together against superstition?
Was it not proper to wait,
and not to hasten a conflict with the
civil power which might prove entirely
unnecessary? The bishop privately
answered after this manner
all who pressed him to interfere:
"I deplore as much as you the measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
which have been taken; but I
have no charge of the police, I have
not been consulted with regard to
their proceedings, what then can I
do? Let everybody answer for his
own acts.... I have had nothing
to do with the action of the
civil power in reference to the grotto;
and I am glad of it. By-and-by
the ecclesiastical authority will see if
it is necessary to move." In this
spirit of prudence and expectation,
the bishop ordered his clergy to
preach calmness and quiet to the
people, and to employ all means to
make them submit to the prohibitions
of the prefect. To avoid all disturbance,
not to create any new difficulties,
and even to favor, out of respect
for the principle of authority, the
measures adopted in the name of
government, and to let events take
their course, seemed to the bishop
by far the wisest plan.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts of Mgr.
Laurence, as is manifest from his correspondence
about this time. Such
were the considerations which determined
his position and inspired his
conduct. Perhaps, if he had possessed
the strong faith of the multitude,
he would have reasoned otherwise.
But it was well that he reasoned
and acted as he did. Because,
if Mgr. Laurence, with the prudence
becoming a bishop, looked
from the standpoint of possible error,
God with infinite wisdom saw the
certainty of his own acts and the
truth of his work. God willed that
his work should undergo the test of
time, and should affirm itself by surmounting
without human aid the
trials of persecution. If the bishop
had from the start believed in the
apparitions and miracles, could he
have refrained from a generous outburst
of apostolic zeal and energetic
interference in behalf of his persecuted
flock? If he really had believed
that the Mother of God had appeared
in his diocese, healing the sick
and demanding a temple in her honor,
could he have balanced against
the will of heaven the pitiful opposition
of a Massy, a Jacomet, or a
Rouland? Certainly not. With
what an ardent faith he would have
set himself with mitred brow and
cross in hand against the civil power,
as St. Ambrose of old met the
emperor at the church-door of Milan!
Openly and at the head of his flock,
he would have gone without fear to
drink at the miraculous fountain, to
kneel in the place sanctified by the
footsteps of the Blessed Virgin, and
to lay the corner-stone of a magnificent
temple in honor of Mary Immaculate.</p>

<p>But in thus defending the work of
God at that time, the prelate would
have infallibly weakened it in the future.
The support which he gave it
at the start would hereafter render it
suspected as emanating from man
and not from God. The more that
the bishop kept aloof from the movement,
the more rebellious or even
hostile he may be showed to have
been to the popular faith, so much
the more clearly is the supernatural
manifested by its triumph, singly and
in virtue of its truth, over the hatred
or neglect of all that bears the name
of power.</p>

<p>Providence resolved that so it
should be, and that the great apparition
of the Blessed Virgin in the
nineteenth century should pass
through trials, as did Christianity,
from its very birth. He wished that universal
faith should commence among
the poor and humble, in the same
way as, in the kingdom of heaven,
the first were last and the last first.
It was then necessary, according to
the divine plan, that the bishop, far
from taking the initiative, should hesitate
the longest, and finally yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
last of all to the irresistible evidence
of facts.</p>

<p>See how, in his secret designs, he
had placed at Tarbes on its episcopal
throne the eminent and reserved man
whose portrait we have just sketched.
See how he had kept Mgr. Laurence
from putting faith in the apparition,
and maintained him in doubt in spite
of the most striking facts. Thus, he
confirmed in the prelate that spirit
of prudence which he had bestowed
upon him, and left to his episcopal
wisdom that character of long hesitation
and extreme mildness which,
in the midst of their excitement, the
people could not comprehend, but
whose providential usefulness and admirable
results the future was about
to manifest to the eyes of all.</p>

<p>The people had the virtue of faith,
but in their ardor they wished to force
the clergy into premature interference.
The bishop possessed the
virtue of prudence, but his eyes were
not yet opened to the supernatural
events which were taking place in
the sight of all. Complete wisdom
and the just measure of all things
were then as ever in the mind of
God alone, who directed them toward
the end and made use both of
the ardor of the people and the prelate.
He willed that his church, represented
by the bishop, should abstain
from taking an active part, and
keep out of the struggle until the
supreme moment, when she was to
step forward as the final arbiter in
the debate and proclaim the truth.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Less calm and less patient than
the bishop by their very nature, and
now carried away by enthusiasm at
sight of the miraculous cures which
took place daily, the people could
not bear themselves so indifferently
toward the measures of the administration.</p>

<p>The more intrepid, braving the tribunals
and their fines, broke through
the barriers, and, flinging their names
to the guards, went to pray before
the grotto. Among these same
guards many shared the faith of the
crowd, and commenced their watch
by kneeling at the entrance to the
venerable spot.</p>

<p>Placed between the morsel of
bread which their humble employment
procured and the repulsive
duty which was demanded by it, these
poor men, in their prayer to the Mother
of the weak and needy, cast all
the responsibility upon the authority
which controlled their acts. Nevertheless,
they strictly fulfilled their
duty and reported all the delinquents.</p>

<p>Although the impetuous zeal of
many believers caused them to expose
themselves willingly in order to
invoke the Blessed Virgin in the
place of her apparition, nevertheless
the jurisprudence of M. Duprat,
whose fine of five francs could be
raised, as we have explained, to enormous
sums, was sufficient to terrify
the great mass. For most of them,
such a condemnation would have
been utter ruin.</p>

<p>And yet a great number endeavored
to escape the rigorous surveillance
of the police. Sometimes the faithful,
respecting the barriers where the
guards were stationed, came to the
grotto by secret paths. One of the
number watched and gave notice of
the approach of the police by an appointed
signal. It was with the utmost
difficulty that the sick could be
transported to the miraculous fountain.
The authorities, being notified
of these infractions, doubled the number
of sentries and intercepted all the
paths.</p>

<p>Still, many swam across the Gave
to kneel before the grotto and drink at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
the holy fountain. Night favored such
infractions, and they multiplied continually
in spite of the vigilance of
the police. The influence of the clergy
was greatly lessened and almost
compromised on account of the reasons
which we have set forth.</p>

<p>In spite of the efforts which they
made to carry out the orders of the
bishop, the priests were powerless
to calm the general agitation or to
cause their flock to respect the arbitrary
measures of the civil power.
"We ought to respect only that
which is respectable," such was the
revolutionary motto which everywhere
found echo. The personal
ascendency of the curé of Lourdes,
who was so universally loved and
venerated, began to give way before
popular irritation.</p>

<p>Order was threatened by the very
means that were taken to maintain it.
The people, wounded in their most
cherished beliefs, wavered between
violence and submission. While on
one hand petitions to the emperor
were signed in all parts demanding
the withdrawal of the orders of the
prefect in the name of liberty of conscience,
on the other hand the planks
which closed the grotto were several
times torn off during the night and
thrown into the Gave. Jacomet
vainly strove to find out these believers,
so wanting in respect for the
civil power as to abandon themselves
without shame to a crime hitherto
unknown to our laws, nocturnal
prayer with trespass and breach of
enclosure.</p>

<p>Sometimes they prostrated themselves
at the stakes which formed the
boundary of the forbidden ground&mdash;a
mute protest against the measures of
the government, and a mute appeal
to Almighty God.</p>

<p>On the day which saw the sentence
of the tribunal of Lourdes set
aside by the court of Pau with reference
to several women who were
prosecuted for innocent conversation
about the grotto, and two others who
were acquitted, then an enormous
crowd gathered around the stakes,
they shouted victory, and passed the
barriers in compact masses without
a word in answer to the cries and efforts
of the police. The latter, disconcerted
by the recent check at
Pau and overpowered by the multitude,
gave way and let the torrent
pass. The following day orders and
remonstrances from the prefect came
to comfort them and to prescribe a
stricter watch. The force was increased.
Threats of dismissal were
bruited by the agent of the government,
and vigilance redoubled.</p>

<p>Sinister reports of imprisonment
absolutely false, but cleverly circulated,
were readily accepted by the
multitude. The real penalties not
being sufficient, it was necessary to
resort to imaginary ones in order to
make a stronger impression on the
souls of the faithful. By such means
they succeeded in hindering for a
time any renewal of the open infractions
of the law.</p>

<p>Occasionally, unfortunate victims
of blindness or palsy from a distance,
who had been abandoned by
the physicians and whose ills God
alone knew how to cure, would come
to the mayor and entreat him with
clasped hands to give their lives one
last chance at the miraculous spring.
The mayor was inflexible, showing
in his execution of the prefect's orders
that energy of detail by which
feeble natures so often deceive themselves.
He refused in the name of
the superior authority the desired
permission.</p>

<p>The greater number then went
along the right bank of the Gave to
a point opposite the grotto. Here
on certain days an immense throng
collected, beyond the reach of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
prefectoral power; for the land belonged
to private parties, who believed
that the benediction of Heaven
would fall upon the footprints of the
pilgrims, and gladly permitted them
to kneel upon their land, and to pray
with eyes turned toward the place of
the apparition and the miraculous
fountain.</p>

<p>About this time, Bernadette fell sick,
affected by her asthma and also fatigued
by the number of visitors who
wished to see and speak with her.
In hopes of quieting souls by removing
every cause of agitation, the
bishop availed himself of this circumstance
to advise Bernadette's parents
to send her to the baths of Cauterets,
which are not far from Lourdes.</p>

<p>It would serve to withdraw her
from those conversations and inquiries
which served to increase
popular emotion. The Soubirous,
alarmed at her state, and observing
the bad effect of these continual
visits, confided Bernadette to one of
her aunts who was about to go to
Cauterets, and who undertook the
care and expenses of her little niece.
The cost of such a visit is considerably
less at that time of the year
than any other, as the baths are almost
deserted. The rich and privileged
come later in the season.
Here, as an invalid seeking repose
and quiet, Bernadette used the waters
for two or three weeks.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>As the month of June draws to a
close, the fashionable watering season
begins in the Pyrenees. Bernadette
returned to her home at Lourdes.
And now, tourists, bathers, travellers,
and scientific men from a thousand
different parts of Europe began to
arrive at the various thermal stations.
The rugged mountains, so wild and
lonely during the rest of the year,
were peopled with a throng of visitors
belonging for the most part to
the higher social class of the great
cities.</p>

<p>By the close of July, the Pyrenees
became suburbs of Paris, London,
Rome, and Berlin.</p>

<p>Frenchmen and foreigners met in
the dining-halls, jostled one another
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i>, rambled among the
mountain-paths, or rode in every direction,
along the streams, over the
ridges, or through the flowery and
shaded valleys.</p>

<p>Ministers worn out by labor, deputies
and senators fatigued by too
much listening or speaking, bankers,
politicians, merchants, ecclesiastics,
magistrates, writers, and people of
the world, all came to provide for
their health, not only at the famous
springs, but in the pure and bracing
mountain air, which gives energy to
the pulse and fills the mind with vigor
and activity.</p>

<p>This motley society represented
all beliefs and disbeliefs, all the
philosophic systems, and all the
opinions under the sun. It was a
microcosm. It was an abridged edition
of Europe&mdash;that Europe which
Providence thus wished to place in
presence of his supernatural works.
Nevertheless, as of old in Bethlehem
he showed himself to the shepherds
before his manifestation to the Magian
kings; so at Lourdes he first
called the humble and the poor to
behold his wonders, and only after
them the princes of wealth, intelligence,
and art.</p>

<p>From Cauterets, from Barèges,
from Luz, from St. Sauveur, strangers
hastened to Lourdes. The city was
filled with rattling coaches, drawn,
according to the custom of the country,
by four powerful horses, whose
harness and trappings are of many
colors and adorned with strings of
little bells. The greater proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
of the pilgrims paid no attention to the
barriers. They braved the law and
went into the grotto, some out of
motives of faith, and others led by
mere curiosity. Bernadette received
innumerable visits. Everybody wished
to see and could see the persons
who had been miraculously cured.
In the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salons</i> at the baths, the
events which we have recounted formed
the universal topic of conversation.
Little by little, public opinion
began to be formed, no longer the
opinion of an insignificant nook at
the foot of the Pyrenees, and extending
only from Bayonne to Toulouse
or Foix, but the opinion of France
and Europe, now represented among
the mountains by visitors of all classes,
of every intellectual shade, and
from every place.</p>

<p>The violent measures of Baron
Massy, which vexed curiosity as much
as piety, were highly censured by
all. Some said that they were illegal,
others that they were misplaced,
but all agreed that they were utterly
inadequate to suppressing the prodigious
movement of which the
grotto and the miraculous spring
were the centre.</p>

<p>The evidences of this total inefficiency
drew upon the prefect severe
criticism from those who shared his
horror of the supernatural, and who
at the start would have loudly applauded
his policy. Men in general,
and free-thinkers in particular,
judge the acts of government rather
by their results than by philosophic
principles.</p>

<p>Success is the most certain means
of winning their approval; failure, a
twofold misfortune, since universal
blame is added to the humiliation of
defeat. M. Massy was subject to
this double mishap.</p>

<p>There were circumstances, however,
which put the zeal of the police
and even the official courage of
M. Jacomet to a rude test. Illustrious
personages violated the enclosure.</p>

<p>What was to be done in such embarrassing
cases?</p>

<p>Once they suddenly halted a stranger,
of strongly marked and powerful
features, who passed the stakes
with the manifest intention of going
to the Massabielle rocks.</p>

<p>"You can't pass here, sir."</p>

<p>"You will soon see whether I can
or cannot pass," answered the stranger,
without for a moment arresting
his progress towards the place of the
apparition.</p>

<p>"Your name? I will enter a
complaint against you."</p>

<p>"My name is Louis Veuillot," replied
the stranger.</p>

<p>While the process was being drawn
up against the celebrated writer, a
lady crossed the limits a short distance
behind him, and went to kneel
before the planks that shut up the
grotto. Through the cracks of the
palisade she watched the bubbling
miraculous spring and prayed. What
was she asking of God? Was her
prayer directed towards the past or
the future? Was it for herself or
others, whose destiny had been confided
to her? Did she ask the
blessing of Heaven for one person
or for a family? Never mind!</p>

<p>This lady did not escape the
watchful eyes of him who represented
at once the prefectoral policy, the
magistracy, and the police.</p>

<p>Argus quitted M. Veuillot, and
rushed towards the kneeling figure.</p>

<p>"Madame," said he, "it is not
permitted to pray here. You are
caught in open violation of the law;
you will have to answer for it before
the police court. Your name?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the lady; "I
am Madame l'Amirale Bruat, governess
to his highness the Prince Imperial."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>The terrible Jacomet had, above
all things, a respect for the social
hierarchy and the powers that be.
He did not pursue the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</i>.
Such scenes were often renewed.
Certain of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbaux</i> frightened
the agents, and may possibly
have frightened the prefect himself.</p>

<p>A deplorable state of things: his
orders were violated with impunity
by the powerful, and cruelly
maintained at the expense of the
weak. He had two sets of weights
and measures.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>The question raised by the various
supernatural occurrences, by the
apparitions&mdash;true or false&mdash;of the
Blessed Virgin, by the breaking out
of the fountain, and by the real or
imaginary cures, could not remain
for ever in suspense. Such was the
conviction of everybody. It was
necessary that the matter should
be submitted to severe and competent
inquiry.</p>

<p>Strangers, who spent but a short
season in the place, who had not
witnessed from the first the miraculous
events, and who could not form
a conviction from personal knowledge,
as could the inhabitants of the
surrounding country, amid the various
accounts and opinions that were
to be heard from all quarters, were
unanimous in their astonishment at
the apparent indifference of the clergy.
And, while they blamed the
inopportune meddling of the civil
power, they also censured the prolonged
inaction of the religious authority,
personified in the bishop.</p>

<p>The free-thinkers, interpreting the
hesitation of the prelate to their own
advantage, felt confident of his final
verdict. The partisans of Baron
Massy began to announce an entire
accord between the sentiments
of the bishop and those of the prefect.
They cast the entire responsibility
of the violent measures upon
Mgr. Laurence.</p>

<p>"The bishop," they said, "might,
by a single word, have put a stop to
this superstition. It was only necessary
for him to deliver his judgment
on the matter. But in default of his
action, the civil authority has been
forced to proceed."</p>

<p>But in view of the evidence for
the miracles, the faithful considered
the final judgment as certainly favorable
to their belief. Moreover, a
great number of strangers who had
no conviction nor party prejudices,
sought to be relieved of their uncertainty
by a definitive examination.
"Of what use," said they, "is religious
authority if not to decide such
matters, and to fix the faith of those
whom distance, or lack of documents,
or other causes, prevent from examining
and settling the question for
themselves?"</p>

<p>Continual demands reached the
ears of the bishop. The murmur of
the crowd was swelled by the voice
of those that are usually styled the
"enlightened class," although their
lesser lights sometimes cause them to
lose sight of brighter ones. Everybody
demanded a formal inquest.</p>

<p>Supernatural cures continued to
manifest themselves. Hundreds of
authentic affidavits of miraculous
cures, signed by numerous witnesses,
were daily received at the bishop's
palace.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span></p>
<p>On the 16th of July, the Feast of
Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Bernadette
heard again within herself the
voice which had been silent for some
months, and which no longer called
her to the Massabielle rocks, then
fenced and guarded, but to the right
bank of the Gave, to the meadow where
the crowd knelt and prayed beyond
reach of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbaux</i> and annoyance
of the police. It was now eight
o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the child prostrated
herself and commenced to recite her
beads, when the divine Mother appeared
to her. The Gave, which separated
her from the grotto, had no
existence for her ecstatic vision. She
saw only the blessed rock, quite
close to her, as formerly, and the immaculate
Virgin, whose sweet smile
confirmed all the past and vouched
for all the future. No word escaped
her heavenly lips. At a certain moment
she bent towards the child as if
to take a long farewell. Then she
re-entered paradise. This was the
eighteenth apparition: it was to be
the last.</p>

<p>In a different or opposite sense,
strange facts now took place which
it is necessary to notice. On three
or four occasions, certain women and
children had, or pretended to have,
visions similar to those of Bernadette.</p>

<p>Were these visions real? Was diabolical
mysticism endeavoring to
mix with the divine in order to
trouble it? Was there at the bottom
of these singular phenomena a mental
derangement or the ill-timed trickery
of naughty children? Or was there a
hostile hand secretly at work pushing
forward these visionaries in order to
cast discredit on the miracles at the
grotto? We cannot tell.</p>

<p>The multitude, whose eyes were
fixed on all the details, and who
eagerly sought to draw conclusions
from what they already knew, were
less reserved in their judgment.</p>

<p>The supposition that the false visionaries
were incited by the police immediately
took possession of the
public mind as being very consistent
with the policy of the authorities.
The children who pretended to
have had visions mingled their accounts
with most extravagant incoherencies.
Once they scaled the barrier
which enclosed the grotto, and, under
pretence of offering their services to
the pilgrims, of procuring the water
for them, and of touching their beads
on the rock, they received and appropriated
money. Strange to say,
Jacomet did not interfere with their
proceedings, although it would have
been quite easy to have arrested
them. He even affected not to notice
these strange scenes, ecstasies,
and violations of the enclosure. From
this surprising behavior of the
shrewd and far-sighted chief, everybody
concluded the existence of one
of those secret plots of which the
police, and even the administration,
are sometimes thought capable.</p>

<p>"Baron Massy," so they said,
"sees that public opinion is withdrawing
from him, and, convinced
that open violence is insufficient to
put a stop to these events, has sought
to dishonor them in principle by encouraging
the false visionaries, full
accounts of whom we shall soon see
in the journals and the official reports.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Is fecit cui prodest.</i>"</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the
truth of these suspicions, perhaps incorrect,
such scenes could not but
disturb the peace of souls. The
curé of Lourdes, moved by these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
scandals, immediately expelled the
pretended seers from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">catechisme</i>,
and declared that, if similar occurrences
took place in the future, he
would not rest until he had exposed
their true instigators.</p>

<p>The position and threats of the
curé produced a sudden and radical
effect. The pretended visions ceased
at once, and nothing more was heard
of them. They had only lasted four
or five days.</p>

<p>M. Peyramale notified the bishop
of this occurrence. M. Jacomet, on
his part, addressed to the authorities
an exaggerated and romantic statement,
of which we will have future
occasion to speak. This audacious
attempt of the enemy to destroy the
true nature and honor of the movement
only added to the reasons
which called peremptorily for action
on the part of the bishop. Everything
seemed to indicate that the
moment for interference had come,
when the religious authority should
set about examining and giving sentence.</p>

<p>Men of distinction in the Catholic
world, such as Mgr. de Salines, Archbishop
of Auch; Mgr. Thibaud, Bishop
of Montpellier; Mgr. de Garsignies,
Bishop of Soissons; M. Louis
Veuillot, chief editor of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Univers</i>;
and persons less widely celebrated,
but of national reputation, such as
M. de Rességuier, formerly a deputy;
M. Vène, chief engineer of mines,
and inspector-general of thermal
waters in the Pyrenees; and a great
number of eminent Catholics, were
at that time in the country.</p>

<p>All had examined these extraordinary
facts which form the subject of
our history; all had interrogated
Bernadette; all were either believers
or strongly inclined to believe. They
tell of one of the most venerated
bishops, that he was unable to control
the emotion awakened by the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naif</i> statement of the little seer.
Gazing upon the open brow which
had received the glance of the ineffable
Virgin Mother of God, the prelate
could not restrain the first movement
of piety. The prince of the church
bowed before the majesty of that
humble peasant.</p>

<p>"Pray for me; bless me and my
flock," he cried, choked with emotion,
and sinking on his knees.</p>

<p>"Rise! rise! my lord! It is yours
to bless her," said the curé of Lourdes,
who was present, and instantly seized
the bishop's hand.</p>

<p>Although the priest had sprung forward
quickly, Bernadette had already
advanced, and, all abashed in her humility,
bowed her head for the blessing
of the prelate.</p>

<p>The bishop gave it, but not without
shedding tears.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The entire course of events, the
testimony of such grave men, and
their evident conviction after examining,
were facts which made a lively
impression on the clear and sagacious
mind of the Bishop of Tarbes. Mgr.
Laurence thought that the time had
now come to speak, and he came
forth from his silence. On July 28,
he published the following orders,
which were immediately known
throughout the entire diocese, and
produced intense excitement; for
every one understood that the
strange position which he had hitherto
assumed was now about to
have its solution:</p>


<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Order of His Lordship the Bishop
of Tarbes, constituting a commission
to report on the authenticity
and nature of certain facts
which have, for six months, been
taking place on occasion of a real
or pretended apparition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
Blessed Virgin in a grotto situated
west of the town of lourdes.</span></p>

<p>"Bertrand-Severe-Laurence, by the mercy
of God and the apostolic favor of the
Holy See, Bishop of Tarbes.</p>

<p>"To the clergy and faithful of our diocese,
health and benediction in our Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Facts of grave importance, and intimately
connected with religion, have been
occurring at Lourdes since the eleventh
of last February. They have stirred our
whole diocese, and their fame has been
re-echoed in foreign parts.</p>

<p>"Bernadette Soubirous, a young girl
of Lourdes, fourteen years of age, has
had visions in the Massabielle grotto,
situated west of that town. The Blessed
Virgin has appeared to her. A fountain
has risen on the spot. The water of this
fountain, having been drunk or used as a
wash, has operated a great number of
cures, which are considered miraculous.
Many persons have come from parts of
our own and from neighboring dioceses
to seek, at this fountain, the cure of various
diseases, invoking the Immaculate
Virgin.</p>

<p>"The civil power has been alarmed by
this. The ecclesiastical authority has
been urged by all parties, since the
month of March, to make some declaration
concerning this improvised pilgrimage.
We have delayed, up to the
present time&mdash;believing that the hour
was not come for us to deal successfully
with this matter, and also that, to give
due weight to our judgment, it would be
necessary to proceed with wise moderation,
to distrust the prejudices of the first
days of popular enthusiasm, to allow agitation
to quiet itself, to give time for reflection,
and to procure light for an attentive
and clear investigation.</p>

<p>"Three classes appeal to our decision,
but with different views:</p>

<p>"First are those who, refusing all examination,
see in the events at the grotto,
and in the cures attributed to its water,
only superstition, jugglery, and deceit.</p>

<p>"It is evident that we cannot, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</i>,
share their opinion without serious examination.
Their journals have, from
the start, cried, and loudly too, superstition,
fraud, and bad faith. They have
affirmed that the affair of the grotto has
had its rise in sordid and guilty cupidity,
and have thus wounded the moral sense
of our Christian people. The plan of denying
everything and of accusing intentions
seems to us very convenient for cutting
off difficulties; but, on the other
hand, very disloyal to sound reason, and
more apt to irritate than to convince. To
deny the possibility of supernatural facts
is to follow a superannuated school, to abjure
Christianity, and to proceed in the
ruts of the infidel philosophy of the last
century. We, as Catholics, cannot take
counsel in such a matter with those who
deny God's power to make exceptions to
his own laws, nor even join them in examining
whether a given fact is natural
or supernatural, knowing in advance that
they proclaim the impossibility of the supernatural.
By this, do we shrink from
thorough, sincere, and conscientious discussion
enlightened by advanced science?
By no means. On the contrary, we desire
it, with all our heart. We wish these facts
to be submitted to the severest tests of
evidence compatible with sound philosophy,
and, accordingly, to determine whether
they are natural or divine, that prudent
men, learned in the sciences of mystical
theology, medicine, physics, chemistry,
geology, etc., etc., be invited to the
discussion, in order that science shall be
consulted and give her sentence. And
we desire, above all, that no means be
neglected to ascertain the truth.</p>

<p>"Another class neither approve nor
condemn the events which are everywhere
recounted, but suspend their judgment.
Before pronouncing definitely,
they wish to know the views of competent
authority, and earnestly ask for
them.</p>

<p>"Finally, a third and very numerous
class have become thoroughly, though
perhaps prematurely, convinced. They
impatiently look to the bishop to pronounce
immediately on this grave affair.
Although they expect from us a decision
favorable to their own pious sentiments,
we know their obedient spirit well enough
to be assured that they will agree with our
judgment, whatever that may be, as soon
as it is known.</p>

<p>"It is, therefore, to enlighten the piety
of so many thousands of the faithful, to
correspond with an urgent public appeal
to settle the uncertainty and quiet the agitation
of souls, that we yield to-day to instances
repeated and continued, from all
parts. We desire light on facts in the highest
degree important to the faithful, the
worship of the Blessed Virgin, and religion
itself. To this end we have resolved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
institute in our diocese a permanent commission
for collecting and reporting upon
the facts which have occurred, and which
may hereafter occur, at or concerning the
grotto of Lourdes, in order to make known
their character and supply us with the
means indispensable to arriving at a true
judgment.</p>


<p class="p2">"<span class="smcap">Wherefore</span>,</p>

<p>"The holy name of God having been
invoked,</p>

<p>"We have ordered and hereby order as
follows:</p>

<p>"Art. I. A commission is hereby instituted
in the diocese of Tarbes, to examine
the following points:</p>

<p>"1. Whether cures have been worked
by drinking, or by bathing with the water
of the grotto of Lourdes; and whether
these cures can be explained naturally or
are to be attributed to something above
nature.</p>

<p>"2. Whether the visions which are said
to have been seen by the child Bernadette
Soubirous have been real; and, in the latter
case, whether they can be explained
naturally or are to be invested with a
supernatural character.</p>

<p>"3. Whether the object which is said
to have appeared manifested its intentions
to the child; whether she has been
charged to communicate them, and to
whom; and what were the said intentions
or demands.</p>

<p>"4. Whether the fountain which is now
running in the grotto existed before the
alleged visions of Bernadette Soubirous.</p>

<p>"Art. II. The commission will present
for our consideration only facts established
by solid evidence, concerning
which it will prepare minute reports
containing its own judgment on the
matter.</p>

<p>"Art. III. The deans of the diocese will
be the principal correspondents of the
commission.</p>

<p>"1. They are desired to call attention
to facts which have taken place in their
respective deaneries.</p>

<p>"2. The persons who are allowed to
testify concerning such acts are:</p>

<p>"3. Those who, by their science, can
enlighten the commission.</p>

<p>"4. The physicians who have had
charge of the sick before their cure.</p>

<p>"Art. IV. After having received notices,
the commission will proceed to
examination. Evidence must be rendered
under oath. When investigations
refer to localities, at least two
members of the commission must visit
the spot.</p>

<p>"Art. V. We earnestly recommend the
commission to invite to its sessions men
well versed in the sciences of medicine,
physics, chemistry, geology, etc., in order
to hear them discuss the difficulties which
may arise on points familiar to them, and
in order to learn their opinion. The commission
will neglect no means of acquiring
light and arriving at the truth, whatever
that may be.</p>

<p>"Art. VI. The commission shall be
composed of nine members of our chapter,
the superiors of the great and little
seminaries, the superior of the missionaries
of our diocese, the curé of Lourdes,
and the professors of dogmatic and moral
theology and physics of the great seminary.
The professor of chemistry in our
little seminary shall be often consulted.</p>

<p>"Art. VII. M. Nogaro, canon-arch-priest,
is hereby named president of the
commission. The Canons Tabariés and
Soulé are named vice-presidents. The
commission will appoint for itself a secretary
and two vice-secretaries from its own
number.</p>

<p>"Art. VIII. The commission will immediately
enter upon its labors, and meet
as often as it shall deem necessary.</p>

<p>"Given at Tarbes, in our episcopal
palace, under our sign and seal, and the
countersign of our secretary, July 28,
1858.</p>


<p class="signature">"✠ <span class="smcap">Bertrand-Sre</span>,</p>

<p class="in2">"By command, <span class="smcap">Fourcade</span>,</p>

</p></blockquote>

<p>His lordship had scarcely issued
this order when he received a letter
from M. Rouland, Minister of Public
Worship, entreating him to interfere
and arrest the movement.</p>

<p>In order to comprehend the full
meaning of this letter, it will be necessary
for us to turn back a short
distance.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>Whether the police or administration
had incited the false visionaries
or were the innocent victims of universal
suspicion, it is impossible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
know with certainty; it is still more
impossible to establish either opinion
by authentic documents. In such
cases the proof, if there be any, is
always destroyed by interested hands.
There are, consequently, no other
means of getting at the truth, except
the general appearance of things and
the unanimous sentiment of the contemporary
public, sometimes assuredly
just, though often tinged by passion
or infected with error. In view of
this chaotic state of the elements, the
historian can only relate facts both
authentic and alleged, express his
own doubts and scruples, and leave
the reader to determine upon the
most probable explanation.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause or hidden hand
might have been which pushed forward
two or three little ragamuffins
to make seers of them, M. Jacomet,
M. Massy, and his friends felt bound
to magnify and spread their silly story.
They endeavored to attract the attention
of the people, and withdraw it
from such grave events as the divine
ecstasies of Bernadette, the bursting
forth of the fountain, and the miraculous
cures which had laid hold of
popular faith. When the battle had
been lost on one point, these able
strategists sought to lure the enemy
on to a field surrounded by ambuscades
and mined in advance; in
short, to make a diversion.</p>

<p>The sudden disappearance of the
false visions and visionaries before
the threatened scrutiny of M. Peyramale
upset, for several days at least,
the fond hopes of the free-thinking
strategists. The common sense of
the public remained firm on the true
ground of controversy, and did not
permit itself to be deceived. The
enlightened intellect of Minister Rouland
did not fare so well. What follows
will explain how this independent
spirit was overthrown.</p>

<p>MM. Jacomet and Massy were
striving against a triumphant and irresistible
force, and taxed the utmost
resources of their genius to make out
of these slight events a final pretext
for repairing their losses and reassuming
an offensive part. They sent to
the Minister of Public Worship an
exaggerated and fantastic account of
these childish scenes.</p>

<p>Now, by an illusion barely conceivable
in a politician acquainted with
ordinary practice, M. Rouland placed
blind confidence in their official reports.
He was not without faith,
although injudicious, one may say,
in selecting the object of his trust.
The philosopher Rouland had no
faith in Our Lady of Lourdes asserting
herself by cures and miracles,
but he had perfect faith in Massy
and Jacomet. These two gentlemen
made him believe that, under the
shadow of the Massabielle rocks,
children officiated as priests, that the
people, represented by creatures of
dishonest life, crowned them with
laurels and flowers, etc., etc.</p>

<p>They did not disguise the uselessness
of violent measures against the
general excitement of spirits. According
to their account, material force
was vanquished and the civil authority
completely brought to naught.
The religious authority alone could
save the day by energetic action
against the popular belief. Desperate
as to their own straits, and little
considering the dignity of a Christian
bishop, they presumed to think that
strong pressure from the upper heights
of the administration could force
Mgr. Laurence to condemn what had
transpired and to follow their views.
Accordingly they signified to the
minister their judgment that the solution
of all difficulties would be the
direct interference of the prelate.</p>

<p>This was to push his excellency
in the direction towards which, as
is well known, he naturally inclined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
viz., to mix himself in religious questions,
and to foster the desire of making
out a programme for the bishops.</p>

<p>The minister, although he had
once been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur-general</i>, did not
think of asking how it was that the
police had not prosecuted in the
courts the profanations which they
reported. The strange abstinence of
the magistracy in view of the pretended
disorders did not occasion him the
slightest suspicion.</p>

<p>Accepting with more than ministerial
candor the romance of the police
and the prefect, and imagining
that he saw the whole truth; moreover,
believing himself nothing less
than a theologian, and, because Minister
of Public Worship, something
more than an archbishop, M. Rouland
settled the whole affair in his cabinet,
and wrote to Mgr. Laurence a letter,
in all respects a worthy mate of the
one he had formerly addressed to the
prefect, and which we have cited. It
was strongly impregnated with the
same official piety, and whilst we
read it to-day by the light of true
history, we cannot restrain a smile
at the manner in which rulers are
sometimes hoodwinked and mocked
by their inferior agents. Indeed, it
is not without a sad irony that one
sees the following letter written by
the very minister who, in a short
time, was to sign the permission to
build a splendid church on the Massabielle
rocks in eternal memory of
the apparition of the Blessed Virgin
Mary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My lord," wrote M. Rouland, "the
recent advice which I have received about
that affair at Lourdes seems to me calculated
to afflict deeply the hearts of all
sincerely religious men. This blessing
of rosaries by children, these public demonstrations
in the first ranks of which
are to be seen women of doubtful character,
this coronation of the visionaries,
and other grotesque ceremonies which
parody the rites of religious worship, will
not fail to open a free avenue of attack to
Protestant and other journals, unless the
central authority interferes to moderate
the ardor of polemics. Such scandalous
scenes degrade religion in the eyes of
the people, and I feel it my duty again to
call your most serious attention to them....
These deeply to be regretted
demonstrations seem to me of such a character
as to summon the clergy from the
reserve which it has hitherto maintained.
On this point I can do no more than to
make a pressing appeal to the prudence
and firmness of your grace <i>by demanding
if you do not think it proper to rebuke publicly
such profanity</i>. Receive, etc.,</p>


<p>The Minister of Public Instruction and Worship,</p>

<p class="signature">"<span class="smcap">Rouland</span>."
</p></blockquote>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>This missive reached Mgr. Laurence
just after he had issued the ordinance
already known to the reader,
and had appointed a commission to
examine the extraordinary works
wrought by the hand of God.</p>

<p>Although singularly astonished and
indignant at the fantastic account so
gravely offered by the good minister
as the truth itself, nevertheless, the
bishop answered his letter in measured
terms. Without expressing a complete
judgment, in order not to hasten
a premature solution of the matter,
he rehabilitated the facts which had
been so shamefully misrepresented.
He set forth with great frankness the
line of conduct which he and his
clergy had pursued, until events had
got to such a pass that it was necessary
to interfere and order a commission
of inquiry. To the minister,
who, without knowledge or examination,
had said, "Condemn," he answered,
"I will examine."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur le Ministre</span>," wrote the prelate,
"great was my amazement on reading
your letter. I also am informed as
to what takes place at Lourdes, and, as
a bishop, deeply interested in reproving
all that can harm religion and the faithful.
Now, I can assure you that no such
scenes as you describe exist, and, if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
have been any occurrences worthy of regret,
they have been transitory and have
left no traces behind them.</p>

<p>"The facts to which your excellency
alludes transpired after the grotto was
shut up, and after the first week in July.
Two or three children of Lourdes pretended
to have visions, and behaved extravagantly
in the streets. The grotto
being then shut up, as I have said, they
found means to get into it, and to offer
their services to visitors stopped at the
barricades, in order to touch their chaplets
on the rock inside the grotto, and to
appropriate the offerings received from
them. One of them who was most remarkable
for his eccentricities was a
choir-boy in the church of Lourdes. The
curé rebuked and drove him out of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">catechisme</i>, and excluded him from the
service of the church.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The disorder
was only transitory, and amounted only
to the mischief of a few boys, which ceased
as soon as it was reprehended. Such
are the facts which <i>overzealous</i> persons
have magnified into permanent scenes.</p>

<p>"I would be much gratified, M. le Ministre,
if you would seek a fair statement
of what has occurred from honorable
persons who have remained here for some
time in order to make personal observations
of places, and to interrogate the
child who is said to have had the vision.
Such are Mgrs. the bishops of Montpellier
and Soissons, Mgr. the Archbishop
of Auch, M. Vène, inspector of thermal
waters, Madame l'Amirale Bruat, M. L.
Veuillot, etc., etc.</p>

<p>"The clergy, M. le Ministre, have up
to this time maintained a complete reserve
with regard to the occurrences at
the grotto. The clergy of the town have
shown a most admirable prudence. They
have never gone to the grotto to give credit
to the pilgrimage, nor, on the other
hand, favored the measures of the administration.
Nevertheless, they have been
represented to you as encouraging superstition.
I do not accuse the head magistrate
of the department, whose intentions
have always been good; but in this matter
he has had an exclusive confidence
in his subordinates.</p>

<p>"In my reply to the prefect, dated 11th
of last April, which has been submitted
to your perusal, I offered my hearty concurrence
with the magistrate in order to
bring this affair to a happy conclusion.
But I have not been able to do what was
desired of me, namely, to condemn from
the pulpit, without examination, inquiry,
or apparent reason, the persons who go
to pray at the grotto, and to forbid all approach
to it, especially when no disorder
had been noticed, although on certain
days the visitors amounted to thousands.
Moreover, while the church has always
some motive for her prohibitions, and
while I myself was not sufficiently posted
as to facts, I was also certain that amid
the general excitement my words would
have passed unheeded.</p>

<p>"The prefect, during the council of revision
at Lourdes, on May 4th, caused
the chief of police to remove the religious
emblems left at the grotto, and, in an address
to the mayors of the canton, stated
that he had taken this measure by agreement
with the diocesan bishop, an assertion
which was repeated a few days afterward
by the official organ of the prefecture.
I was informed of this measure
only by the journals and the curé of
Lourdes.</p>

<p>"I hastened to write to the latter to
cause the prefect's order to be respected.
I made no complaint at that time or afterward
of having been made an apparent
party to a measure of which I had been
left in ignorance. Although numerous
letters were addressed to me entreating
me to disclaim any share in it, I have refrained
from adding any difficulty to the
situation.</p>

<p>"After the religious objects had been removed
from the grotto, we might have hoped
to see the number of visits diminish,
and the pilgrimage, so inconsiderately improvised,
brought to an end. It was not
so, however. The public rightly or wrongly
pretended that the water from the
grotto worked marvellous cures. The
concourse became more numerous, and
crowds came from the neighboring departments.</p>

<p>"On the 8th of June, the mayor of
Lourdes issued a prohibition forbidding
all access to the grotto. This was stated
to be in the interest of religion and public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
welfare. Although religion might
have been encouraged by it; and, again,
although the bishop had not been consulted,
he published no reclamation
against these assertions; he kept silence
for reasons above stated.</p>

<p>"You see, M. le Ministre, by these details,
that the reserve of the clergy has
not been complete in this matter; it has
been, in my judgment, prudent. When
able, I have lent my aid to the measures
of the civil authority, and, if they have
not met with success, it is not the bishop
who is to blame.</p>

<p>"To-day, yielding to the petitions which
have been addressed me from all quarters,
I have concluded that the time has
come when I can interest myself to good
purpose in this affair. I have named a
commission to collect the elements necessary
for me to form a decision on a
question which has moved the whole
country around us, and which, judging
from reports, seems likely to interest the
whole of France. I am confident that the
faithful will receive it with submission,
since they are aware that no effort will
be spared to get at the truth. The commission
having been at work for some
days, I have determined to render my ordinance
public by having it printed, in
hopes that it may help to calm spirits until
the decision shall have been made
known. I shall soon have the honor of
sending your excellency a copy.</p>


<p class="in4">"I am, etc.,</p>

<p class="signature">"B. S., Bishop of Tarbes."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the letter from Mgr. Laurence
to M. Rouland. It was clear
and decisive, and left nothing to be
said by either party. The Minister
of Public Worship did not reply. He
re-entered his former silence. This
was very wise. Perhaps, however, it
would have been wiser for him never
to have come out of it.</p>


<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>At the very moment when Mgr.
Laurence, in the name of religion,
ordered an inquiry into the unwonted
events which the civil authority had
condemned and persecuted and wished
to reject <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à priori</i>, without condescending
even to examine; on the
very same day on which the bishop's
letter was mailed for the minister, M.
Filhol, the illustrious professor of the
faculty of Toulouse, delivered the
final verdict of science on the water
from the grotto of Lourdes. The conscientious
and perfectly thorough labor
of the great chemist reduced to
nothing the official analysis of M. Latour
de Trie, the expert of the prefecture,
about which Baron Massy had
made such a noise. M. Filhol testifies
as follows:</p>

<p>"I, the undersigned, Professor of
Chemistry to the Scientific Faculty of
Toulouse, Professor of Pharmacy and
Toxicology to the School of Medicine
of the same city, and Knight
of the Legion of Honor, certify that
I have analyzed the water from a
spring in the neighborhood of Lourdes.
From this analysis it appears
that the water of the grotto of Lourdes
is of such composition that it may
be considered good for drinking purposes,
and of a character similar to
that which is generally met with
among those mountains whose soil is
rich in calcareous matter.</p>

<p>"<i>The extraordinary effects which are
said to have been produced by the use
of this water cannot, at least in the
present state of science, be explained by
the nature of the salts whose existence
in it is detected by analysis.</i><a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>"<i>This water contains no active substance
capable of giving it marked therapeutic
qualities.</i> It can be drunk
without inconvenience.</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Toulouse</span>, August 7, 1858.</p>

<p class="signature">"(Signed) <span class="smcap">Filhol</span>."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, all the pseudo-scientific scaffolding,
on which the free-thinkers
and wise counsellors of the prefect
had painfully built their theory of the
extraordinary cures, on the examination
of this celebrated chemist
toppled and fell. According to true
science, the water of the grotto was
by no means mineral water, and
had no healing property. Nevertheless,
it did heal. Nothing was now
left for those who had so rashly put
forward imaginary explanations, but
the confusion of their attempt
and the impossibility of withdrawing
their public acknowledgment that
cures had been effected. Falsehood
and error were taken in their own
net.</p>

<h2>THE APOSTASY OF DR. DÖLLINGER.</h2>


<p>The formal and public act of renunciation
of the Catholic faith by
Dr. Döllinger which has been looked
for as a probable event for many
months past, has at length been
made. In itself, such an act cannot
be regarded by any sound Catholic
as of any moment whatever to religion
or the church. It is only one
suicide more, which destroys an individual,
but does not hurt the stability
of the church, whose life is in God,
and, therefore, immortal. It may
have more or less of accidental importance,
however, on account of its
effect upon certain persons who are
weak or ill-instructed in the faith,
and the use which may be made of it
by the enemies of the church. We
think it proper, therefore, to make
some explanations concerning the
past and present acts and opinions
by which Dr. Döllinger has gradually
but surely approached and finally
reached his present position of open,
declared rebellion against the infallible
authority of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>Dr. Döllinger has been living, until
a recent period, upon the reputation
which he had acquired during his
earlier career as a professor and an
author, supported by his high rank
in the church as a mitred prelate,
and in the state as a member of the
Bavarian House of Peers. His great
intellectual gifts and extensive learning
in the department of history have
never been questioned, and he was
deservedly honored through a long
course of years as one of the chief
ornaments and ablest advocates of
the Catholic religion in Germany.
The relative superiority very commonly
assigned to him, however, we
are inclined to think, is only imaginary.
Even in history he has met
with some very severe defeats from
antagonists more powerful than himself,
and in philosophy and theology
he has never shown himself to be a
master. He is now an old man,
seventy-three years of age, having
spent above forty years of this period
in his professorial chair at the
University of Munich. During the
earlier part of his life, as is proved
by unimpeachable testimony, he was
a strict Ultramontane in his theology.
The gradual progress by which
he went slowly down the declivity
towards his present position we cannot
pretend to trace accurately. It
is certain, however, that no public
expression of opinions having a heterodox
tendency, on his part, excited
any general notice before the year
1861. Even then, although the murmur
of dissatisfaction which has been
growing louder ever since began to
be heard, and the sure Catholic instinct
began to make its wounded
susceptibilities known, the substantial
orthodoxy and loyalty of Dr. Döllinger
were not questioned or even
doubted. This is proved by the language
used by the editor of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der
Katholik</i> at that time, in which he
says that the book which had
given offence, namely, the celebrated
"Church and Churches," "is imbued
with the genuine color of sincere
Catholic faith and immovable fidelity
to the church <i>and her supreme head</i>."<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
From that date to the present time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>these first indistinct intimations of
what now appears as a full-blown
heresy can be seen in their successive
stages of clearer manifestation in the
writings and acts of Dr. Döllinger.
The language used by him is ambiguous,
and generally capable of being
understood in a good sense, and his
steps are cautious. There is nothing
to compromise him seriously, before
the time of the intrigues which
went on under his direction for the
purpose of defeating the Vatican
Council. Looking back, however,
upon the dark ways in which he has
been walking, and the dark sayings
which he has been uttering, in the
light which his present open declaration
of rebellion casts behind him,
everything becomes clear and apparent
to the day. There is a continuity
and a logical sequence manifest in
those ambiguous utterances, when
explained in a schismatical and heretical
sense, which they otherwise could
not have. The acts and expressions
of Dr. Döllinger's disciples in Germany,
France, and England appear
in their coherence and in their relation
to the instruction which they
received from their master. Moreover,
a series of historical facts, in
connection with the University of
Munich and with Dr. Döllinger himself,
show themselves in their proper
bearing; and among other things of
this kind, the secret end and object
of the famous scientific congress of
Munich become perfectly manifest.
In a word, Dr. Döllinger has had an
idea which has gradually supplanted
the Catholic idea in his mind, and
for the sake of which he has at last
sacrificed the last lingering remnant
of honor, conscience, loyalty, and
divine grace in his soul, and stooped
so low as to write his name at the
bottom of that long and infamous
list of traitors and heretics against
whom none have ever pronounced
sterner sentence of condemnation
than himself. This great idea has
been nothing less than the reunion
of Christendom on a basis of compromise
between the Catholic Church
and the Eastern and Western sects,
excluding the supremacy of the Roman
Church and Pontiff. This is no
new idea of Döllinger's. The only
thing which was new and original in
it was the particular scheme or plan
of operation for carrying it into effect.
Even this was not originated by Döllinger
himself, but first planted in the
mind of Maximilian II., King of Bavaria,
during his youth, by Schelling.
When this able and enterprising
prince ascended the throne, he undertook
the extraordinary task of effecting
a universal intellectual and
moral unification of Germany, of
which Munich should be the radiating
centre. The union of the different
religious confessions formed a
principal part of this plan. Moreover,
Germany was to become the
mighty power, after being united in
herself, to bring all the rest of Christendom
into unity in a perfect Christian
civilization, which would then
extend itself triumphantly through the
rest of the world. The great lever
by which this mighty work was to
be accomplished was to be a society
of learned men and able statesmen,
directed by the sovereign authority
of the king himself. The gathering
point for these learned men was naturally
the University of Munich, and
from the chairs of this university
would proceed that teaching and
influence which should train up a
body of disciples ready to sustain
and carry out in their various professions
and posts of influence the grand
project conceived in the philosophic
brain of Schelling and eagerly adopted
by his royal pupil. As a matter
of course, those professors of the
university who were thoroughly loyal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
to Rome must either submit to the
royal dictation or be removed. Phillipps
and several other distinguished
professors sacrificed their places to
their conscience. Döllinger submitted.
This was the fatal rock on
which he split, the one which has
caused injury or total shipwreck in
every age of the church to so many
eminent ecclesiastics. It was necessary
to choose between unconditional loyalty
to the spiritual sovereignty of the
Pope, or subserviency to the usurpation
of the temporal prince. This
was the real question from the outset,
and hence Dr. Döllinger's utter
abjuration of the Papal supremacy is
but the last logical consequence of
this weak yielding at the beginning.
Bossuet yielded to Louis XIV. in a
similar manner. But Bossuet was a
thoroughgoing theologian, priest, and
bishop. He yielded against the
grain, and his heart was always Roman
and on the side of the Pope.
Therefore Bossuet only marred but
did not destroy his character and
work as a great bishop and a great
writer. His Gallicanism is only a
single flaw in a majestic statue. But
in the case of Döllinger, the German,
the ambitious scholar, the courtier
has predominated over and finally
cast out entirely the Catholic,
the theologian, and the priest. He
has not been a passive tool, but a
most active and energetic master-workman
in carrying out the plan of
Schelling and Maximilian. Nevertheless,
he has been cautious, secret,
and indirect in his method of working,
not attacking openly, but artfully
undermining the citadel of the
faith, throwing out hints and scattering
seeds which he left to germinate
in other minds, in his published
works, and chiefly intent upon privately
initiating certain chosen persons
into his doctrines. In this way,
a subtle and deadly poison has long
been spreading its baleful influence
among a certain class of intellectual
Catholic young men not only in
Germany, but also in France and
England. Thank God! this secret
poisoning by concealed heresy has
been stopped. The poison is now
openly exposed to view, and advertised
as a pleasant refrigerant or
gentle purgative medicine, but is
likely to deceive no one who is in
good faith, for its color, taste, and
smell betray it; and whoever has
made his head dizzy for awhile by
hastily swallowing a few drops by
mistake is likely to be trebly cautious
for the future.</p>

<p>We have already described in general
terms the Munich heresy, but
we will make a more precise and
analytical statement of its principal
component elements. As we have
already said, it proposes certain principles
and methods for the reconstruction
of Christendom. First, the
Catholic Church must be reformed
in doctrine and discipline. The
Œcumenical Councils as far back as
the Seventh are to be set aside. The
authority of any Œcumenical Council
is only final in so far as it is a witness
of the traditional belief of the
whole body of the faithful. The authority
of the decisions of the Holy
See must be set aside, and the supremacy
of the Sovereign Pontiff be
reduced to a mere patriarchal primacy.
The state is completely supreme
and independent. Sacred and secular
science are exempt from all control
except that of the dogmas of
faith. When the Catholic Church is
purified in doctrine and discipline,
the other portions of Christendom
are to be united with it in one grand
whole, combining all that is good in
each one of them, and itself more
perfect than any. The supreme and
ultimate judgment in regard to religious
dogmas is in the universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
Christian sentiment or consciousness,
enlightened and directed by men
of science and learning.</p>

<p>To certain minds, there is something
specious and high-sounding
about this theory. It is, however, a
mere Russian ice palace, which melts
when the direct rays of the sun fall
upon it. It is essentially no better
than the doctrine of Huss and Luther.
It is very nearly identical with
that of Dr. Pusey. It is old Protestantism
revamped, and varnished with
a mixture of rationalism and orientalism.
The supreme authority of the
Holy See being set aside, and the
decrees of general councils submitted
to the judgment of the great body
of the clergy and people, where is
the rule of faith? Pure Protestantism
gives us, in lieu of the infallible
teaching authority of the living
church, the Bible, interpreted by the
private judgment of each individual.
The Munich theory gives us the
Bible and apostolic tradition, interpreted
by the public judgment of the
aggregate mass of the faithful. But
how is the individual to determine
what that judgment is? The historical
and other documents by which
the common and universal tradition
of all ages can be ascertained
are voluminous. Moreover, it is a
matter of controversy how these documents
are to be understood. Only
the learned can fully master and understand
them. The common people
must, therefore, be instructed by the
learned. But the learned do not
agree among themselves. What,
then, is left for the individual, except
a choice among these learned doctors
or among several schools of doctors
which one he will follow? This choice
must be made by his private judgment,
and, if not a blind following of
a leader or a party, it must be made
by a careful examination of the evidences
proving that this or that man,
Dr. Döllinger, for example, thoroughly
understands the Scripture, the Fathers,
and ecclesiastical history, and
truly interprets them. Is there any
hope of unity by such a method?
Is there any hope of any individual,
even, arriving at certainty by it? It
is a return at last to the old Protestant
principle of private judgment,
with a substitution of something far
more difficult than the Bible in place
of the Bible which Luther substituted
for the church.</p>

<p>Practically it amounts to this: Dr.
Döllinger is the greatest and wisest
of men; he knows all things. Take
his word that so much and no more
is the sound orthodox doctrine handed
down from the apostles and believed
in all ages, and you are right.
Let the Pope and the bishops and the
whole world believe and obey Dr.
Döllinger. It is Luther's old saying
repeated by a man of less strength
and audacity, but equally absurd and
insupportable pride. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic voleo, sic jubeo:
stet pro ratione voluntas.</i><a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Pius
IX. and the bishops in the Vatican
Council, so far from complying with
the modest desires of Dr. Döllinger,
have condemned the very radical
idea of his heresy, and all other heresies
cognate with it, have crushed his
conspiracy, and blown away into
thin air the painted bubble of a reformed
Catholic Church, and a reunion
of Christendom on a basis of
compromise. There was no alternative
for Dr. Döllinger and his partisans
except submission to the decrees
of the council, or to the anathema
by which they were fortified. Ample
time for reflection and deliberation
was allowed him, and now, seven
months after the solemn promulgation
of the decrees of the Council of
the Vatican, he has deliberately and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>coolly refused submission, thereby
openly and manifestly cutting himself
off from the communion of the
Catholic Church. His manner of
doing it is a signal illustration of the
ridiculous attitude which a man of
sense is often driven to assume when
he has given himself up to the sway
of pride. He desires the Archbishop
of Munich to permit him to be heard
in his own defence before a council
of German bishops, or a court formed
from the Cathedral Chapter. If
this is to be considered as an appeal
from the Council of the Vatican to
another tribunal, whose decision he
is willing to submit to as final, nothing
can be more absurd. An appeal
from the supreme tribunal to an inferior
court is certainly something unheard
of either in civil or canon law.
The dogmas denied and rejected by
Dr. Döllinger have been thoroughly
examined and discussed in a general
council. Judgment has been pronounced,
and the case is closed for
ever. The Archbishop of Munich
and the German prelates are bound
by this judgment, have assented to
it, and have proclaimed it to their
subjects. They have no authority to
bring it under a new examination, or
reverse it, in a judicial capacity. If
they sit in judgment on Dr. Döllinger,
or any other individual impeached
of heresy, that judgment is their
paramount law, according to which
they must decide. The only questions
which can come before them in
such a case are, whether the person
who is a defendant before their court
has contravened the decisions of the
Vatican Council by word or writing,
and whether he is contumacious in
his error. It can scarcely be supposed
that a man who refuses submission
to a general council and the
Holy See could have any intention
or disposition to submit to a national
council or an episcopal court. The
only alternative supposition is that
he desired to prolong the controversy,
to gain time, to inflame the
minds of men, to create a party and
inaugurate a schism. Really and
truly, his demand amounts to this:
"The majority of the bishops of the
Catholic Church, having been misled
by their theological instruction, have
made an erroneous decision in a matter
of dogma. I therefore request the
bishops of Germany to permit me to
give them better instruction, and persuade
them to recall their adhesion
to that decision. If that cannot
be done, I request the Archbishop
of Munich to do me that favor."
The silliness of such a demand is
only equalled by its effrontery. Dr.
Döllinger must be very far gone indeed
in pride to fancy that the Archbishop
of Munich or the German
prelates could think for an instant of
making themselves his docile disciples,
or entertain the thought of following
him into schism and heresy.
It is an act of parting defiance, the
impotent gesture of a desperate man,
whose last stronghold is crumbling
under his feet, but who prefers to be
buried under its ruins rather than to
repent and return to his allegiance.</p>

<p>The appeal to German national
sympathy and prejudice is worthy of
a man whose worldly and selfish
ambition has extinguished the last
spark of genuine Catholic feeling in
his bosom. It is a cry for sympathy
to the bad Catholics, the Protestants,
and the infidels of Germany. It is a repetition
of that old saying of Caiphas
against Jesus Christ, "The Romans
will come and take away our place
and nation." Nothing can be more
unhistorical than the assertion that
Papal supremacy wrought division
in the past German Empire, or more
contrary to sound political wisdom
than the assertion that the same
threatens division in the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
Empire of the present. Martin Luther
sowed the dragon's teeth from
which sprang civil war, disastrous
foreign war, internal dissension, and
all the direful miseries which have
come upon Germany since his inauspicious
rebellion against the Holy
See. The so-called Reformation
turned the Protestant princes against
the Emperor, stirred up the revolt of
the peasants, inspired the treachery
which opened the gates to Gustavus
Vasa, and instigated that alliance
with Louis XIV. which lost Lorraine
and Alsace to Germany. That infidel
liberalism which is the legitimate
offspring of the revolt against Rome
is the most dangerous internal enemy
which the present empire has to
fear. It is summed up in the list of
errors condemned by Pius IX. in his
Encyclical and Syllabus. On the
contrary, the complete restoration of
Catholic unity and Papal supremacy
in Germany would bring back more
than the glories of the former empire,
and renew the epoch of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>As for the vain and feeble effort
of two or three cabinets to prohibit
the promulgation of the decrees of
the Vatican Council, it is too absurd
to argue about, and too harmless to
excite any alarm or indignation.
Neither is there any danger that Dr.
Döllinger's apostasy will cause any
serious defection among the Catholic
people of Germany. The professors
of the University of Munich have
been appointed by the king. Some
are Protestants, others are infidels,
and others have been hitherto Catholics
in profession, but followers of
the heresy of Janus in their heart.
There are many laymen and some
clergymen of the same sort among
the professors of Germany, and a
certain number of persons in other
walks of life, whose faith has been
undermined and corrupted. We have
always expected that the Council of
the Vatican would cause a considerable
number of defections from the
communion of the church. But
we have no expectation that this defection
of individuals will consolidate
into a new concrete heresy. John
Huss and Martin Luther have exhausted
the probabilities of pseudo-orthodox
reformation. Its race is
run. The time for heresy is past.
Organized opposition to the Catholic
Church in these days must take a
more consistently anti-Christian form.
Pius IX. and Garibaldi represent
the only two real parties. Döllinger
is nobody, and has no place. That
a great many baptized Catholics have
totally renounced the faith is undoubtedly
true. But the Catholic
people who still retain the principles
and the spirit of their traditional faith
are with Pius IX. This is true of
the Bavarian and other German popular
masses, as well as of the people
of other nations. The German prelates,
the clergy, the nobility, are
strong and enthusiastic in their allegiance
to the Holy See. The orthodox
theologians and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> can
wield the ponderous hammer of
science with as much strength of aim
as any of the scholars who have
been fostered in the sunshine of
royal favor. The boast made by
Dr. Döllinger at the Congress of
Munich of the pre-eminence which
Germany will gain in Catholic theology
and sacred science will probably
be in part fulfilled, though not in the
sense which he had in his mind. It
will be fulfilled, not by men who bid
a haughty defiance to the saints and
doctors of the church, who utter
scornful words against the scholars
of other nations, who are governed
by narrow-minded national prejudice
and unreasoning obstinacy, and who
are faithless in their allegiance to
their spiritual sovereign, while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
are servilely obsequious to a temporal
monarch. It will be done by
true, genuine Catholics, the legitimate
offspring of the great men who
founded, governed, taught, and made
illustrious the old church and empire
of Germany in past ages.</p>

<p>The gist of the entire quarrel of
Dr. Döllinger with the Archbishop
of Munich consists in an appeal from
the supreme authority in the church
to the principle of private judgment.
In form, it is an appeal to the Holy
Scriptures and the Fathers, but this is
only an appeal to Dr. Döllinger's
own private interpretation of the true
sense of Scripture and the Fathers.
It is the same appeal which heretics
and schismatics have made in all
ages: Arius, Nestorius, Pelagius,
Huss, Luther, Cranmer, Photius,
Mark of Ephesus, the Armenian
schismatics of Constantinople, and
all others who have rebelled against
the Holy See. It is the essence of
Protestantism, and in the end transforms
itself into rationalism and infidelity.
The ancient heretics, the
Oriental schismatics, Anglicans, Lutherans,
Calvinists, Unitarians, all
have a common principle, all are
Protestants. That principle is the
right of private judgment to resist
the supreme authority of the Catholic
Church. So long as private
judgment is supposed to be directed
by a supernatural light of the Holy
Spirit, and to possess in Scripture and
tradition, or in Scripture alone, a
positive revelation, Protestantism is
a kind of Christianity. When the
natural reason is made the arbiter,
and the absolute authority of the
doctrine of Jesus Christ as taught by
the apostles is denied, it is a rationalistic
philosophy, which remains
Christian in a modified and general
sense until it descends so low as to
become simply unchristian and infidel.
The Catholic principle which
is constitutive of the Catholic Church
as a body, and of each individual
Catholic as a member of it, is the principle
of authority. There is no logical
alternative between the two. One
or the other must be final and supreme,
the authority of the church
or the authority of the individual
judgment. If the authority of the
church is supreme, no individual or
aggregate of individuals can reject or
even question its decisions. It is the
Catholic doctrine that authority is
supreme. The church is constituted
by the organic unity of bishops,
clergy, and people, with their Head,
the Bishop of Rome, the successor of
St. Peter. He is the Vicar of Christ,
and possesses the plenitude of apostolic
and episcopal authority. His
judgment is final and supreme, whether
he pronounces it with or without
the judicial concurrence of an œcumenical
council. This has always
been the recognized doctrine and
practice of the church. It is nothing
more or less than Papal supremacy
as existing and everywhere believed,
as much before as after the Council
of the Vatican. The word "infallibility,"
like the words "consubstantial"
and "transubstantiation," is only
the precise and definite expression of
that which has long been a dogma
defined under other terms, and always
been contained in the universal
faith of the church based on Scripture
and apostolic tradition. The first
Christians were taught to obey implicitly
the teachings of St. Peter and
the apostles, because they had received
authority from Jesus Christ.
There was nothing said about infallibility,
because the idea was sufficiently
impressed upon their minds in a
more simple and concrete form.
Their descendants, in like manner,
believed in the teaching of the successors
of the apostles because they
had inherited their divine authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Whoever separated from the Roman
Church and was condemned by the
Roman Pontiff was at once known
to have lost all authority to teach.
The teaching of the bishops in communion
with the Roman Church, and
approved by the Roman Pontiff, was
always known to be the immediate
and practical rule of faith. Whoever
taught anything contrary to
that was manifestly in error, and,
if contumacious, a heretic, who
must be cast out of the church,
however high his rank might be.
Moreover, the Roman Pontiff decided
all controversies, and issued his
dogmatic decrees to all bishops, who
were required to receive and promulgate
them under pain of excommunication.
This unconditional obedience
to an external authority evidently
presupposes that the authority
obeyed is rendered infallible by the
supernatural assistance of the Holy
Ghost. Hence, the express and explicit
profession of the infallibility of
the church as a dogma of faith has
been universal ever since it has
been made a distinct object of thought
and exposition. It is nothing more
than a distinct expression of one part
of the idea that the church has divine
and supreme authority to teach, with a
corresponding obligation on the faithful
to believe her teaching. In like
manner, the divine and supreme authority
of the Pope to teach includes
and implies infallibility, as the vast
majority of bishops and theologians
have always held and taught. The
erroneous opinion that the express
or tacit acquiescence of the bishops is
necessary to the finality of pontifical
decrees in matters pertaining to
faith and doctrine, was tolerated by
the Holy See until the definitions of
the Council of the Vatican were promulgated.
The infallibility of the
church itself produces this agreement
of the episcopate with its head. In
fact, therefore, and practically, the
pontifical decrees were always submitted
to by good Catholics, and
the Holy See did not formally and
expressly exact any more than this
as a term of Catholic communion.
Dr. Döllinger and others of the same
stamp took advantage of this toleration
of an illogical and erroneous
opinion to undermine the doctrine of
Papal supremacy and the authority
of œcumenical councils. The Pope
cannot possess the supreme power
of teaching and judging, they argued,
without infallibility. He is not
infallible, therefore, he is not supreme.
Moreover, the only certain
criterion by which we know that a
council is œcumenical is the sanction
of the Pope. If he is not infallible,
he may err in giving this sanction.
Thus, the way was opened to
dispute the authority of the Councils
of Trent, Lateran, Florence, etc.,
and to rip up the whole texture of
Catholic doctrine, just so far as suited
the notions of these audacious
innovators. The event has proved
how opportune and necessary was
that distinct and precise definition
of the infallibility of the Roman Pontiff
which has for ever shut out the
possibility of sheltering a fundamental
heresy like that of Döllinger behind
an ambiguous expression. There
is now no more chance for evading
the law and remaining ostensibly a
Catholic. The law is clear and plain.
All dogmatic decrees of the Pope,
made with or without his general
council, are infallible and irreformable.
Once made, no pope or council
can reverse them. There is no
choice left to the prelates about
enforcing them on their clergy and
people. No clergyman holds his position,
and no one of the faithful is
entitled to the sacraments, on any
other terms than entire submission
and obedience. This is the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
principle, that the church cannot err
in faith. She has declared it to be
an article of faith that the Roman
Pontiff, speaking <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i> as the
supreme doctor of the church, is infallible.
It is therefore a contradiction
in terms for a person who denies
or doubts this doctrine to call himself
a Catholic. We cannot too constantly
or earnestly impress this truth
on the minds of the Catholic people,
that the rule of faith is the present,
concrete, living, and perpetual teaching
of that supreme authority which
Christ has established in the church.
We believe, on the veracity of God,
by a supernatural faith which is given
by the Holy Ghost in baptism,
those truths which the holy church
proposes to our belief. The church
can never change, never reform her
faith, never retract her decisions, never
dispense her children from an obligation
she has once imposed on
them of receiving a definition as the
true expression of a dogma contained
in the divine revelation. To do
so, would be to destroy herself, and
fall down to the level of the sects.
The idle talk of writers for the secular
press, whether they pretend to
call themselves Catholics or not,
about the church conforming herself
to liberal principles and the spirit of
the age is simply worthy of laughter
and derision. No Catholic who has
a grain of sense will pay any heed
to opinions or monitions coming
from such an incompetent source.
The church is the only judge of the
nature and extent of her own powers,
and of the proper mode of exercising
them. The pontiffs, prelates,
pastors, priests, and theologians of
the church, are her authorized expositors
and interpreters, her advocates
and defenders. Those who desire to
be her worthy members, and those
who wish to learn what she really is,
will seek from them, and from them
only, or from authors and writings
which they have sanctioned, instruction
in the true Catholic doctrine.
The unhappy man whose defection
has called forth these remarks has
lost his place in the Catholic hierarchy,
and henceforth he is of no more
account than any other sectarian
of past times or of the present.
The ecclesiastical historian will record
his name in the list of the
heretics of the nineteenth century,
and his peculiar ideas will pass
into oblivion, except as a matter
of curious research to the scholar.</p>

<h2>FALSE VIEWS OF SAINTSHIP.</h2>


<p>We often hear the saints spoken
of as men of another race and stature
than ourselves, splendid masterpieces
of perfection meant to be admired
from a distance, but certainly
not to be copied with loving and
minute care.</p>

<p>Now, this is a mistake&mdash;the most
fatal mistake for ourselves; for we
thus tie down our faculties to commonplace
life, and refuse to give
them the wider scope that nature
herself meant for their exercise; the
most unfortunate mistake for religion,
because in making her heroes inaccessible
and almost unnatural, we deter
others from laudable efforts, and
attach to our faith the stigma of present
sterility.</p>

<p>Not only can each one of us become
a saint, and that by a simple
and ordinary course of life, but the
canonized saints themselves bear witness
that they reached heaven in no
other way, and attained their crowns
by no other means. The saint, be
assured of it, is the truest gentleman,
the pleasantest companion, and most
faithful friend.</p>

<p>He is no morose misanthrope, no
disenchanted cynic; he is a man
with all the natural feelings of humanity,
all the amiable traits of good-fellowship,
all the nameless graces of
good society. There is no pleasing,
amenity of human intercourse, no
rational exchange of human sentiments,
no harmless relaxation of a
refined mind, that need be foreign
to his nature, and a stranger to his
heart.</p>

<p>All men prize honor and straight-forwardness;
they welcome cheerfulness
and vivacity; they admire a
strong will; love of nature and art,
sympathy with suffering and with
poverty, zealousness in the cause of
learning, are all passports to their
favor, and incline them to seek the
friendship and trust the advice of
those in whom these qualities shine.</p>

<p>Now, if we show them that canonized
saints and great men well known
in the annals of the church have always
been distinguished by these
traits, will they refuse to admit that
the more a man loves his God, the
fitter he is to win human sympathy
and command human imitation?</p>

<p>The saints have not seldom been
unfairly treated, and chiefly by their
overzealous biographers; for their
holiness has been distilled into such
ethereal and miraculous abstractions
that we no more dream of grasping
it as a means of encouragement than
we do of seizing for nourishment upon
the summer clouds whose lovely
shapes entrance our eyes in the western
heavens.</p>

<p>Every one of the saints had an individual
character, touching weaknesses
of disposition and innocent
partialities of nature. Every one of
them went to heaven by a separate
road, and his specialty of human
and natural character alone determined
that road. Some were kings
and emperors, princes and popes,
and great men of the earth; they
had to wear soft garments and ermine
robes, and spend much time in
the display their state required. Now,
many sanctimonious persons would
have us believe that such display is
absolutely and in itself wrong, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
can under no circumstances be allowable.
The church thinks otherwise,
and more generously, and has
canonized these men.</p>

<p>Some were beggars or servants,
mechanics or husbandmen; passed
their days in menial pursuits, and apparently
had their minds occupied
only by the sordid necessities of their
humble degree. Many presumptuous
people like to tell us that servile
work deteriorates the mind, that beggary
is invariably a criminal state,
that poverty dwarfs the understanding
and hardens the heart. The
church thinks otherwise, and more
charitably, and these too she has canonized.</p>

<p>Again, some were statesmen and
scholars, and the wranglings of courts,
the tumult of embassies, the disputes
of universities, were the daily atmosphere
they breathed. Some officious
persons tell us plainly that solitude is
the only nurse of holiness, and that,
with these surroundings, it is impossible
to live unbewildered by the world's
noise and untainted by the world's
corruption. The church thinks otherwise,
and more liberally, and has
canonized these men also.</p>

<p>No station in life is too low or
too high for God to look upon, and
therefore not too low nor too high
for God's saints to thrive in.</p>

<p>The secret of saintship lies in the
power of a man to fashion his surroundings,
and mould the circumstances
attendant on his lot in life,
till he makes them into a ladder
wherewith to climb to heaven.</p>

<p>Suppose a man is born to high
destinies, and a great fortune: they
are ready-made instruments in his
hand for the glory of God and the
good of his neighbor. Let him recollect
that Jesus was of a royal race,
and was visited by Eastern kings.</p>

<p>Suppose, on the contrary, he is
born poor, and sees no means of future
advancement all his life: there
again are his weapons chosen for
him to fight the good fight. Let
him remember that Jesus was born
in a stable, and lived in a carpenter's
shop.</p>

<p>If a man is clever, intellectual, talented,
his road to heaven lies in the
good use he makes of these gifts of
mind; if he is cheerful, good-humored,
well-bred, his road to heaven lies
in the charitable use he makes of his
natural attractiveness; if he is placed
in circumstances that grievously
try his temper and his patience, long-suffering,
resignation, and gentleness
will be the evident path for him; if
surrounded by difficulties and occupying
a responsible position, discretion
and delicacy will be his appointed
road.</p>

<p>There is no forcing the spiritual
life; it grows out of the natural life,
and is only the natural life, shorn of
self and self-love, supernaturalized.</p>

<p>Life is a battle; we all have to
fight it, but even in a material combat,
what general would arm all his
soldiers alike? Are there not cavalry
and infantry, lancers and riflemen?
Do not some wield the sword, others
man the guns? So in the combat
whose promised land is paradise; we
fight each with diverse weapons, and
our one thought should be, not to
envy others their arms, but do effectual
service with our own. Men fight
one way, women another. Both can
fight as well; but only by using their
own weapons.</p>

<p>There is an old French fable that
speaks of the frog who sought to
swell himself to the size of the ox,
forgetting that he could be as happy
and as useful in his small fish-pond as
the larger animal in his spacious meadow.
He <em>would</em> not be a frog, but
of course he <em>could</em> not become an ox,
so he died of his effort, and the world
counted one worker less. Just so do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
some of us act when we sigh over the
life of some great saint of old, and,
putting down the book in sentimental
admiration as barren as it is useless,
cry out, "If only <em>I</em> could be an
Augustine, a Theresa, a Thomas Aquinas!"
To such might we answer:
"Do you know why they were
saints? Because they acted up to
the lights they had. If <em>you</em> act up to
your inferior but no less true lights,
you too will be a saint." If Augustine,
and Theresa, and Thomas Aquinas
had spent their lives in sterile
sentimentality, calling upon the dead
saints before them, where would <em>they</em>
have been, and who would have
heard of their names? At that rate,
there would have been no saints at
all after the twelve apostles, and even
they would have sat down in profitless
discouragement because their
holiness could not equal that of the
Son of God!</p>

<p>Did not the Creator say to all
things living, vegetable or animal,
"Increase and multiply," and "Let
the earth bring forth the green herb,
and such as may seed, and the fruit-tree
bearing fruit <i>after its kind</i>"? In
that one commandment lies the secret
spring of the energy and fruitfulness
of every created thing, spiritual
no less than temporal. Let each one
of us bear fruit <i>according to his kind</i>,
and God will be satisfied. Augustine
and Gregory, Thomas and Bonaventure,
Francis of Assisium and Francis
of Sales, Charles Borromeo and Vincent
of Paul, Philip Neri and Ignatius
Loyola, were men, very <em>men</em>,
and, had they not been men, they
could not have been saints. We
mean, their sanctity would have been
other than it actually was; it would
have been even as the holiness of
the angels, the untempted steadfastness
of pure spirits. Had they been
born as the Blessed Virgin, immaculate
in the very initial moment of existence,
they would not have been the
saints they are, the imitable, human,
weakling beings we yearn over and
love with a natural and sympathetic
love.</p>

<p>Nature, whatever people may say
of her, is not contrary to grace: not
in this sense at least, that she is the
field, and grace the plough. The
plough does not alter the earth it
furrows; it only prepares it, stirs it,
turns its better surface uppermost,
and displays its richest loam to receive
the grain. As neither rain, nor
dew, nor manure can turn one soil
into another, so can no efforts of
overstrained piety, no devices of ambitious
perseverance, re-create the
soul and portion it anew. As God
made us, so we stand: by taking
thought, we cannot add to our stature
one cubit, neither can we force a
foreign growth to bloom on the low-lying
lands of our soul. One sort of
grain grows best in one sort of earth.
Would any husbandman dream of
planting the wrong grain in it? God
is a husbandman, and shall he do
less well than mortal man, and shall
he endeavor to force one soil to bear
the crop it cannot nourish? No, no!
God gave us one nature as well as
the graces he plants therein, and we
may trust to him to see the harvest
reaped. It is men, it is ourselves,
who interfere with our sowing and
reaping time; it is ourselves, who ambitiously
seek to grow grain we can
never rear, or it is others who maliciously
sow tares in a soil they too
quickly overrun. Then the world
will see in us her saints, men going
simply through the round of their
daily duties, very unostentatiously,
very quietly, never boasting, because
to have time to boast they must
needs leave off their work; never
lamenting, because to lament they
would have to leave off their prayer;
but letting their nature fill itself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the brim with God, and, when it is
full, letting it quietly overflow to their
neighbor.</p>

<p>That sounds very simple, does it
not? Yes, because everything that
belongs to God is simplicity itself,
and the more simple a man is, the
nearer God he is.</p>

<p>All the great men and women
whose names stud the calendar of
the church owed their greatness to
their simplicity, and the words of the
greatest saint that ever lived, the
words of her, were they not the simplest
ever found on record: "Be it
done unto me according to thy
word"?</p>

<p>Saints of our timid generation,
saints of our half-hearted century,
saints of our hitherto barren civilization,
start up, and fill the plains and
the valleys of all lands, fill the offices
of the city and the homes of the
citizens, fill the church, the courts,
the universities, fill the lowly serried
ranks of the poor, fill the more burdened
and more responsible phalanx
of the noble and the rich!</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Life of St. Thomas of Aquin.</span> By
Father Vaughan, O.S.B. London: Longmans,
Brown, Green &amp; Co. Vol. I.
For sale by The Catholic Publication
Society, New York.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a good stout volume, like
St. Thomas himself. It is a book
for its outward appearance such as
we seldom see. We have many well-printed
books, but this one is remarkable
for its large, clear type,
which makes it pleasant and easy
to read. The subject is one of the
greatest interest and importance.
The life and times of St. Thomas
have a peculiar charm about them,
aside from the history of his genius,
and of his philosophical and theological
system. The two together
make a theme which far surpasses
in grandeur and attractiveness even
the history of the majority of great
saints. St. Thomas is the great doctor
of the church. His intellectual
sway is something without a parallel.
The study of his works is on the increase,
and he is likely to acquire
even a greater and more universal
sway than he enjoyed before the Reformation.
We have never before had
a really good biography of St. Thomas
in English. Father Vaughan has
taken hold of the work with zeal
and ability. It is only half published
as yet, but the first volume presents
so large a portion of the angelic
doctor's life before us that we
can estimate its value as well as if
we had the whole. An analysis of
some of the principal works of St.
Thomas is given by F. Vaughan, and
he endeavors to present to the reader
a picture of the times when he
lived, as well as to describe the
events of his personal history.
Every student should have this
book. It is indeed a wonderful
thing to see such a specimen of
genuine old monastic literature issuing
from the English press. It
makes us hope that England may
yet become once more the merrie
Catholic England of the olden time.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">My Study Windows.</span> By James Russell
Lowell, A.M., Professor of Belles-Lettres
in Harvard College. Boston:
James R. Osgood &amp; Co. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>Met with in the pages of a review
or magazine, Mr. Lowell's prose is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
always sure to be more or less pleasant
reading. His wit, his refinement,
and a certain something which
we are only unwilling to call his delicacy
of appreciation, because, in
spite of his generally acknowledged
merits as a critic, he seems to us
not always perfectly reliable in that
capacity, always find him willing
and amused readers. But when he
shuts up too much of his work at
once between a pair of covers, and
gives whoever will a too easy opportunity
of comparing him with himself,
we doubt whether even his admirers&mdash;a
class in which we are not
unwilling to include ourselves&mdash;do
not find him a little wearisome, and
discover in him a poverty of suggestion
and a timidity of thought which
gibbet him as a book-maker, although,
being in a measure counterbalanced
by an abundance of lighter
merits, they would have left him
an easy pre-eminence over most of
his contemporaries as a magazinist.
Nor, if we may for once adopt a
method of criticism from which our
author himself is not averse, and
trust our instinct to read between
the lines, is Mr. Lowell altogether
free from a suspicion that such may
possibly be the case&mdash;and that, as
affecting his own culture and habit
of mind also, it was a far-reaching
mistake in our Puritan ancestors to
cut themselves quite asunder from
the traditions of the past before
they came here to establish free
thinking and free religion along with
a free government. However it
may be with government, neither
thought nor faith seems to flourish
well without having its roots in
the past. Like their transcendentalist
sons, our New England progenitors
were themselves "Apostles
of the Newness," and simply antedated
them by a few generations in
the experiment of throwing overboard
a great deal of valuable freight,
and trying to right themselves by
laying in a supply of useless ballast.
The sentiment which they dignified
by the name of trust in Providence
appears nowadays under a less equivocal
disguise as self-reliance; and
while it produces certain easily appreciable
results both in society and
literature, it makes instability, a
want of solidity, and an absence of
germinative force permanent characteristics
of both of them. Not,
however, to make an essay on a
sufficiently suggestive topic, but to
confine ourselves to the particular
matter in hand, it is perhaps Mr.
Lowell's <i>thin-skinnedness</i> as an author,
and a characteristic modesty
as to the value of his utterances,
none the less apparent for being put
carefully out of sight, which give
him, to our thinking, his best claim
to the liking of his readers&mdash;while
at the same time it is a modesty so
well justified by the actual state of
the case as to explain why it is that
one is always more ready to accept
with satisfaction what he has to say
about an author whose claims have
been tested by more than one generation
of critics, than to trust him
for a thoroughly reliable estimate of
a literary workman of to-day. Even
in the former case one inclines to
believe that he may sometimes feel
a just preference for his own opinions
in contradistinction to those of
Mr. Lowell&mdash;who is not, for instance,
likely to elicit much intelligent sympathy
with his verdict on the poetical
merits of the "Rape of the
Lock." By far the pleasantest portions
of the present volume are the
three opening essays, in which Mr.
Lowell quite forgets that he is a
critic, or, at least, that he is a critic
of books. The essays on Carlyle
and Thoreau contain also a good
deal of sound, if not particularly
subtle, criticism; and in general, although
the book does not show Mr.
Lowell in his most characteristic
vein, it pleases us all the better on
that account, as giving us what substance
there is in his thought, with
much less than ordinary of the
technical brilliancy which wearies
quite as often as it entertains.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Dion and the Sibyls.</span> A Classic Christian
Novel. By Miles Gerald Keon,
Colonial Secretary, Bermuda, author
of "Harding the Money-Spinner," etc.
New York: Catholic Publication Society.
1871. 1 vol. 8vo, pp. 224.</p></blockquote>

<p><cite>Dion and the Sibyls</cite> is a work of
uncommon merit, and may be classed,
in our opinion, with <cite>Fabiola</cite> and
<cite>Callista</cite>, which is the highest compliment
we could possibly pay to a
romance of the early period of Christian
history. The Dion of the story
is Dionysius the Areopagite in his
youth, and before his conversion.
The Sibyls are introduced in reference
to their predictions of a coming
Saviour of mankind. The object
of the author is to exhibit the
fearful need which existed in heathen
society for a divine intervention,
and the general, widespread desire
and expectation of such an event
at the time when our Lord actually
appeared on the earth. This is done
by means of a plot which is woven
from the personal history of a nephew
of Lepidus the Triumvir, a
young Roman noble of Greek education,
and an intimate friend of
Dionysius, who came to Rome with
his mother and sister at the close
of the reign of Augustus, to claim
the sequestrated estate of his father,
one of the generals who helped to
win the battle of Philippi. The appeal
of the young Paulus Æmilius
Lepidus to Augustus at a time when
the latter was visiting the wealthy
Knight Mamurra at his superb villa
at Formiæ, and a plot of Tiberius
Cæsar to carry off Agatha, the young
man's sister, afford an occasion of
describing the principal persons of
the Roman court. This is done in
a graphic and masterly manner. The
representation of the aged Augustus
is something perfect in its kind.
The portraits of Tiberius, Germanicus,
Caligula, then a child, the royal
ladies, Sejanus the Prætorian prefect,
Velleius Paterculus, Thellus the
chief of the gladiators, and a number
of other persons representing
various classes of Romans, are admirably
and vividly drawn. The
breaking of the ferocious Sejan
horse by the young Æmilius at the
public games of Formiæ is a scene
of striking originality and power.
The campaign of Germanicus against
the Germans is also well described.
In fact, Mr. Keon makes the old
Roman world reappear before us
like a panorama. He shows himself
to be a thorough and minute classical
scholar and historian on every
page and in every line. But beyond
and above all this, he exhibits a
power of philosophical reasoning,
and an insight into the deepest significance
of Christianity, which elevate
his thrilling romance to the
rank of a work of the highest moral
and religious scope. The description
of the demons by the Lady
Plancina is an original and awfully
sublime conception surpassing anything
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mystique Diabolique</i> of
Görres. The author's great masterpiece,
however, is the argument of
Dionysius on the being of One God
before the court of Augustus, a
piece of writing of which any professed
philosopher might be proud.</p>

<p>The history of Paulus Æmilius,
who is really the hero of the work,
brings him at last to Judæa at the
time of the murder of St. John the
Baptist, and the closing scenes of
the life of our Lord. This gives the
author the opportunity of describing
a momentary glimpse which the
brave and virtuous Roman was favored
with of the form and countenance
of the Divine Redeemer, as
he was passing down the Mount of
Olives. Mr. Keon undertook a difficult
task, one in which many have
failed, when he ventured on introducing
the august figure of our Lord
into his picture. We are fastidious
in matters of this kind, and not easily
satisfied by any attempt at giving
in language what sculptors and
painters usually fall short of expressing
in marble and on canvas. Mr.
Keon's bold effort pleases us so
much that we cannot help wishing
he would try his hand at some more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
sketches of the same kind. We
should like to see some scenes from
the evangelical history and the Acts
of the Apostles produced under an
ideal and imaginative form with an
ability equal to that which our author
has displayed in his pictures
of the Augustan age. The success
of Renan's <cite>Life of Jesus</cite> is due not
so much to the popularity of his detestable
and absurd theories, as to
the attraction of his theme and the
charm of a vivid, lifelike representation
of the scenes, manners, and
events of the period when our Lord
lived and taught in Judæa. A similar
work, produced in accordance
with the true Catholic idea of the
august, divine person of the Son of
God made man, would do more to
counteract the poison of the infamous
infidel literature of the day
in the popular mind than any grave
argumentative treatise. We pronounce
Mr. Keon's <cite>Dion and the Sibyls</cite>
without hesitation to be a dramatic
and philosophical masterpiece,
and we trust that he will not
allow his genius to lie idle, but will
give us more works of the same sort.
Whether the vitiated taste of the
novel-reading world will appreciate
works of so classical a stamp, we
are unable to say. But all those
who relish truth conveyed through
the forms of the purest art will
thank Mr. Keon for the pleasure he
has given them, if they shall, as we
did, by chance take up his book
and peruse it attentively, and will
concur with us in wishing that a
work of so much merit and value
might be better known and more
widely circulated.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fifty Catholic Tracts on various Subjects.</span>
First Series. New York: The
Catholic Publication Society, 9 Warren
Street. 1871</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>The wish so often expressed of
seeing "The Catholic Tracts" in a
book form has been met by this
volume. The variety of its contents
makes it a book for circulation
among all classes of society. Short,
popular, and conclusive answers
are given on questions of the day,
making it of great value as a work
of actual controversy, while not a
few of the tracts are instructive and
devotional, rendering it equally important
to Catholics.</p>

<p>The volume is printed on good
paper, and its price brings it within
the reach of every one. We recommend
it to the attention of clergymen,
and the confraternities, sodalities,
and Rosary societies, as a book
for distribution among a reading
and thinking people seeking
after religious truth. We give
the preface entire:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the spring of 1866, the Catholic
Publication Society issued its first tract.
Since that time it has published fifty
tracts on different subjects. More than
two and one half millions (2,500,000) of
these short and popular papers have been
sold and circulated. This is sufficient
evidence of their value and popularity.</p>

<p>"Some of the ablest writers in our
country have contributed to this work.
Although we have never given the names
of the authors, we feel at liberty to say
that eminent prelates and learned theologians&mdash;men
who have a world-wide reputation&mdash;have
written many of these
tracts. A well-written tract often costs
more labor than an essay or an article
for a magazine.</p>

<p>"Nor have these tracts been written
and circulated without good effect. We
know of Protestants converted and received
into the church by their means.
Countless prejudices against our religion
have been removed, even when persons
have not been led to become Catholics.
Their minds have been thus prepared
for accepting the truth at some
future day. In addition to this, we must
remember that many of the tracts are
written for the instruction of Catholics.
Numerous letters from those in charge
of hospitals, asylums, and prisons, in various
sections of our country, bear testimony
to their value in this respect.</p>

<p>"An objection is sometimes made to
the word 'tract.' We do not altogether
like the word ourselves. If any friend
can suggest a better, we will cheerfully
adopt it. Until then, we must continue
to use it. Surely Catholics have a right
to any word in the English language.
Sometimes an objection is made to the
tract form of publication. Those who
have scruples on this score are relieved
by the publication of this volume. These
tracts now form a book. No one can
fairly object to the matter it contains.</p>

<p>"We trust, therefore, that they who
find benefit from this little volume of
tracts will endeavor to increase its circulation.
To the clergy we recommend
Tract 50 as one intended to place before
them a practical method of circulating
Catholic literature among their people.
We cannot close without expressing the
strong desire to see this volume spread
over the length and breadth of our land."</p></blockquote>

Most Holy Virgin.</span> By the Abbé
Barthe. Translated from the French

<p>This handsome work supplies a
want long felt. It contains meditations
on each phrase of the Litany
from the <i lang="el" xml:lang="el">Kyrie eleison</i> to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Agnus
Dei</i>. These meditations are of suitable
length for May devotions, and
are admirable for their solidity no
less than for their piety. The Abbé
Barthe is an honorable Canon of
Rodey (France); and we cannot do
better than quote the letter of his
bishop. He says: "I rejoice that a
priest of my diocese ... has
given to learned and Christian
France a work which will be widely
diffused, and which will make the
august Mary loved, admired, and
venerated in these lines, when, more
than ever, we need to place ourselves
under her glorious protection."</p>

<p>There are also letters of commendation
from Cardinal Giraud, Archbishop
of Cambria, and his grace the
Archbishop of Paris, to which is
added the approbation of the Bishop
of Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>May this "Monument to the Glory
of Mary" (as it is called) meet
in this country with the circulation
it deserves, and be the means of
spreading wide and deep the love
and worship of her whose Immaculate
Conception is our patronal
feast.</p>

<p>To those who take a delight in
reading about the planets and stars,
this work will prove both instructive

are very fine, and the work is
got up in uniform style with the

<p>This is an interesting story descriptive
of a family living in the
Roman province of Cappadocia in the
fifth century, giving quaint pictures
of life in those early days, and lovely
glimpses of the natural beauties of
the country. The object of the tale
is to illustrate the special judgments
of Almighty God on disobedient children
and an overindulgent parent,
who out of a weak fondness put
no restraints upon her children in
their youth. The terrible retribution
that follows a parent's curse, and the
remorse and bitterness of heart that
must be the portion of neglectful parents,
are well portrayed by Madame
De La Grange. The volume will be
an excellent addition to our Sunday-school
libraries.</p>

<p>We would suggest to the publisher
the propriety of a thinner and better
paper. It does not look seemly
to print books on common paste-board.</p>

<p>This is a paper of no great length,
but of great service to the cause of
faith. It is in every respect worthy
of the pen of Father Coleridge.
He sets before us the parables in
quite a new light, as meant to teach
us the ways of God to men. Why
our Lord chose the parabolic form
of teaching and why he said so much

great force and clearness.</p>

the name of the author is a sufficient

<h2>AN IRISH MARTYR.</h2>


<p>Towards the close of the year
1645, the venerable oratorian, Father
Peter Francis Scarampo, who had
spent two years in Ireland on a special
mission from the Holy See, was
permitted to resign his position and
return to Rome. He was accompanied
thither by five young students
whose relatives desired that they
should complete their theological
studies in the colleges of the Eternal
City. Of these, the most distinguished
for early proficiency and
gentleness of disposition was a youth
named Oliver Plunket, then in his
sixteenth year, having been born at
Loughcrew, county of Meath, in 1629,
a near relative and protégé of the
Bishop of Ardagh, Doctor Patrick
Plunket, and closely connected by
ties of kindred with some of the
noblest families of Ireland, and with
many distinguished ecclesiastics at
home and on the Continent. Father
Scarampo had borne himself so
wisely and with so much charity and
discretion while in Ireland, that his
departure was regarded as a public
misfortune, and his retiring footsteps
were followed to the sea-coast by
thousands of pious and grateful people;
and, though his humble spirit
would not allow him to accept the
distinguished post of Papal Nuncio,
and so remain among them, he never
ceased to remember their hospitality
and long-suffering and to befriend
their cause at Rome upon all occasions.
On the young men entrusted
to his care he bestowed every
possible favor, and especially on
young Plunket, in whom he took a
fatherly interest up to the day of his
untimely death on the plague-stricken
Island of St. Bartholomew, even to
the extent of defraying that student's
expenses for the first three years of
his novitiate.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in Rome,
Oliver Plunket entered the Irish
College of that city, then under the
charge of the Jesuit Fathers, and
for eight years devoted himself with
great industry and success to the
study of philosophy, mathematics,
and theology, subsequently attending</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>
<p>the usual course of lectures on canon
and civil law in the Roman University.
Previous to his appointment
to the See of Armagh, the Rector of
the Irish College, in response to an
enquiry of the Sacred Congregation
of Propaganda, presented the following
honorable testimony of the character
and abilities of the future Primate:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I, the undersigned, certify that the
Very Reverend Dr. Oliver Plunket,
of the diocese of Meath, in the province
of Armagh, in Ireland, is of
Catholic parentage, descended from
an illustrious family; on the father's
side, from the most illustrious Earls
of Fingal; on the mother's side,
from the most illustrious Earls of Roscommon,
being also connected by birth
with the most illustrious Oliver Plunket,
Baron of Louth, first nobleman of the
diocese of Armagh; and in this our
Irish College he devoted himself with
such ardor to philosophy, theology, and
mathematics, that in the Roman College
of the Society of Jesus he was justly
ranked among the foremost in talent,
diligence, and progress in his studies;
these speculative studies being completed,
he pursued with abundant fruit
the course of civil and canon law under
Mark Anthony de Mariscotti, Professor
of the Roman Sapienza, and everywhere
and at all times he was a model
of gentleness, integrity, and piety."</p></blockquote>

<p>Having at length received his ordination
in 1654, Dr. Plunket was
obliged by the rules of the college
either to proceed forthwith on the
Irish mission or to obtain leave from
his superiors to remain to further perfect
his studies. He chose the latter
course, and at his own request the
General of the Society of Jesus, to
whom he applied, permitted him to
enter San Girolamo della Charità,
where for three years he quietly devoted
himself to the accumulation of
knowledge and the duties of his sacred
calling. Marangoni, in his life
of Father Cacciaguerra, speaks of
Doctor Plunket's conduct while in
that secluded retreat in the following
eulogistic terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Here it is incredible with what zeal
he burned for the salvation of souls. In
the house itself, and in the city, he
wholly devoted himself to devout exercises;
frequently did he visit the sanctuaries
steeped with the blood of so
many martyrs, and he ardently sighed for
the opportunity of sacrificing himself for
the salvation of his countrymen. He,
moreover, frequented the Hospital of
Santo Spirito, and employed himself
even in the most abject ministrations,
serving the poor infirm, to the edification
and wonder of the officials and assistants
of that place."</p></blockquote>

<p>The disturbed condition of his
native country has been alleged as
the cause of Dr. Plunket's delay in
Rome, and this in itself would be
sufficient reason, if we reflect that at
that time the soldiers of Cromwell
were in full possession of every nook
and corner of it, and that hundreds
of priests, left without congregations,
were obliged to fly for their lives to
the Continent, or to seek refuge in
mountains and morasses; but it is
more than probable that the young
ecclesiastic had an additional motive
for remaining longer in the
Holy City, and, having a forecast of
his future eminence in the church,
and of the vast benefits he was
capable of rendering to the cause
of religion and his country, desired,
as far as possible, to qualify himself
for the glorious task to which he was
afterwards assigned at the fountain-head
of Catholicity, before undertaking
a labor which he must have
known would be accompanied by
many trials and dangers.</p>

<p>But even from the seclusion of San
Girolamo his fame as an accomplished
and profound scholar soon spread
to the outer world, and in 1657 Dr.
Plunket was appointed professor of
theology and controversy in the College
of the Propaganda, a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
which he held with great credit for
twelve years, until his departure from
Rome. Though thus occupied in
the responsible and laborious duties
of his professorship, he was also consultor
of the Sacred Congregation of
the Index and of other congregations.
In the performance of the high trusts
thus imposed upon him, the young
professor was frequently brought in
contact with many of the most exalted
personages of the Roman Court,
some of whom subsequently filled the
chair of St. Peter, from all of whom
he experienced the greatest kindness
and repeated proofs of affection, as
he frequently mentions with gratitude
in his correspondence. Still the confidence
reposed in him and the companionship
of so many holy and erudite
men failed to satisfy the cravings
of his soul or reconcile him to his enforced
exile. Of a highly sensitive
and even poetic nature, his patriotism
and attachment to his family
were second only to his love for
learning and religion, and his mind
was constantly tormented by the accounts
daily received in Rome of
the barbarities practised on his compatriots
and co-religionists by the licentious
soldiery of the English Commonwealth.
In writing to Father
Spada, in 1656, on the occasion of
the death of his friend and counsellor
Father Scarampo, he exclaims in
the bitterness of his spirit:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"God alone knows how afflicting his
death is to me, especially at the present
time, when all Ireland is overrun and laid
waste by heresy. Of my relations, some
are dead, others have been sent into exile,
and all Ireland is reduced to extreme
misery: this overwhelmed me with an inexpressible
sadness, for I am now deprived
of father and of friends, and I should
die through grief were I not consoled by
the consideration that I have not altogether
lost Father Scarampo; for I may
say that he in part remains, our good God
having retained your reverence in life,
who, as it is known to all, were united
with him in friendship and in charity and
in disposition, so as even to desire to
be his companion in death, from which,
though God preserved you, yet he did
not deprive you of its merit."</p></blockquote>

<p>But, notwithstanding his own afflictions,
he was ever ready to succor
by his slender purse and powerful
influence such of his destitute young
countrymen who sought an opportunity
in Rome to procure an education,
of which they were so systematically
deprived at home; and it was
doubtless from a just perception of his
great repute and thorough acquaintance
with ecclesiastical affairs in
Rome that, in the early part of 1669,
he was requested by the Irish bishops
to act as their representative at the
Papal Court, an office which he
cheerfully accepted and filled to the
entire satisfaction of his venerable
constituency.</p>

<p>But he was not long allowed to
occupy this subordinate position in
connection with the church in Ireland,
nor even to retain his chair in
the Propaganda. He had now entered
on his fortieth year, his mind
fully developed and stored with all
the sacred and profane learning befitting
one called to a higher destiny,
and his soul imbued with a zeal so
holy and so far removed from worldly
ambition that no temptation was
likely to overcome his faith, and no
persecution, no matter how severe, to
shake his constancy. He was therefore
appointed Archbishop of Armagh
and Primate of all Ireland, to succeed
Dr. Edmond O'Reilly, recently
deceased in Paris. Like the great
apostle of his country, of whom he
was about to become the spiritual
successor, he had spent a long probation
in the society of men remarkable
for the purity of their lives and
the extent of their knowledge, and
as St. Patrick longed to revisit the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
land of his adoption, he also yearned
to be once again among the Irish
people. Yet his appointment to the
primacy of Ireland was neither sought
nor anticipated by Dr. Plunket at
this time, as we learn from a letter
from the Archbishop of Dublin to
Monsignor Baldeschi, Secretary of
the Propaganda, in which he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Certainly, no one could be appointed
better suited than Dr. Oliver Plunket,
whom I myself would have proposed in
the first place, were it not that he had
written to me, stating his desire not to
enter for some years in the Irish mission,
until he should have completed some
works which he was preparing for the
press."</p></blockquote>

<p>The names of many clergymen
distinguished for piety, devotion, and
learning had been forwarded to
Rome, from which to select a fitting
successor to Dr. O'Reilly; but, while
their various merits were under discussion,
the Holy Father, Clement
IX., it is said, simplified the matter
by suggesting Dr. Plunket as the person
best qualified to fill the vacant
see, and to govern by his experience
and force of character the hierarchy,
and, through it, the priesthood of
Ireland. The views of the Pope met
with unanimous approval, and, the
selection being thus made, it was out
of the power of Dr. Plunket, no matter
how diffident he might have been
of his own abilities to fill so elevated
a position, to decline. We have
seen how this important decision of
the Sacred Congregation was viewed
by Dr. Talbot, of Dublin, and his
opinions seemed to have been shared
by all the bishops and priests in Ireland.
Dr. O'Molony, of St. Sulpice,
Paris, afterwards Bishop of Killaloe,
writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You have already laid the foundations
of our edifice, erected the pillars,
and given shepherds to feed the sheep
and the lambs; but, now that the work
should not remain imperfect, you have
crowned the edifice, and provided a pastor
for the pastors themselves, appointing
the Archbishop of Armagh, for it is
not of the diocese of Armagh alone that
he has the administration, to whom the
primacy and guardianship of all Ireland
is entrusted. One, therefore, in a thousand
had to be chosen, suited to bear so
great a burden. That one you have
found&mdash;one than whom none other better
or more pleasing could be found; with
whom (that your wise solicitude for our
distracted and afflicted country should
be wanting in nothing) you have been
pleased to associate his suffragan of
Ardagh, a most worthy and grave man."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bishop of Ferns, also, in
addressing the Secretary of the Sacred
Congregation, says: "Applauding
and rejoicing, I have hastened
hither from Gand, to the Most
Reverend and Illustrious Internunzio
of Belgium, to return all possible
thanks to our Holy Father,
in the name of my countrymen, for
having crowned with the mitre of
Armagh the noble and distinguished
Oliver Plunket, Doctor of Theology;"
and Dr. Dowley, of Limerick, adds,
"Most pleasing to all was the appointment
of Dr. Plunket, and I
doubt not it will be agreeable to the
government, to the secular clergy, and
to the nobility."</p>

<p>These warm expressions of esteem
and regard, if known to the new primate,
must have inspired him with
renewed courage to accept the grave
responsibilities imposed upon him,
and truly, if ever man required the
support of friends to nerve him to
encounter dangers and unheard-of
opposition, he did. But he seems to
have had within himself a courage
not of this world, but superior to all
earthly considerations. It is recorded
on the very best authority that,
when about to leave Rome, he was
thus accosted by an aged priest,
"My lord, you are now going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
shed your blood for the Catholic
faith." To which he replied, "I am
unworthy of such a favor; nevertheless,
aid me with your prayers, that
this my desire may be fulfilled."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
The condition of the country to
which the primate was hastening fully
justified this prophecy. It was to
the last degree forlorn and full of
discouragement. The sufferings of
the Irish people at this period defy
description; and were it not that we
have before us the penal acts of parliament,
numerous authenticated state
papers, and the published statements
of some of the highest officials of
the crown and the agents of the
Commonwealth, we would be inclined
to believe, if only for the credit
of human nature, that the relation
of the atrocities at this time perpetrated
by English authority on the
Catholics of Ireland was the work
of some diseased mind that delighted
in horrors and revelled in the contemplation
of an imaginary pandemonium.
The Tudors and the Stuarts
as persecutors of Catholics were
bad enough, but their ineffectual
fires paled before the cool atrocity
and sanctimonious villany of the
followers of Cromwell; men, if we
must call them such, who, arrogating
to themselves not only the honorable
title of champions of human liberty,
but claiming to be the exemplars of
all that was left of what was pure
and holy in this wicked world, perpetrated
in the name of freedom and
religion a series of such deeds of
darkness that not even a parallel can
be found for them in the annals of
the worst days of the Roman emperors.
So deep indeed has the detestation
of the barbarities of Cromwell
taken root in the popular mind of
Ireland, that, though more than two
centuries have elapsed since his
death, his name is as thoroughly and
as heartily detested there to-day as
if his crimes had been committed in
our own generation. Previous to
the Reformation, though wars were
frequent and oftentimes bloody between
the English invaders and the
natives, they were generally conducted
in a certain spirit of chivalry and
with some degree of moderation,
which usually characterize hostile
Catholic nations even in times of
the greatest excitement. Churches
and the nurseries of learning and charity
were respected, or, if destroyed
through the stern necessities of warfare,
were apt to be replaced by others.
But the followers of the new
religion knew no such charitable
weakness, for from the first they
seemed actuated, probably as a punishment
for their sin of wilful rebellion
against the authority of God's
law, with an unquenchable hatred
of everything holy, and a craftiness
in devising measures to destroy the
faith and pervert the minds of the
Catholics so preternatural in its ingenuity
that we can only account
for it by supposing it the emanation
of the enemy of mankind. That
any people stripped of all worldly
possessions, debarred so long from
religious worship and the means of
enlightenment, outlawed by the so-called
government, ensnared by the
spy and the magistrate, and ground
to dust beneath the hoofs of the
trooper's horse, should not only have
preserved their existence and the
faith, but have multiplied amazingly,
both at home and abroad, is one of
the most remarkable incidents in all
history, as well as one of the strongest
proofs of the enduring and unconquerable
spirit of Catholicity.</p>

<p>There were probably at this time
in Ireland nearly a million and a
half of Catholics, though Sir William
Petty estimates their number at about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
1,200,000; the native population
having been fearfully reduced by the
late war and the pestilence and famine
which succeeded it, by the emigration
of forty or fifty thousand
able-bodied men to Spain and other
countries, and by the deportation of
an equal number of women and children,
as slaves, to the West Indies
and the British settlements on our
Atlantic coast. Yet, notwithstanding
the immense loss of life occasioned
soon after by the Williamite war,
the constant drain on the adult male
population in the latter part of the
seventeenth and the first half of the
eighteenth centuries, to fill up the
decimated ranks of the Catholic armies
of Europe, amounting, it is said,
to three-quarters of a million, the
periodical famines to which the peasantry
were constantly exposed, and
the great famine of 1846-7 and
1848, which swept away at least two
millions, the Irish Catholics of to-day
and their descendants in all quarters
of the globe number at least fifteen
million souls. It is a singular
and interesting fact that the Irish
Catholics resident in London out-number
the entire population of the
city of Dublin; that in the cities and
towns of England and Scotland there
are more Catholics of Irish birth than
existed in every part of the world
two hundred years ago; and that,
while the children of St. Patrick count
nearly five millions on the soil which
he redeemed from paganism, many
more millions of them and their descendants
born within the present
century are planting the cross of
Christ everywhere in America and
Australasia. This indestructibility
of the Irish race seems to have raised
an insurmountable barrier against
the designs of the reformers. James
I. having planted part of Ulster
with some success, the Long Parliament
determined to follow his example
on a more comprehensive scale,
and to utterly exterminate the people
who persisted in adhering to their
ancient faith. Accordingly, in 1654,
all Catholics were ordered under the
severest penalties to remove before a
certain day from the provinces of Ulster,
Leinster, and Munster, and take
up their abodes in Connaught, the least
fertile and most inaccessible division
of the island. In their front a strip
of land some miles in width, following
the sinuosity of the sea-coast, and
another in their rear along the line
of the Shannon, were reserved for
the victors and protected by a cordon
of military posts, the penalty
of passing which, without special license,
was death. Thus encompassed
by the stormy Atlantic and the
broad river, with an inner belt of
hostile settlements, it was fondly hoped
that the remnant of the gallant
Irish nation, completely segregated
from the world, would speedily perish,
unnoticed and unknown, among
the sterile mountains of the west.
A more diabolical attempt on the
lives of a whole people is not to be
found recorded in either ancient or
modern history, and, to do but justice
to the canting fanatics who conceived
the plan, no means were left
untried to carry it out to a successful
issue. But Providence, with whose
designs the Cromwellians assumed
to be well acquainted, decreed otherwise,
and no sooner had their leader
sunk into a dishonored grave, and
the legitimate sovereign been restored
to the throne, than every part of
the country swarmed again with Catholics,
who seemed to spring, as if
by magic, from the very soil. The
people, it was found, had actually
increased in numbers, and the clergy,
who it was supposed had been effectually
destroyed by expatriation,
famine, or the sword, still amounted
to over sixteen hundred seculars and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
regulars, as devoted as ever to the
spiritual interests of their flocks.</p>

<p>The restoration of Charles II. in
1660 was hailed by the Catholics as
a favorable omen. They had faithfully
supported his father, and had
lost all in defending his own cause,
and hence they naturally expected,
if not gratitude, at least simple justice.
But Charles was a true Stuart.
Opposed to persecution from a constitutional
love of ease and pleasure,
as much as from any innate sense of
right, he had neither the capacity to
plan a reform nor the manhood to
carry out the tolerant designs of others.
He was, moreover, weak-minded,
vacillating, and insincere, more
disposed to conciliate his enemies by
gifts and honors than to reward his
well-tried friends by the commonest
acts of justice. The greatest favor
that the Catholics could obtain was
a toleration of their worship in remote
and secret places, and even
this qualified boon was dependent on
the whim of the viceroy, and was
soon withdrawn at the command of
parliament.</p>

<p>But the evils of the English Protestant
system did not stop here. The
death or involuntary exile of most of
the Irish bishops and the dispersion
of the clergy created a relaxation of
ecclesiastical discipline, particularly
among the regulars, and the impossibility
of obtaining proper religious instruction
at home, and the difficulty
of procuring it elsewhere, necessarily
lowered the standard of education
among the priests of all ranks. Left
for the most part to their own guidance,
and only imperfectly trained
for the ministry, many friars, particularly
of the Order of St. Francis, so
illustrious for its many distinguished
scholars and eloquent preachers,
were disposed to rebel against their
superiors when the least restraint was
placed upon their irregular modes of
living, and some were found base
enough to lend the weight attached
to their sacred calling to further the
designs of the worst enemies of their
creed and country. Ormond and
other so-called statesmen, while avowing
unqualified loyalty to their sovereign
and a secret attachment to the
church, were insidiously betraying
the one by placing him in a false
position before Catholics and Protestants,
while vainly endeavoring to
strike a blow at the other by using
these apostates to create a schism in
her ranks. In the latter scheme they
signally failed, and their defeat was
mainly due to the untiring energy
and profound foresight of the Archbishop
of Armagh during the ten
years of his administration. The
very announcement of Dr. Plunket's
appointment seems to have struck
terror into the secret enemies of the
church in Ireland, and to have given
new hope to the friends of religion.
This event occurred on the 9th of
July, 1669, when the bulls for his consecration
were immediately forwarded
to the Internunzio at Brussels. Dr.
Plunket was desirous of receiving the
mitre in Rome, and even made a
strong request to be granted that
privilege, but the prudential motives
which induced the Sacred Congregation
to select Belgium in the first instance
still remained, and the favor
was reluctantly refused. As his first
act of obedience, the archbishop
bowed cheerfully to this decision,
and after presenting his little vineyard,
his only real property, and a
few books to the Irish College, he
bade a final adieu to his Roman
friends in the following month, and
commenced his homeward journey&mdash;his
first step to a glorious immortality.
He arrived during November in the
capital of Belgium, and was cordially
welcomed by the Internunzio,
who was not unacquainted with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
extensive learning and unaffected
piety. At the request of that prelate,
the Bishop of Ghent consented
to administer consecration to Dr.
Plunket, and the solemn ceremony was
duly performed on the 30th of November,
in the private chapel of the
episcopal palace in that ancient city.
Dr. Nicholas French, Bishop of
Ferns, one of the few persons present
on the occasion, thus describes it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I present a concise narrative of the
consecration of the most illustrious Archbishop
of Armagh. His excellency the
Internunzio wrote most kind letters to
the bishop of this diocese requesting him
to perform it, and he most readily acquiesced.
But I, on receiving this news,
set out at once for Brussels to conduct
hither his Grace of Armagh, bound by
gratitude to render him this homage. A
slight fever seized our excellent bishop
on the Saturday before the Twenty-fourth
Sunday after Pentecost, which had
been fixed for Dr. Plunket's consecration;
wherefore that ceremony was
deferred till the first Sunday in
Advent, on which day it was devoutly
and happily performed in the
capella of the palace, without noise, and
with closed doors, for such was the desire
of the Archbishop of Armagh. Remaining
here for eight days after his consecration,
he passed his time in despatching
letters and examining my writings."</p></blockquote>

<p>After this short delay, the Primate
continued his journey, stopping long
enough in London to see his friends
at the English court, and to present
his credentials to the Queen, who
was a devout Catholic, and who received
him with great cordiality.
He had also leisure to become somewhat
conversant with the policy and
views of the leading public characters
in the English capital, and to
study the workings and temper of the
parliament. After a tedious and
fatiguing journey, he at length landed
in Ireland, in March, 1670, having
been absent from that country a
quarter of a century, where he was
joyously received by his numerous
relatives and friends. Great was the
change which had been wrought in
his life during those twenty-five years,
but, alas! how much greater had
been the alteration in the circumstances
of his countrymen. As a
lad he had left them in the full enjoyment
of their religion in almost
every part of the island, their nobility
in the possession of their estates, the
peasantry and farmers prosperous,
the clergy respected and freely obeyed,
and all full of hope for the future,
and sanguine of yet attaining their
independence. As an archbishop
and primate, he returned to find nothing
but desolation and ruin, sorrow
and dejection. The nobility had
either been banished or reduced to
the condition of mere tenants on
their own property, so that only three
Catholic gentlemen in the province
of Armagh, which embraces eleven
dioceses, held any real estate; the
original cultivators of the soil who
had been spared by the sword and
had not been transported or compelled
to emigrate were formed into
bands of plunderers, and infested the
highways under the name of <i>tories</i>,
while such as remained of the bishops
and clergy were to be found
only in bogs and mountains or in
the most obscure portions of the
larger towns and cities.</p>

<p>Undaunted by the scenes of woe
and destruction around him, the Primate,
like a diligent servant of God,
had no sooner set foot on his native
soil than he proceeded to the performance
of his pastoral labors. Writing
to Cardinal Barberini, Protector
of Ireland, an account of his journey
from Rome, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I afterwards arrived in Ireland in the
month of March, and hastened immediately
to my residence; and I held two
synods and two ordinations, and in a
month and a-half I administered confirmation
to more than ten thousand persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
though throughout my province I
think there yet remain more than fifty
thousand persons to be confirmed. I remarked
throughout the country, wherever
I went, that for every heretic there
are twenty Catholics. The new viceroy
is a man of great moderation; he willingly
receives the Catholics, and he treats
privately with the ecclesiastics, and promises
them protection while they attend
to their own functions without intriguing
in the affairs of government."</p></blockquote>

<p>The nobleman here alluded to was
Lord Berkeley, who held office in
Ireland for a few years, and under
whose politic and tolerant, if not
very sincere, administration the Catholics
enjoyed at least comparative
security. Personally, he, as well as
his successor, Lord Essex, entertained
a very high respect for the primate,
and treated him with great kindness,
when it was possible to do so without
incurring the displeasure of the
ultra-Protestant faction. Indeed,
Archbishop Plunket, well aware of
the difficulties which constantly beset
his path, and feeling the futility
of defying the government authorities,
set his mind from the first to
conciliate those whom he knew had
the power to thwart or second his efforts,
without yielding anything of
his episcopal dignity or compromising
his character as an ardent patriot.
His long probationary course in
Rome and his intimate association
with so many of the best and most
accomplished minds at the Papal
court must have eminently qualified
him for dealing with the leading British
officials in Ireland. In his voluminous
correspondence with the
Holy See, he frequently alludes to
his interviews with the lord-lieutenant
and other noblemen, and to
the judicious use he was able to
make of his influence with them for
the benefit of his less fortunate or
more demonstrative brethren in the
ministry. In a letter addressed to
Pope Clement, dated June 20, 1670,
he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our viceroy is a man of great moderation
and equity: he looks on the Catholics
with benevolence, and treats privately
with some of the clergy, exhorting
them to act with discretion; and for this
purpose he secretly called me to his presence
on many occasions, and promised
me his assistance in correcting any members
of the clergy of scandalous life.
I discover in him some spark of religion,
and I find that many even of the leading
members of his court are secretly Catholics."</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, to Dr. Brennan, his successor
as Irish agent, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the province of Armagh, the clergy
and Catholics enjoy a perfect peace. The
Earl of Charlemont, being friendly with
me, defends me in every emergency. Being
once in the town of Dungannon to
administer confirmation, and the governor
of the place having prevented me from
doing so, the earl not only severely reproved
the governor, but told me to go
to his own palace, when I pleased, to
give confirmation or to say Mass there if
I wished. The magistrate of the city of
Armagh, having made an order to the effect
that all Catholics should accompany
him to the heretical service every Sunday,
under penalty of half-a-crown per head
for each time they would absent themselves,
I appealed to the president of the
province against this decree, and he cancelled
it, and commanded that neither
clergy nor Catholic laity should be molested."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not, however, to be supposed
from these isolated instances of
toleration that the new primate was
allowed the full exercise of his functions
in the land of his nativity, and
where his flock so vastly outnumbered
their opponents. On the contrary,
we learn from a letter of Lord
Conway to his brother-in-law, Sir
George Rawdon, that even before
Dr. Plunket reached Ireland orders
had been issued by the lord-lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
for his arrest as being one of
"two persons sent from Rome, that
lie lurking in the country to do mischief;"
and even when he had taken
possession of his see, his labors for
the most part were performed in secret
or in the night time. This was
more particularly so after 1673, when
the persecution was renewed against
the Catholics, that we have his own
authority and that of his companion
in suffering, Dr. Brennan, Bishop of
Waterford, for saying that at the
most tempestuous times he was obliged
to seek safety by flight, and frequently
to expose himself to the horrors
of a northern winter and almost
to starvation in order to be amid his
people, and ready to administer spiritual
consolation to them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The viceroy," he says, writing in January,
1664, "on the 10th or thereabouts
of this month, published a further proclamation
that the registered clergy
should be treated with the greatest rigor.
Another but secret order was given to
all the magistrates and sheriffs that the
detectives should seek out, both in the
cities and throughout the country, the
other bishops and regulars. I and my
companions no sooner received intelligence
of this than, on the 18th of this
month, which was Sunday, after vespers,
being the festival of the Chair of St. Peter,
we deemed it necessary to take to
our heels; the snow fell heavily mixed
with hail-stones, which were very hard
and large; a cutting north wind blew in
our faces, and the snow and hail beat so
dreadfully in our eyes that to the present
we have been scarcely able to see with
them. Often we were in danger in the
valleys of being lost and suffocated in
the snow, till at length we arrived at the
house of a reduced gentleman, who had
nothing to lose; but for our misfortune
he had a stranger in his house, by whom
we did not wish to be recognized; hence
we were placed in a large garret without
chimney and without fire, where we have
been during the past eight days. May it
redound to the glory of God, the salvation
of our souls, and the flocks entrusted
to our charge!"</p></blockquote>

<p>So great indeed was the danger
of discovery at this time, and so
watchful were the emissaries of the
law, that he was compelled to write
most of his foreign letters over the
assumed signature of "Mr. Thomas
Cox," and was usually addressed by
that name in reply. He even tells
us that he was sometimes obliged to
go about the performance of his duties
in the disguise of a cavalier with
cocked hat and sword.</p>

<p>Dr. Plunket is represented by his
contemporaries as a man of delicate
physical organization, highly sensitive
in his temperament, and disposed
naturally to prefer the seclusion of
the closet to the excitement and turmoil
of the world. The contrast between
the scholastic retirement in
which he had spent so many years
of his life, and the circumstances by
which he now found himself surrounded,
must have been indeed striking,
but like a true disciple he did
not hesitate a moment in entering on
his new sphere of usefulness. Shortly
after his arrival in Dublin, on the
17th of June, 1670, he called together
and presided over a general synod
of the Irish bishops, at which several
important statutes were passed,
as well as an address to the new viceroy
declaring the loyalty and homage,
in all things temporal, of the
hierarchy of Ireland to the reigning
sovereign. Two synods of his own
clergy had already been held, and
in September following a provincial
council of Ulster met at Clones, which
not only reaffirmed the decrees of
the synod of Dublin, but enacted
many long required reforms in discipline
and the manner of life of the
clergy. In a letter from the assembled
clergy of the province of Armagh,
date October 8, 1670, and addressed
to Monsignor Baldeschi, they thus
speak of the untiring labors of their
metropolitan:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the diocese of Armagh, Kilmore,
Clogher, Derry, Down, Connor, and Dromore,
although far separated from each
other, he administered confirmation to
thousands in the woods and mountains,
heedless of winds and rain. Lately, too,
he achieved a work from which great advantage
will be derived by the Catholic
body, for there were many of the more noble
families who had lost their properties,
and, being proclaimed outlaws in public
edicts, were subsequently guilty of many
outrages; those by his admonitions he
brought back to a better course; he moreover
obtained pardon for their crimes,
and not only procured this pardon for
themselves, but also for their receivers,
and thus hundreds and hundreds of Catholic
families have been freed from imminent
danger to their body and soul and
properties."</p></blockquote>

<p>But the good pastor was not contented
with these extended labors
among the laity. To make his reforms
permanent and beneficial, he
felt that he should commence with
the clergy, who as a body had always
been faithful to their sacred
trust, but, owing to the disturbed state
of the country for so many years past,
had been unable to perform their allotted
duties with that exactness and
punctuality so desirable in the presence
of a watchful and unscrupulous
enemy. He therefore ordained
many young students, whom he found
qualified for the ministry, and, taking
advantage of the temporary cessation
of espionage consequent on the arrival
of Lord Berkeley, he established a
college in Drogheda, in which he soon
had one hundred and sixty pupils
and twenty-five ecclesiastics, under
the care of three learned Jesuit fathers.
The expenses of this school
he defrayed out of his slender means,
never more than sixty pounds per
annum, and frequently not one-fifth
of that sum, with the exception of
150 scudi (less than forty pounds
sterling), annually allowed by the
Sacred Congregation of Propaganda.
When, in 1674, the penal laws were
again put in force in all their original
ferocity of spirit, the college was of
course broken up; but Dr. Plunket in
his letters to Rome was never tired
of impressing on the minds of the authorities
there the necessity of affording
Irish students more ample facilities
for affording a thorough education.
His suggestions in regard to
the Irish College at Rome, by which
a larger number of students might be
accommodated without increased expense,
though not acted upon at the
time, have since been carried out,
and it was principally at his instance
that the Irish institutions in Spain,
previously monopolized by young
men from certain dioceses of Ireland
only, were thrown open to all.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1671, we find
Dr. Plunket on a mission to the Hebrides,
where the people, the descendants
of the ancient Irish colonists,
still preserved their Gaelic language,
and received him with all the gratitude
and enthusiasm of the Celtic nature.
In 1674, notwithstanding the
storm of persecution then raging over
the island, he made a lengthy tour
through the province of Tuam, and in
the following year we have a detailed
report of his visitation to the
eleven dioceses in his own province,
every one of which, no matter how
remote or what was the personal
risk, he took pains to inspect, bringing
peace and comfort in his footsteps,
and leaving behind him the
tears and prayers of his appreciative
children.</p>

<p>If we add to this multiplicity of occupations
the further one of being
the chief and almost only regular
correspondent of the Sacred Congregation
of Propaganda in the three
kingdoms, we may presume that the
primate's life in Ireland was fully and
advantageously occupied. The number
of his letters to Rome on every subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
of importance is immense, when
we consider the difficulty and danger
of communication in those days. He
was also in constant correspondence
with London, Paris, and Brussels,
and, though he sometimes complains
of the weakness of his eyesight, caused
doubtless by exposure and change
of climate, he frequently regrets more
his poverty, which did not enable
him to pay the postage on all occasions.
At one time, indeed, he avers
that all the food he is able to procure
for himself is "a little oaten
bread and some milk and water."</p>

<p>The last important act of the primate
was the convocation of a provincial
synod at Ardpatrick, in August,
1678, at which were present the
bishops or vicars-general and apostolic
of all the dioceses of Ulster.
Many decrees of a general and special
nature were there passed with great
solemnity, and upon being sent to
Rome were duly approved. It was
upon this occasion that the representatives
of the suffragan diocese of
Armagh, deeply impressed and edified
as they were by the labors and
sanctity of their archbishop, addressed
a joint letter to the Sacred Congregation,
eloquently describing the
extent and good effect of his constant
solicitude for his spiritual charge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We therefore declare (say those venerable
men) that the aforesaid Most Illustrious
Metropolitan has labored much,
exercising his sacred functions not only
in his own but also in other dioceses; during
the late persecution he abandoned not
the flock entrusted to him, though he
was exposed to extreme danger of losing
his life; he erected schools, and provided
masters and teachers, that the clergy and
youth might be instructed in literature,
piety, cases of conscience, and other
matters relating to their office; he held
two provincial councils, in which salutary
decrees were enacted for the reformation
of morals; he, moreover, rewarded the
good and punished the bad, as far as circumstances
and the laws of the kingdom
allowed; he labored much, and not
without praise, in preaching the word
of God; he instructed the people by
word and example; he also exercised
hospitality so as to excite the admiration
of all, although he scarcely received
annually two hundred crowns
from his diocese; and he performed all
other things which became an archbishop
and metropolitan, as far as they
could be done in this kingdom. In fine,
to our great service and consolation, he
renewed, or rather established anew,
at great expense, correspondence with
the Holy See, which, for many years before
his arrival, had become extinct. For
all which things we acknowledge ourselves
indebted to his Holiness and to
your Eminences, who, by your solicitude
provided for us so learned and vigilant a
metropolitan, and we shall ever pray the
Divine Majesty to preserve his holiness
and your Eminences."</p></blockquote>

<p>Had the distinguished body of ecclesiastics
who thus voluntarily testified
to the merits of their archbishop
anticipated the awful catastrophe that
was soon to remove him from them
and from the world, they could not
have epitomized his career in more
truthful and concise language for
the benefit of posterity. The end,
however, was now at hand. In the
same year that the provincial synod
was held, the persecution against the
Catholics, intermittent like those of
the early ages of the church, broke
out with redoubled violence. Forced
to the most extreme measures by the
parliament, the English court sent
the strictest orders to Ireland to
have arrested and removed from the
country the entire body of the bishops
and the clergy. The statute of
2d Elizabeth, declaring it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmunire</i>
or imprisonment and confiscation
for any person to exercise the authority
of bishop or priest in her dominions,
was revived, and liberal rewards
for the discovery of such offenders
were publicly offered, to stimulate
the energy of that class of
spies known as "priest-hunters."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
Dr. Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin,
was arrested and thrown into prison,
where during a long confinement he
languished and finally died. Dr.
Creagh, Bishop of Limerick, the
Archbishop of Tuam, and several of
the inferior clergy, were also imprisoned
and subjected to many annoyances
and indignities previous to
being expelled the kingdom. Dr.
Plunket, who hoped that the storm
would soon blow over, while prudently
seeking a place of safety in a
remote part of his diocese, frequently
avowed his determination never to
forsake his flock until compelled to
do so by superior force. Learning,
however, of the dangerous illness of
his relative and former patron, Dr.
Patrick Plunket, he cautiously left
his concealment, and hastened to
Dublin, to be with the good old
bishop during his last moments, and
it was in that city, on the 6th of December,
1679, that he was discovered
and apprehended by order of the
viceroy. For the first six months
after his arrest he was confined in
Dublin Castle, part of the time a
close prisoner, but, as the only charge
openly preferred against him was, to
use the expression of one of his relatives,
"only for being a Catholic
bishop, and for not having abandoned
the flock of our Lord in obedience
to the edict published by parliament,"
and as the punishment for
this at the worst was expatriation,
his friends did not fear for his life.
They were not aware then that a
conspiracy had been formed against
him by some apostate friars under
the patronage of the infamous Earl
of Shaftesbury, the leader of the
English fanatics, with the object of
accusing him of high treason, and
thus compassing his death. On the
24th of July following, he was sent under
guard to Dundalk for trial; but so
monstrous were the charges of treason
against him, and so thoroughly was
his character for moderation and
loyalty known to all, that, though the
jury consisted exclusively of Protestants,
his accusers dared not appear
against him, and he was consequently
remitted back to Dublin.
But his enemies on both sides of the
Channel were thirsting for his blood,
and, in October, 1680, he was removed
to London, ostensibly to answer
before the king and parliament,
but, actually, to undergo the mockery
of a trial in a country in which
no offense was even alleged to have
been committed, where the infamous
character of his accusers was unknown,
and where he was completely
isolated from his friends. The result
could not be doubtful. Without
counsel or witnesses, in the presence
of prejudiced judges and perjured
witnesses, and surrounded by the hooting
of a London mob, he was found
guilty, and, on the 14th of June,
1681, he was sentenced to be executed
at Tyburn, a judgment which
was carried out on the 11th of July
following, with all the barbaric ceremonies
of the period. During the
trial and on the scaffold, his bearing
was singularly noble and courageous,
so much so, indeed, that many who
beheld him, and who shared the
violent anti-Catholic prejudices of
the hour, were satisfied of his perfect
innocence. He repeatedly and emphatically
denied all complicity in
the treasonable plots laid to his
charge, but openly declared that he
had acted as a Catholic bishop, and
had spent many years of his life in
preaching and teaching God's word
to his countrymen. His life in
prison between the passing and the
execution of the sentence is best described
by a fellow-prisoner, the
learned Benedictine, Father Corker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
who had the privilege of being with
him in his last hours. In his narrative,
he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He continually endeavored to improve
and advance himself in the purity
of divine love, and by consequence also
in contrition for his sins past; of his deficiency
in both which this humble soul
complained to me as the only thing that
troubled him. This love had extinguished
in him all fear of death. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Perfecta charitas
foras mittit timorem</i>: a lover feareth
not, but rejoiceth at the approach of the
beloved. Hence, the joy of our holy
martyr seemed still to increase with his
danger, and was fully accomplished by
an assurance of death. The very night
before he died, being now, as it were, at
heart's ease, he went to bed at eleven
o'clock, and slept quietly and soundly
till four in the morning, at which time
his man, who lay in the room with him,
awaked him; so little concern had he
upon his spirit, or, rather, so much had
the loveliness of the end beautified the
horror of the passage to it. After he
certainly knew that God Almighty had
chosen him to the crown and dignity of
martyrdom, he continually studied how
to divest himself of himself, and become
more and more an entire and perfect holocaust,
to which end, as he gave up his
soul, with all its faculties, to the conduct
of God, so, for God's sake, he resigned
the care and disposal of his body to unworthy
me, etc. But I neither can nor
dare undertake to describe unto you the
signal virtues of this blessed martyr.
There appeared in him something beyond
expression&mdash;something more than
human; the most savage and hard-hearted
people were mollified and attendered
at his sight."</p></blockquote>

<p>About two years afterward, this
pious clergyman, upon being liberated,
disinterred the body of the late primate,
and had it forwarded to the
convent of his order at Lambspring
in Germany; the trunk and legs he
had buried in the churchyard attached
to that institution, and the right
arm and head he preserved in separate
reliquaries. The former is still
preserved in the Benedictine Convent;
the latter is in Dundalk, in the
Convent of St. Catharine of Sienna,
a nunnery founded by the favorite
niece of the martyred prelate.</p>

<p>Dr. Plunket's judicial murder was
the source of great grief to the
friends of the church throughout Europe,
and even many contemporary
Protestant writers expressed their regret
at his unmerited sufferings, while
the unfortunate agents of his death,
becoming outcasts and wanderers, generally
ended their lives on the scaffold
or in abject poverty, bemoaning
their crimes, to the pity and horror
of Christendom. The memory of Dr.
Plunket, one of the most learned and
heroic of the long line of Irish bishops,
is sacredly and lovingly preserved
in his own country and in the
general annals of the church; and let
us hope, in the language of the Rev.
Monsignor Moran, who has done so
much by his researches to perpetuate
the name and fame of his glorious
countryman, "that the day is not
now far distant when our long-afflicted
church will be consoled with the
solemn declaration of the Vicar of
Christ, that he who, in the hour of
trial, was the pillar of the house of
God in our country, and who so nobly
sealed with his blood the doctrines
of our faith, may be ranked
among the martyrs of our holy
church."</p>

<h2>MARY CLIFFORD'S PROMISE KEPT.</h2>


<p>It was the day after a storm. The
morning had been cool, almost cold;
banks of cloud were piled up on the
horizon; the summits of the friendly
Franconias were shrouded; the White
Mountains were invisible, and the
wind whistled and howled, reminding
one of "the melancholy days" to
come. By afternoon, however, there
was a change. Every cloud had
magically disappeared, the wind had
gone down, fields and young maples
seemed to have renewed their early
green, and everything stood out in
clear relief, bathed and steeped in
September sunshine. Not a red-letter
day, but a golden day; one to be
remembered.</p>

<p>I believe I shall remember it all
my life, even if there should be days as
bright and far happier in store for me.
I was in an open buggy with a gentleman
named Mr. Grey, I driving and
he calling my attention to one thing
after another, and both of us rejoicing
in a light-hearted way in the
sun, and sky, and yellow leaves, and
roadside trees laden with crimson
plums; in the golden-rod, and purple
asters, and the bee-hives, and picturesque,
bare-footed, white-headed
children; and in ourselves and each
other, and in our youth and strength;
and in the sunny present, and the
mysterious, enchanted future.</p>

<p>"I never knew the animal go so
well before," said Mr. Grey; "you
seem to understand how to make
him do his best. Only remember
that the faster we go, the sooner we
shall get home. Will you not sacrifice
your fancy for fast driving, to
my enjoyment of the drive? Give
me time to realize how much I enjoy
it."</p>

<p>"You always seem to feel as if
stopping to think about it will make
the time go slower," I said.</p>

<p>"It does to me, I assure you, at
least at the moment. Yet I do not
find, in looking back, that this past
month has flown any less fast, for all
my little arts to detain it. Here
comes the stage, crowded as usual,
inside and out. I wonder whether
we make a part of the picture to
them, and whether they will remember
us with it? The mountains before
them&mdash;look back, Miss Clifford,
and see; that crimson maple on your
side of the road; and this green hill
with its firs and rocks on mine."</p>

<p>I laughed. "I don't believe they
will ever think of us again."</p>

<p>"Then they are not appreciative.
Don't think I mean to take any of
their supposed notice to myself, except
so far as I am with you. To
me, all the rest, all that we can see
and admire, is the frame, the setting
as it were, to your face. It has been
so ever since I came here."</p>

<p>I found this somewhat embarrassing,
of course, though Mr. Grey spoke in
a simple, matter-of-fact way, that
had the effect of veiling the compliment.
He did not seem to expect
an answer, and continued, "That
reminds me of 'In Memoriam.' Do
you recall the lines about the 'diffusive
power'?"</p>

<p>"No; I don't know what you mean.
Repeat them, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt you will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
them familiar, yet I will repeat them,
because I like them so much." And
he recited these lines, which I write
down, because they bring before me
the whole scene, and I seem to hear
again the low voice and the appreciating
accent with which he spoke:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Thy voice is on the rolling air;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I hear thee where the waters run:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou standest in the rising sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the setting thou art fair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"What art thou, then? I cannot guess;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, though I seem in star and flower<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To feel thee some diffusive power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do not therefore love thee less.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"My love involves the love before;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My love is vaster passion now;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though mixed with God and nature thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to love thee more and more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Far off thou art, but ever nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have thee still, and I rejoice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I prosper, circled with thy voice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall not lose thee, though I die."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Can you imagine feeling so about
any one?" asked Mr. Grey.</p>

<p>"I can imagine it. Do you suppose
that Mr. Tennyson's friend was
really so much to him?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said gravely. "I'll
tell you, Miss Clifford, what I think
about that. It is not right to feel so
about anybody, because that is exactly
the way we ought to feel about
God. Don't you see that it is? If
everything reminded us of him, it
would be just right."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it would be possible
to make God so personal to us.
We think naturally of what we know
and have seen, not of what we merely
believe in."</p>

<p>"Ah! but God may be 'personal
to us,' as you say. You forget that
he is near us, with us, and even in us.
That would be the only way, it seems
to me, of loving him with our mind,
and soul, and strength, because we
can't help loving all this beauty in
everything. Just as Tennyson says,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My love involves the love before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to love thee more and more.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There was a bough of deep-red
leaves overhead, and I looked longingly
at it, for they were just the
color that I liked to wear in my hair;
yet I did not want to ask for it, lest
Mr. Grey should think that I had
not been attending to him. He must
have seen the look, though, for he
jumped out of the buggy and ran
up the bank to get the branch. I
stopped the horse, thinking, as I
watched the capturing of the prize,
"I might have known my wish would
be anticipated. Every one but he
waits to be asked and thanked."
When he came back, I told him I
was tired of driving, and asked him
to take the reins.</p>

<p>"May I spin the drive out?" he
asked. "You are not in a hurry to
have it over, are you? Do you
know it is the only time we have
ever driven together?"</p>

<p>"Why, I thought we had taken a
great many other drives. What are
you thinking of?"</p>

<p>"We have driven often, as you
say, with parties of other people, but
have we ever taken a drive by ourselves
before?"</p>

<p>"No," I returned; "you are right."</p>

<p>"It is a part of the whole," continued
he. "I have been in a kind
of dream for a month. I dread the
awakening, though everything reminds
me of it now. It has been a
new experience to me, this boarding
with other people and seeing them
so familiarly. There is no way of
getting into easy and friendly relations
with others in a very short
space of time so effective as this;
and, as the household has happened
to be a very pleasant one, I have
enjoyed the experiment greatly;
though it is strange to think that I
may never see any of our number
again."</p>

<p>"You are really very flattering,
Mr. Grey," I said, a little hurt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
"Then I am never to see you again!
I am glad you have given me warning,
or I might have invited you to
visit us in Boston, next winter."</p>

<p>"You are kind, very kind," he answered
hastily; "nothing would give
me greater pleasure than to meet
you, but I shall not be in America
next winter. I hope to be in Rome."</p>

<p>"Really!" I exclaimed. "Why
are you going to Rome? To be a
priest?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not so fortunate as to
have that vocation. I am going
abroad to try to find a wife, singular
as it may appear."</p>

<p>"It does seem strange that a man
with such strong American feelings
as you should wish to have a foreign
wife."</p>

<p>"I want to marry a Catholic," he
said, switching off the tops of the
golden-rod with the whip.</p>

<p>"And are there no Catholic wives
to be obtained here?" I asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"No doubt; though I have not
yet found the one I am looking for.
Among converts there are girls who
suffer for their faith, who are called
upon to make sacrifices, to lose position,
and the approbation, even the
affection, of their friends. 'It is so
odd!' they say, 'so unnecessary, to
break away from early associations,
and from forms of worship which
have been sufficient for all their
friends&mdash;and very good people too&mdash;and
embrace a foreign religion.'
Haven't you heard such remarks?"</p>

<p>I acknowledged that I had, adding,
"And I don't wonder at it."</p>

<p>"Among these brave girls," he
continued, not noticing my remark,
"one meets heroism, fervor, and a
practical recommendation of the religion
for which they are proud to
suffer; but I also want to see what
I shall find in other countries&mdash;women
who have grown up in a Catholic
atmosphere, and acquired their
faith unconsciously, as the breath of
their lives. These have developed
into beautiful forms of grace and
piety, as delicate as flowers, and,
like them, breathing innocence and
purity such as no other education
can give or even preserve."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that innocence
and purity cannot be found
among Protestant girls?" I asked
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I am sure I hope they can," he
answered earnestly; "yet do not be
offended if I say, not in the same
degree. You cannot conceive, Miss
Clifford, of the beauty of a soul
which has been guarded and sustained
from infancy by the graces and
sacraments of the church, and has
kept its baptismal whiteness without
stain. It is not often found, even
within the church, and is, I believe,
nearly impossible outside it."</p>

<p>"I hope you'll find this angel next
winter. Please let me know when
you discover her, for I should like to
see her."</p>

<p>He was silent, and as I was thinking
about a good many things, we
drove on very quietly for some time.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that I should
remember so well what Mr. Grey
said to me that golden September
afternoon, and as I think I know the
reason of it, I will write it down as
frankly as I have written the description
of our drive so far, and as I
mean to put down all I recall of it
to the end.</p>

<p>Mr. Grey had boarded for a month
in the same house with me and my
sister, and a dozen other people, all
of whom we met for the first time.
My sister and I were the only persons
whose society he seemed to seek,
and as she, not being strong, was obliged
to keep quiet, I had seen more
of him than any one else. He was
very polite and pleasant to every one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
and the whole household liked him;
yet he never talked to the other ladies
as he did to me, nor paid them
the same watchful little attentions.
He thought me pretty, and had a
curious, unconscious way of alluding
to it that did not seem offensive like
common flattery, and there was a delicacy
and appreciation about his
treatment of me that was original
and very, very pleasant.</p>

<p>True, he was a Catholic, and a
very devout one, having his religious
books and papers always with him,
and talking of his faith with real enjoyment
to any one who showed the
smallest interest. Rose, my sister,
had talked with him once or twice,
and to her he very soon expressed
his disapproval of marriage between
Catholics and non-Catholics (as he
called them), and declared his determination
never to marry at all if he
could not have a Catholic wife.
Rose had alluded to this in my presence,
so he knew that I understood
what his intentions were. On
account of this understanding, there
was more freedom and less constraint
in our intercourse than would otherwise
have been; and as he was a
gentleman, and an educated one, I
found great pleasure in being with
him and in his sympathy. His attentions,
unobtrusive, thoughtful, and
constant, were not only acceptable to
me, but in that short month I had
come to depend upon them more
than I was aware of, forgetting that
when they ceased it would be harder
for me than if I had never received
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Grey had never talked to me
exactly in the way that he did that
afternoon, and because I thought it
unusual I have been able to recall
what he said in nearly his very
words.</p>

<p>We were on our way home, walking
up a long hill, when he said:</p>

<p>"I have thought a good deal of
you lately, and of a feeling I have
had about you from the first&mdash;as if it
were a great merit in you to be so
lovely, and sweet, and charming, and
that any one who felt and appreciated
your loveliness as I have owed
you a kind of debt, as it were, which
it would be an honor and a happiness
to try to pay."</p>

<p>His face was turned from me, and
he trailed the whip-lash in the road,
while I, leaning back, could not help
looking at him, and, because I did
not know what to say, I laughed.</p>

<p>He continued: "Yet with that
thought came the realization of its injustice;
for you cannot help your
prettiness, and you are clever because
it is natural to you; and I thought,
'Now, if I am just, I shall pay my
debt not to her, who did not make
herself, but to God, who made her.
I shall love not only the beauty, but
also the Giver and Perfecter of it.'
Would not that be better, Miss Clifford?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. I understand
what you mean. Only, then, why
have you been so good to me?" I
had to look away, for my voice trembled
and my eyes were suddenly full
of tears.</p>

<p>"Why? Because it has made me
happy, and I have been unjust; because
I have said to myself, 'This is
a dream&mdash;a sweet and charming
dream. Soon I shall wake and go
back to real life; for the present, let
me be weak and enjoy it.'"</p>

<p>The glory of the sunshine was departing,
the hills were in deep shadow,
and the slanting rays were no
longer warm and cheering. Mr. Grey
wrapped my shawl round me, just as
I remembered that I had one in
case I should need it.</p>

<p>When I could speak steadily, I remarked:
"Something that you have
said makes me think of the parable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
of the talents. It has always perplexed
me. Will you tell me if you
think I have a talent, and what I am
to do with it? I don't want to bury
it in the ground."</p>

<p>"Your talents are clear enough, I
am sure," he answered. "Your power
of pleasing and making yourself
loved is one."</p>

<p>"And what am I to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Why, do good with it. You
have done me good."</p>

<p>"Ah! but that is because you are
good, not because I am," I said sadly.</p>

<p>"I am not good, though perhaps
the <em>reason</em> why you have done me
good lies more with me than you.
I don't suppose&mdash;forgive me for saying
it&mdash;that your beauty was given
you only to win men's hearts, because
that does not make them happy, or
better."</p>

<p>"You are thinking, I suppose, of
Mr. Falconer. I am sure I did not
want him to fall in love with me, and
make such a fuss. It was very uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"And don't you think you might
have helped it? Really, now, Miss
Clifford?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I might perhaps have
stopped him if I had been rude and
disagreeable to him."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you are ever that
to any one. You try to please everybody."</p>

<p>"There! that is just it!" I exclaimed.
"Why, isn't that using my talent,
taking for granted I have it?
What ought I to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I know what a Catholic girl
would think of, because Catholics
are taught in all things to acknowledge
God, and to refer all to him.
Think what this gift of beauty is&mdash;the
key to all hearts; it challenges
and receives love as soon as seen.
Don't you feel instantly attracted by
a beautiful face, and turn with pleasure
and affection toward the possessor,
before she has given any evidence
of other claims to be loved?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and for a person who can't
help wanting to please and to be
loved, it is an advantage, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It is more than that, it is the gift
of God; and therefore intended for
good. The saints were in the habit
of saying, 'God created all this beauty
in order to lead me to love him.'
Now, if a woman thinks of this, she
will not prize her beauty for the purposes
of vanity, but to lead her admirers
to something higher than herself.
I grant you this is not common,
nor would a woman think of it, unless
she had been taught to think of
God as the first principle of her life.
But I will not preach any more."</p>

<p>"You remind me of my little 'Mrs.
Barbauld.' How long it is since I
have thought of it! 'The rose is
beautiful; but he that made the rose
is more beautiful than it. It is beautiful;
he is beauty.'"</p>

<p>"I have been unusually serious,
perhaps because I have felt the end
of the dream drawing very near. I am
going away the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>The sunset clouds had faded away,
and the stars were coming out above
our heads. We had reached the top
of one more long hill, and there was
the little meeting-house before us,
and we saw beyond our own white
cottage, with a light in the parlor-window,
showing that tea-time was
passed. Mr. Grey spoke again.</p>

<p>"Have you enjoyed this drive?"</p>

<p>"I have very much."</p>

<p>"Have I said anything to hurt or
offend you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, Mr. Grey. On the
contrary, you have given me something
to think about. No one ever
spoke to me in this way before."</p>

<p>"And do you think you shall be
likely to remember this afternoon?
and with pleasure?"</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall not be likely to forget it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I have an odd fancy,
and it is this. I want you to promise
me, after I have left this beautiful
place and you, that you will
write a description of this drive, as if
to an unknown third person, with the
details and necessary explanations.
I will do the same. Then, if we
meet again, you can read mine and
I yours, if we like, and look back to
this time. Will you promise?"</p>

<p>I considered a minute, and then
said, "I think I can see that such
a description will not be an easy
thing to me; yet, if it is your wish, of
course, Mr. Grey, I promise."</p>

<p>"We may meet after many years,
you an old lady and I an old
man; and these accounts will bring
back to us this perfect day, and all
that we have seen and felt."</p>

<p>I looked at him and smiled. "Mr.
Grey, I have been invited to spend
a year abroad with some friends,
and my father says I may go if I
choose. We may meet next winter,
in Rome."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And in Rome we did meet, sure
enough&mdash;that Rome to which "all
roads lead." I began to take one
of those roads soon after Mr. Grey's
departure. I found it a road "so
plain that a fool could not err therein,"
a "path of peace." And when
we stood side by side in the Rome
of the Seven Hills, he made up his
mind to share the seventh sacrament
with a "convert girl."</p>

<h2>THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE.</h2>

<p class="center">TRANSLATED FROM THE "CARITA."</p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>So great and painful are the sufferings
and terror now weighing upon
the nations of Europe that, setting
every other subject aside, it is toward
that the mind necessarily turns, and
we will accordingly lay before our
readers the deeply rooted convictions
we entertain, not merely in reference
to the year gone by, but to that on
which we are just entering. These
convictions take within their scope
the present most deplorable and
shameful condition of Europe, and a
future that cannot be very far distant.
But which of these subjects shall we
undertake to discuss? Or, were we
to satisfy the necessity there seems
for the treatment of both, should we
be thereby exceeding the limit of our
obligation as journalists? Nothing
is easier, nothing more agreeable in
our case, than to satisfy both the one
and the other. For, if we place before
our readers our reflections on
the present and future of the Christian
nations of Europe, we shall be
at the same time defining and specifying
the principal field of our studies.</p>

<p>I will then examine into the reasons
of the present condition of the
church and of civilization, and I will
do so with a mind as free as may be
from prejudice and the heat of passion.
After judging of events by the
great laws of history, I will endeavor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
to trace out the path which ideas
and facts must follow at no distant
period. My words will indeed be
addressed in an especial manner to
the true children of the church, but
I do not doubt that they will indirectly
reach some who are removed
and even separated from us. Neither
do I deny that I am animated by
the hope of helping to sustain the
courage of my brethren, so that each
one may be able to say to himself,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Modicæ fidei quare dubitasti</i>.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Towards the close of the year
1869, and the commencement of the
year that followed, two solemn utterances
resounded through Europe and
agitated the nations of the universe.
The first of these proceeded from the
Roman Pontiff, the convener of the
Œcumenical Council; the other was
the cry of modern civilization, proclaiming
its own power and its ideas
of universal progress. Both utterances
were of solemn import, but the
one was in contradiction to the other.
The first, or that of the Pontiff, with
all the weight of his divine authority,
laid open to view the true principles
of the other, and strove to reclaim it
to Christ with the new and more
effulgent light of truth and the more
ardent fire of charity. Such words
ought indeed to have found an echo
and penetrated through every fibre
of the universe, for they were in substance
the language of love; from
love they came, and to love they
tended. Had they thus been accepted
by the nations, we should not
have had now so many sufferings to
undergo, nor been menaced by a future
still more calamitous. The other
utterance, that of modern civilization,
inspired by the idea that it was
an invincible and independent power,
spurned the thought not merely of
supernatural aid, but even of supernatural
authority. Moreover, in proof
of its power, it collected then under
distinct heads all the evidences of
the progress of the present age, proffering
them as an infallible guarantee
of new and still greater progress in
the immediate future. Thousands
listened with credulity to such language,
and, opening their hearts to
glorious dreams of the future, exulted
over the hopes they had conceived
with a joy whose folly was unquestionable,
though it would be hard to
pronounce whether it proceeded most
from impiety or pride. It is, however,
a satisfaction to speak with boldness
and candor, calling things by
their right names: such joy was foolish,
because it was at once both
proud and impious. The words of
the Supreme Pontiff were derided, and
abuse and calumnies of every description
were heaped with a lavish
hand on the acts of the Œcumenical
Council.</p>

<p>Now, assuming the active opposition
of these two powers, what consequences
must result from it in the
domain of facts? The problem is
unquestionably an important one, and
we must treat it by first going back
and tracing it downward from first
principles.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The decree of the Pope when summoning
an Œcumenical Council
may be defined as the supreme exercise
of his authority; and the council
so assembled is the greatest and
most universal act of the power of
good with which the church has been
invested; she who is the City of God,
yet a pilgrim upon earth. Reasoning
on these same questions, a year
ago, I recollect having thus expressed
myself: "Assuming that the life
of the Catholic Church is <em>charity</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
both in its source and its organization,
and that the Papacy is the central
seat of charity; what, then, is the
Œcumenical Council, that supreme
act of the Papacy and the church?
The answer is not difficult: it is the
supreme act of charity peculiar to
Catholicity, and is therefore that power
of supernatural love which is alone
strong enough to combat with and
put to flight the gigantic and many-sided
egotism of the times we live
in."</p>

<p>Now, such an act of this all-powerful
charity did the church initiate
on the 8th day of December, 1869&mdash;a
day that will live for ever in the
memory of posterity, and never fail
to be spoken of with blessings. To
the eyes of Catholics, the Council
of the Vatican appeared&mdash;and such
it is&mdash;a new and living fountain of
hope. It seemed as if the yearnings
of three centuries and many generations
were at last to be gratified by
this council. It seemed, in a special
manner, as if the tendencies and
wants of the nineteenth century converged
toward this council, like rays
to a common centre. And here, the
better to understand the truth of
these sentiments, we trust it will not
be unacceptable to our readers if we
lay before them what we ourselves&mdash;partakers
in and witnesses of the universal
conscience&mdash;published on the
very day on which the Œcumenical
Council opened in the Vatican:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"And, in truth, what is the council in
relation to the nineteenth century? It is
the desire of all, a something longed and
sighed for by all minds and all hearts,
the ideal of the noblest and most generous
aspirations that now assert their
sway over the spirit of man. Nor is it
that only, but it is likewise what was
needed to meet the most urgent and widespread
want of our age. It will doubtless
appear strange to very many that the
council should be styled the desire of
all men, but such is nevertheless the
fact; consciously or unconsciously, all
longed for it: all, those who hail it and
those who curse it, those who believe in
it and those who despise it. Yes, all; he
who exalts our age, and he who bewails
its errors, he whose heart is rejoiced, and
he who sheds tears over the events of
our century; princes and people, the
priesthood and the laity, religion and
civilization, faith and science. Assuredly,
were any additional proof necessary
to demonstrate to conviction, by the evidence
of reason and history, that the Papacy
is the heart of humanity, the heart
in which all the aspirations of humanity
converge and unite, here would be the
proof in the summons that convened this
Œcumenical Council. For, from the various
and opposite judgments passed
upon our age, some in adulation, others
in blame, one thing is evident, and all
agree in admitting it, that the tendencies
of our age are directed by a twofold attraction
toward union and liberty. These
guiding influences are in themselves
most powerful, noble, and exalted, because
they mirror the infinite, absolute,
and supreme unity of God. Liberty is
the image and proof of the Infinite Being,
for he alone is truly free, and the
spirit which tends by love toward him is
adorned with liberty, and possesses the
power of reducing its free will to act.
Union is the shadow and effect of the
divine union, because the one God, one
Truth, one Good, one Beauty, can alone
sweetly and strongly bring into accord
the wills and understandings of men,
and cause them to harmonize in the limitless
range of space, and the vicissitude
and diversity of time."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, two such qualities and tendencies
of humanity, acting in an especial
manner, or, in other words,
more powerfully and universally than
ever before, rule over and exalt our
age. He who should say that these
two tendencies, naturally common to
all men, all times, and all places, had
become the passions of the age, and
even its most ardent passions, would
express our ideas on this subject, and
give an adequate description of the
times in which we live.</p>

<p>Liberty, then, and union, are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
cry from every quarter, the thought,
desire, hope, strength, and occupation
of all intellects, of all classes, of
everything that belongs to man, from
the highest to the lowest. Trades,
business, and commerce cry aloud
for liberty, and for union with liberty.
The free co-operation of the industrial
arts and workmen's societies, of
societies of merchants and banking-houses,
are ideas and facts so common
in these days that the dominion
of the two tendencies referred to
above is clearly made manifest in the
lower order of civilization. And this
order, quickened by such ideas and
making use of such aids, becomes the
instrument of new liberty and still
greater union. Thus, the power of
steam triumphing over the obstacles
of matter, and the speed of electricity
overcoming the resistance of space
and time, favor the free expansion of
nation toward nation, and make, I
might almost say, one single society
out of the most distant nations.</p>

<p>Rising from this lower order of
civilization, the industries of every
kind, to what is far nobler, that of
science, we observe the same aspirations,
perhaps more universally diffused
and more passionate in degree
toward liberty and union. Freedom
of thought, freedom of education,
freedom of speech and of the press,
seem to be the idols of the day; for,
strange to say, freedom of the intellectual
life is deemed by very many
not as the dowry of science, but the
fundamental principle of all human
instruction. There exists, also, with
this desire for intellectual freedom, a
craving after union. Scientific congresses,
either general or confined to
some particular branch of knowledge,
succeed each other at no distant intervals,
sometimes in one place and
sometimes in another, so as to unite
men of intellect whom distance of
space had kept asunder. The literary
journals, whose number is so
great as to excite amazement, have
become the arena for the free diffusion
of thought; they keep alive the
work of the scientific congresses, and
spread its knowledge&mdash;spreading it
in such a manner as to complete the
intellectual union of the human race,
by making the speculations of the
great men of science familiar to the
most ordinary intellects.</p>

<p>Turning our gaze from the industrial
and intellectual to the moral
life, that is to say, to the life of society,
the two aspirations appear stronger
and more manifest; so strong and
manifest that we might be tempted
to call them insane and mischievous.
To the cry of liberty, the civilized
nations of earth respond with transport,
and rise in rebellion against
whatever can be shown to be in any
way opposed to freedom. Never in
previous times were such social
changes witnessed, so unexpected, so
general, so profound, and carried
through with so much enthusiasm, as
those just enacted and initiated with
the cry of liberty. The political
organization of nations, the administrative
control of provinces and municipalities,
have all been regulated
by the principle of free election,
freedom of vote and opinion. The
slavery of man to man, a lamentable
relic of paganism, has been abolished
in many places by legal enactment,
and is universally looked on with
more repugnance than heretofore.
After the hard-fought battles in North
America on the question of slavery,
the negroes there have been raised
to the dignity of freemen.</p>

<p>No less vigorous and resistless has
been the tendency toward social
union. The principle of nationality
has traversed all Europe with the rapidity
of lightning, kindling as it passed
the minds of men, exciting and
agitating them in a wonderful manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
Even as we write, the cry for
unions still more comprehensive&mdash;the
union of races&mdash;strikes upon our ears.</p>

<p>It is, then, an indisputable fact, a
fact whose evidence is clear to all
and is admitted by all, that the aspirations
of our age are towards
union and liberty.</p>

<p>We shall therefore hail the council
as the final goal of these aspirations
of the human race. And yet, in saying
this, we have not stated all that
the council implies; for it serves
also to satisfy an essentially human
want that equals those twofold aspirations,
or, to speak more correctly, is
still stronger and more universal than
they. What, then? Shall it be said
that the aspirations and wants of the
human mind are not directed to the
same object? Most assuredly; the
end, but not the immediate object, is
the same. They proceed from different
impulses: the one arises from the
tendencies of the age, but without
any regard to the good or evil qualities
inherent in such tendencies; the
other is the result of a vice that modifies
and corrupts such tendencies, a
vice that may prove fatal to nations,
alluring them by the cry of liberty
and union to slavery and desolation.
The want we refer to argues a vice
to be corrected, an infirmity to be
healed, a danger to be shunned, express
it as we will; but let us not
deny the fact, a most sad and painful
one, for which the council furnishes
a sovereign and most efficacious
remedy.</p>

<p>But what, it will be asked, is this
vice which degrades the noble aspirations
for liberty and union, and
causes such misery to nations? It
is the rejection of authority&mdash;a rejection
absolute and unlimited, that has
penetrated into every relation of
human life. The better, however, to
make our sentiments clear on this
subject, and to bring under consideration,
not the existence of such a
vice, but the cause that produced it,
we must trace the question back to
its source.</p>

<p>The fundamental dogma of the
Protestant Reformation gave birth at
the same instant to a double negation&mdash;the
rejection of liberty and of
union&mdash;so that the servitude of the
human will and individualism were
exalted to the dignity of a principle.
It seems like a contradiction that the
basis of Protestantism, namely, private
interpretation, which is the rejection
of a supreme authority, should
have led in its consequences to servitude.
But the contradiction disappears
when we reflect that so necessary
is authority to man that he
will bow to fatalism or force if he has
no legitimate authority to which to
turn. History bears evidence that
two centuries and a half of debasing
servitude and cruel separations followed.
Such a long period of slumber
must necessarily have had an
awakening; for the innate tendencies
of humanity may for a time grow
faint or dormant, but they can never
be extinguished. Moreover, should
they, for any length of time, be
checked in their natural expansion,
this necessity grows to gigantic proportions,
till it sweeps before it every
obstacle like a torrent in its impetuous
course. Such was the result to
be expected, and which really took
place, at the close of the eighteenth
century. But the minds of men
having been seduced by the sophistries
of the Reformation, the new era
of liberty and union must of necessity
reflect its deceitful philosophy. Therefore,
liberty and union, when they
arose, cast aside the principle of authority,
as Protestantism had done at
its first appearance. Liberty rejected
religion to become atheistical, and
fraternity or union affiliated itself to
pantheism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>And, in truth, atheism and pantheism&mdash;two
systems that harmonize because
they are convertible&mdash;have penetrated
into and made conquests in
every condition of life. Fourierism
and the abuse of industrial unions,
while rejecting authority, have touched
materialism on the one side and
communism on the other, and are
the atheistic and pantheistic forms of
labor. Freedom of speculation, by
spurning at every authoritative principle,
has ended in rationalism; the systematizing
of science has fallen into
pantheism or syncretism; rationalism
and syncretism are the atheistic
and pantheistic forms of the intellectual
life. The modern code of
morality and justice, by stripping liberty
and the brotherhood of mankind
of legitimate authority, have ended
in naturalism and socialism, the atheistic
and pantheistic forms of society.</p>

<p>Now, these two vices, atheism and
pantheism, the leading errors of the
day, have changed the universal
movement toward liberty and union
into matter for the deepest and keenest
sorrow. In the midst of the immense
riches that our age has been
accumulating through its free and associated
industries, there seems to be
nothing that man touches that can
cheer or console him in the solitude
of his heart, and, free lord as he is of
matter, yet he feels himself its slave,
because he has made it the grave of
his noblest aspirations. It might almost
be said that matter, subjugated
in so many ways by the liberty and
union existing among men in these
days, was secretly tyrannizing over
and dividing them, denying man's
authority over it because man has
himself cast off the true and supreme
authority raised over him. In the
same manner, in the life of thought
all our knowledge is felt to be, as
was said of old, but vanity, and a
vanity that crushes and keeps us
asunder from one another. Many,
yes, very many, agree in crying loudly
for liberty and the union of intellect,
but theirs are merely outward
words&mdash;words which do not respond
to the real life of man's intellectual
powers. We shall proclaim openly that
it is a falsehood, and a falsehood by
which man strives to deceive himself,
and, if possible, conceal his sorrow.
Without fear of error, we can say
that modern science tyrannizes in
secret over the intellects of men, and
divides them, because liberty and
the union of intellects rejected or
rather usurped the supreme control
over the minds of men. Rationalists
and pantheists cannot deny this; we
appeal to the truthful testimony of
their own consciences and of history;
we appeal to the candid avowal
of Frederick Schelling. Is it not
true that, beneath the pompous appearances
of liberty and union, the
inner powers of thought are under
the grievous yoke of so-called systems,
and, in addition, are slaved
and tormented by secret and constant
doubts? Is it not true that
great differences exist among men of
intellect, who reject to-day what was
believed yesterday, and that there is
no agreement whatever in the greatest
and most important principles?
To sum up: the intellectual life of
the nineteenth century has neither interior
liberty nor union, because with
Protestantism it has denied the principle
which could alone give freedom
and unity to the minds of men, and
this denial is the only instance of that
liberty and union of which it makes
so great a boast.</p>

<p>Neither in regard to the moral and
social life of nations is the case in
any way different. From the atheistical
liberty of an independent morality
has resulted the interior servitude
of the will, which means the truly
despotic empire of passions most degrading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
to the mass and the individual
and the despotic atheism of
states. And from the pantheistic
union exhibited in the practice of
centralization and the theory of socialism,
there resulted a sanguinary
war in the heart of Christendom: a
war of the state with the church, of
the people with monarchy, a war of
everything in subjection against
everything in authority. Hence we
see in the most civilized countries
the despair of its noblest citizens,
men like the younger Brutus and Cato;
hence the despondency of the
higher station, blended with scorn
and indignation; hence the frantic
aims of the populace breaking forth
into rebellion; hence the enormous
standing armies; hence amidst the
shouts for liberty and fraternity the
nations are arming, and every citizen
is enrolled a soldier.</p>

<p>If such, then, is the condition of
the age and the ferment in the minds
of men, if such is the condition of
the populations, what, let us ask, is
at present the great, the urgent want
of mankind? To contradict the sentiment
of union and liberty would be
madness; to contradict the atheism
of liberty and the pantheism of union
is wisdom and true charity, and
therein safety is to be found; for,
take away pantheism from union, and
atheism from liberty, there will remain
union and true liberty both
exteriorly and interiorly. And assuming
that the deadly principles of
atheism and pantheism sprang from
Protestantism, which rejected the Papacy,
the supreme personification of
power, the return to authority, the
true and only source of liberty and
union, is the great and universal
want of the present age.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>To satisfy so great a want, the
City of God, exercising the most perfect
act of its power of goodness and
love, convoked the Council of the Vatican.
But in opposition to the City of
God in its exercise of this supreme act
of love and goodness, stands the City
of Satan, which has always combated
it, and will continue to do so to
the end of time. It was, therefore,
an easy matter to predict that the
City of Satan would assuredly put
forth its utmost powers of evil in
opposition to that supreme effort of
the church of Christ. Such a conclusion
would be warranted both by
reason and history. By reason, inasmuch
as humanity may well be
likened to a battle-field, wherein the
powers of good and evil contend for
mastery, falsehood, and truth, the
old Adam and the new, Cain and
Abel, Satan and Christ, so that a state
of warfare may be said to be the law
of this life; and as no real progress
can be made but as the result of a
hard-won victory, it follows logically
that our own age, being subject
to the same law, must pass through
a terrible conflict. History bears
evidence to the same effect, how at
critical times the whole powers of
evil rose up in terrible conflict against
the great undertakings of the church.
And I will add that as the work of the
Vatican Council was to bring to light
in a special manner the naturalism of
modern civilization, which deduces
its origin from atheism and pantheism,
and afterwards to strengthen
and exhibit in a clearer light the supreme
authority of the Pope, so,
on the other hand, modern civilization
had to put forth all the strength
it derived from naturalism to crush
the Papacy.</p>

<p>All this might have been and was
foretold. Two periods are to be
distinguished in the brief existence
of the Vatican Council: they are
those which correspond to the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
sessions which the Pope presided over
in person. The first was directed
specially against those monster errors
from which naturalism springs; the
second, after not a hasty but a long
and comprehensive discussion, decreed
the universal supremacy of the
papal authority, the supremacy of
his teaching, that is, the infallibility of
the Pope, when he speaks (to use
the language of the schools) <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex cathedrâ</i>.
You might have said, then, that
the great task of the council was
ended, and time will perhaps show
that you would not have judged
amiss.</p>

<p>However, the City of Satan was
meanwhile no idle spectator, but exerted
its powers in many and various
ways, yet so that it may be said with
truth that two of these corresponded
singularly to the two important periods
of the council. In the first
place, there was witnessed a great
and portentous gathering of free-thinkers
from all countries of the
earth, and to this was assigned the
title of <i>Anticouncil</i>, to signify in the
most open way possible the war
which the naturalism of the day is
waging against the church and the
Papacy. But this gathering failed
to accomplish anything, so that, as
was justly said, the infant cries of
the new-born <i>Anticouncil</i> were also the
last gasp of its mortal agony. In
vain, besides, were all the efforts of
the irreligious press, its sarcasms and
calumnies; in vain the intrigues of
anti-christian diplomacy. In vain,
too, was that last effort, those appeals
of discord flung into the camp
of the assembled bishops. Nor do I
say all when I affirm that such guilty
efforts accomplished nothing against
the council. I might have added, and
I do so without hesitation, that they
shed additional lustre on it. For, if
they prove nothing else, they prove
at least these two truths: first, that
all the efforts of the world and hell
shall not prevail against the church;
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et portæ inferi non prevalebunt adversus
eam</i>; secondly, that the freedom
and fulness of discussion that took
place in the council before defining
dogmatically was greater than its
adversaries expected or even desired.
A new proof, were any such needed,
that the church of Christ is neither
an opponent nor a weakener of the
powers of human reason, but is the
harmonizer of the human element
with the divine, of science with faith,
of liberty with supernatural authority.</p>

<p>This was the first great effort of
the adversaries of the council, but
there soon followed a second. Peaceful
opposition having failed, it was
easy to foresee that modern civilization
would change its mode of warfare,
and instead of moral force would
call to its aid physical force and violence.
But for this it was necessary
that some opportunity be given, and
the invasion of Rome by ruffian
bands as contemplated was too hazardous
an undertaking, so long as
the French eagle cast the shadow of
its protection over the Vatican. The
opportunity wanted was not long in
presenting itself. Strange coincidence!
At the very time when papal infallibility
was added to the dogmas of
faith, and almost on the very day,
war broke out unexpected between
France and Prussia. How Satan
must have exulted with ferocious joy
at that terrible hour! Such a war
seemed to supply his city with the
means of renewing its assaults on
the City of God.</p>

<p>The Prussian minister Bismarck, the
chief representative of modern civilization,
had been for a long time in closest
alliance with the double atheism
of authority and modern liberty, that
is to say, with the autocracy of Russia
and modern revolution, which both
desired the triumph of the German
arms. In consequence of this alliance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
France came single-handed
into the contest, while Prussia drew
with her all Germany. The Northern
armies won astonishing victories,
and their allies shared in the advantages
of them. Preponderance in the
East was again made practicable to the
atheism of authority, and the atheism
of liberty took possession of Rome&mdash;Rome
from whose walls, through a
blunder or a crime, the French government
had withdrawn its troops.
As a consequence, the Pope was
stripped of his temporal power, and
the council suspended.</p>

<p>This was the result of the war
against the Papacy; this was the
crowning effort of the City of Satan
against the City of God&mdash;an effort in
relation to which modern civilization
showed more clearly than before
both its character and the end at
which it aimed. All the organs of
the press that have sold themselves
to the false spirit of the age&mdash;and their
number is very great&mdash;all with unanimity
of sentiment and in one chorus
extolled the shameful outrage to the
skies, and made it the subject of a
senseless triumph. And what deserves
notice, in as far as it goes to
show the truth of our opinions, is
that all pronounced this exploit as
the greatest victory of modern civilization
against Catholic superstition
and the theocracy of the middle ages.</p>

<p>Was it a real victory? And will
it be lasting? Will it be in our power,
reverentially and with due timidity,
to withdraw a little the veil that
covers the designs of Providence in
reference to these facts, and predict
the future? The answer to these
questions cannot be briefly given,
and must therefore form the subject
of a future article. Nevertheless, to
close this article and prepare the
minds of our readers for what is to
follow, I think it necessary to draw a
conclusion from the matters discussed,
and it is this: that our brethren
in the faith have no reason in the
world to be astonished at the painful
events happening in these times.
Such things were necessary&mdash;so necessary
were they that we ourselves, a
year ago, ventured to predict this
contest, when the political atmosphere
was still unclouded, and all
around breathed an air of peace.
"This new year," said we on the first
day of January, 1870, "will be doubtless
one of the most memorable of all
recorded in history. In it, not two
ages, but two great eras meet
and trace broadly their distinction
one from the other&mdash;an era that is
closing, and one that is about to begin.
And in this same year, a momentous
struggle will correspond to the
meeting of the two eras&mdash;the struggle
of two contrary principles which aim
at the conquest of the human race.
The two eras are, that of Protestantism
religious and civil, and that of Christian
revival in all the orders and
relations of the Catholic Church.
The two principles are egotism and
charity&mdash;egotism, which begot and
animates Protestantism, and charity,
which is the life of Catholicity." The
conflict, fierce, terrible, and waged
under different forms, was a necessity;
why, then, be astonished that what
was to take place has really happened?
Is not the spouse of <i>him who
espoused her with his sacred blood</i>
sent forth to combat? Had this
conflict not taken place, we should
have been tempted to say that it
would be necessary to call in question
the great law of human history&mdash;<i>progress
through suffering</i>.</p>

<p>Away, then, with astonishment,
which would be folly! Away with
vain fears! The church has combated
and overcome all the moral force
brought to bear against the Papacy
and the council, and shall it tremble
before brute force? Is not the first
victory a most certain pledge of the
second?</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF YORKE.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER VII.<br />

DRAMATIS PERSONÆ.</h3>

<p>One Saturday evening in June, the
Seaton mail-coach, with two passengers,
drove out of the city of Bragon
on its way eastward. Both these
passengers were gentlemen, and both
young. One was large and light-complexioned;
the other, slight and
dark. The large one had a hard,
white face, whose only expression
seemed to be a fixed determination
to express nothing. Such a look is
provoking. Let us read a little of the
man in spite of himself. People
have no right to shut themselves up
in that way. One would say immediately
that he is what is called a
very good man, one of those good
men whom we praise, and avoid:
that is, he does not offend against
the decalogue nor the revised statutes.
But there is a law radiant with a
tenderer glory, dropped, verse by
verse, through the Scriptures, taught
constantly by the church, attested to
human hearts by the very need of it,
and that law he keeps not. One
wonders at such a man, and, in
softer moods, fancies pitifully that he
aches under that icy coating, and
that down in the depths of his heart
some little unfrozen spring perpetually
troubles his repose by its protesting,
half-stifled murmur. One is also
exasperated by him. "In his society,"
as Miss Clara Yorke said afterward,
"one's thoughts and feelings
become all puckered up." He is indeed
a powerful moral astringent.</p>

<p>As if conscious of our observation,
he turns stiffly away, and looks out of
the window at his elbow, entertaining
his mind with a view of the spiders
that hang from the beams of the
covered bridge through which they
are driving. We are not to be baffled,
however, but can pursue our
scrutiny. He has large, heavy white
hands, his broadcloth is of the finest,
and in the breast-pocket of his coat
is a manuscript sermon. He would
like to have us listen to that sermon,
but will not.</p>

<p>The gentleman who sits at this
person's left is as different as could
well be. He has a thin face, a long
nose inclining slightly upward toward
the end, and haggard, bright
eyes. His forehead is high, and all
the hair is brushed straight back
from it, and falls on his neck. He
has a small mouth, with lips so vividly
red that they seem to be painted.
In his breast-pocket is a bottle of
laudanum, which seems to be very
much at home there.</p>

<p>These gentlemen had never met
before they stepped into the coach
together; and it would be safe to
say that they had no ardent desire to
meet again. They were very slow,
indeed, to improve the opportunity
afforded them to form an acquaintance,
and probably would have
maintained a very formal demeanor
toward each other, had not circumstances
forced them into a most undignified
intimacy. There had been
a succession of pouring rains, and
the roads were frightful, heavy with
mud, and full of pitfalls. After the
coach got out of the town and into
the woods, their situation became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
very trying to the passengers. To
say nothing of the pain of bumps
and bruises, their dignity and sense
of propriety were constantly being
outraged by their being thrown into
each other's arms, or having their
heads knocked violently together.
Under such difficulties, silence became
impracticable. Apologies became
necessary, and exclamations irrepressible.
He of the sermon never
said anything worse than "Bless me!"
but the other had occasionally to
stifle an ejaculation which would not
have been so pleasant to hear.</p>

<p>The coach was due at Seaton at
four o'clock in the morning; but as
hours passed, and still their motion
was chiefly lateral and perpendicular,
their prompt arrival receded
from a probability to a possibility,
and thence became impossible. They
had started at nine o'clock; and at
three of the next morning they yet
lacked nearly a mile of reaching the
half-way house where they were to
change horses. At that point one of the
wheels suddenly slipped into a deep
rut. The four steaming horses strained
and tugged till they started the
coach, when it immediately gave a
lee-lurch, and went into a hole at
the other side. At the same moment,
something, whatever it is which
holds horse and carriage together,
snapped, and the quadrupeds started
off on their own account, leaving the
coach and the bipeds to follow at
their leisure. The driver, having
the reins in his hands, was of course
pulled off the box; but the road received
him softly. The passengers
need have suffered no damage, but
that the tall one, having, curiously
enough, the impression that they
were being run away with instead of
from, jumped out of the coach with
more haste than discretion. The
spot he sank into was the rut from
which the front wheel had just been
drawn, and the result was that he
emerged upon the roadside in a deplorable
masquerade, being clad in
a complete domino of well-mixed
clay and water. Moreover, his ankle
was quite severely sprained.</p>

<p>"You'll have to walk to the half-way
house, gentlemen," the driver
said, calmly wiping the mud from
his face. He had been over that
road too many times to be much disturbed
at any mishap of the kind.
Having spoken, he shouldered the
mail-bags, and started in advance.
It was full three minutes before the
other passenger appeared, and, when
he did, his face was perfectly grave,
though very red. He threw a blanket
he had found inside out into the
road, and stepped on to it. He next
reached in and got a cushion, with
which he completed the bridge across
the mud, then walked over them as
unstained as Queen Elizabeth over
Raleigh's mantle, and stepped dry-shod
in the neatest of boots on to
the rim of the delicate moss that
spread its carpet all along the roadside
under the trees. Having landed
safely, he turned toward his companion,
who was trying to wash himself
in a brook and scrape his clothes
with sticks. "I should advise you,
sir," he said, "to come right on to
the house, and get a complete change
of clothing. It is useless to try to
clean those."</p>

<p>The other was speechless, and
seemed too much stupefied to do anything
more than obey.</p>

<p>Morning was just breaking, cloudless
and beautiful, the forest was fresh
with June, and through it could be
heard the elfish laughter of brooks.
While the travellers had through the
night been racked and tormented,
conscious only of misery and mud,
all around them nature had reposed
in her loveliness and purity, with her
birds sweetly nestled, her flowers dewwashed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
her streams crystal-clear.
Their road had been like a foul
thread woven across a beautiful web.</p>

<p>When they reached the half-way
house, the tall traveller was in a perfectly
abject state. His pride had
quite disappeared, his dignity was nowhere
to be seen. He allowed himself
to be arrayed in a suit of rough
farming-clothes a good deal too short,
in which he beheld himself without
a smile, and humbly begged his
fellow-traveller to bear a message
from him to his expecting friends in
Seaton. Not only his toilet, but his
sprained ankle would prevent his
proceeding on his journey for some
hours at least. His name was Conway;
he was a Baptist minister, and
was expected to preach in Seaton
that day. Would the gentleman be
so good as to send word to the
church, as soon as he arrived, that
their looked-for candidate had met
with an accident? He was not personally
acquainted with any one in
Seaton, therefore could not direct
him, but presumed that the driver
could.</p>

<p>The gentleman with the bright
eyes cordially promised, then asked
for breakfast and a clothes-brush, and
the other withdrew to rest.</p>

<p>"There's not time to cook anything
but coffee and fish," the landlord
said. "Passengers never stop
here to breakfast; and the driver is
going on in fifteen minutes. But I'll
do the best I can for you."</p>

<p>In ten minutes all was ready. The
traveller brushed his clothes scrupulously,
combed his hair back in a
silken wave, bathed his face and
hands, gave himself one more look
to be sure that his toilet was correct,
then seated himself at table. The
principal dish before him was an eel
fried in sections, then carefully put
together, and coiled round the plate.</p>

<p>"Not much of a breakfast," the
landlord said. "But we haven't any
market here."</p>

<p>"Sir!" exclaimed the traveller in
a deep voice, "I asked for fish, and
you give me a serpent! I would as
soon&mdash;I would sooner eat of an anaconda
than an eel."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you do not like it, sir,"
the man replied. "If we raised
anacondas here, you should have
one; but we don't."</p>

<p>The traveller drank his coffee, and
found it not bad. "I will try to do
without snakes, this morning," he
remarked.</p>

<p>There were twelve miles yet to
travel; but the road improved slightly
as they went on. Still it was tedious
work; and when at last they
drove into the town, it was past ten
o'clock, and the bells were ringing
for Sunday service.</p>

<p>When the coach reached the post-office,
in the centre of the town, the
traveller jumped out, and asked to be
directed to the Universalist meeting-house.
"And please send word to
the Baptist people of the accident
which befell their minister," he said.
"It will be impossible for me to do
so now."</p>

<p>The driver promised, and directed
the stranger. "Go over the bridge
here, and up the hill, and you will
come to a white meeting-house with
green blinds," he said.</p>

<p>The traveller hastily followed the
direction, and soon came to a house
answering the description given. The
congregation were all in their seats;
and as the new-comer breathlessly
entered, he heard a voice from the
pulpit. "My beloved brethren," the
voice said, "I am sorry to inform
you that the minister who was to
have preached for us to-day will not
probably come. The stage has not
come in, and has, most likely, met
with an accident. But since you
have all gathered together here to-day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
it seemed to me a pity that you
should go away without hearing the
word of life. I have therefore
brought a volume of sermons by the
reverend&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the deacon stopped at sight
of the stranger hurrying up the aisle,
made an awkward gesture, took out
his pocket-handkerchief, and, finally,
descended sheepishly at one side of
the pulpit as our belated traveller
went up the other.</p>

<p>The minister seated himself on the
red velvet sofa, which in the temple
occupied the place of an altar, fumbled
a while in the hymn-book for a
hymn he could not find, wiped his
heated face, finally read at random.
Presently there was heard from the
gallery over the entrance the faint
twang of a tuning-fork, then a man's
voice feeling for the key, which he
had to transpose from A to C. Pouncing
upon it at length in a stentorian
<i>do</i>, he soared gradually up through
dominant to octave, the choir caught
their parts, and the hymn began.
Unfortunately, however, in their haste
they had selected a common metre
tune for a long metre hymn, as they
discovered at the end of the second
line, where they found themselves in
difficulty by reason of two syllables
which were unprovided for by the
music, yet could not well be left out.</p>

<p>While they were extricating themselves,
and finding a more fitful tune,
the minister took breath, and looked
round on his congregation. They
disappointed him. He had been informed
that his hearers were to be
the young, progressive spirits of the
town; and these looked anything but
young and progressive. They were
nearly all old and antiquated, and
their faces struck a chill through
him. They seemed to be the faces
of people who believe that one of
the chief pleasures of heaven consists
in looking over the celestial battlements
and witnessing the torments of
the condemned, rather than of those
who hold the comfortable doctrine
of universal salvation. Stern, fateful,
stolid, they sat there, not even provoked
to a passing smile by the ludicrous
<i>contretemps</i> of the choir. The
minister frowned. He was tired, he
had been irritated by his travelling
companion, and now he was bitterly
disappointed. Seaton was a
growing town that would soon be
a city, and he had looked forward
with pleasure to the prospect of being
settled there. There seemed nowhere
else for him to go, and he was
not rich, and he was homeless. The
sight of this congregation, which he
saw at once he could never reconcile
himself to, disturbed him greatly.
Moreover, in his haste he had forgotten
to take his morning dose of laudanum;
and, altogether, but for a
glimpse he got of two faces near
the pulpit, he might have marched
down, and left the deacon to read as
many sermons as he chose. These
two reconciling faces belonged to Miss
Melicent Yorke and her brother Owen,
who were visiting the different Seaton
churches. The fair, tranquil face of
the lady, her delicate dress, her folded
hands, even the wreath of violets
that rested on her flaxen hair, all
made a pleasant picture for the cultivated
glance that swept over it. Of
Owen he saw only the top of the
head, and the hand that covered his
face. But his attitude showed that
he was hiding a laugh; and anybody
who could laugh in that congregation
was balm to the minister's
eyes. In those two he felt sure of
sympathy.</p>

<p>The hymn over, the minister read
a psalm and repeated the Lord's
Prayer.</p>

<p>The congregation listened with
lengthening faces. In fact, the disapprobation
was mutual. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
place, they were shocked that the
candidate for their pulpit should
travel on the Lord's day; in the next
place, his looks and manners were
too little like those of their former pastor,
the Rev. Jabez True; thirdly,
they had never before had the Our
Father foisted on them for a prayer.
They were accustomed to hear a long
and explicit address to the Deity, in
which their wishes and thoughts were
explained to him, and their praises
and thanks duly meted out&mdash;a
prayer which they could talk about
afterward. Elder True had been
gifted in prayer, and would sometimes
pray half an hour without a
moment's hesitation. It was certainly
a very shabby thing to put them
off with the Lord's Prayer.</p>

<p>Then came the sermon. Only two
persons present knew that the text
was from the Koran. It was a story
of a certain good man who had a
plantation of palm-trees, to which he
used to call the poor, and give them
such fruit as the knife missed or the
wind blew off. He died; and his
sons felt too poor to give anything
away. So they agreed to come early
in the morning, and gather the
fruit when the poor could not know.
But in laying their plans, they omitted
to add, "If it please God!" In the
night a storm passed over the garden,
and in the morning it was as
one where the fruit had all been gathered.</p>

<p>There are various ways in which
such a text could be treated. Our
speaker, changing his plan at the last
minute, irritated by the cold and unsympathizing
faces about him, and
by his personal discomforts, chose to
enforce this thought: there are those
who fancy that all the fruits of grace
are theirs, that they are the elect,
and that those outside of their walls
shall perish with hunger while they
are feasting. Behold, the whirlwind
of the wrath of God shall sweep away
the good they only seem to have,
and leave them poorer than Lazarus.
It was a forced interpretation; but
the speaker was dextrous, and made
himself appear consecutive even
when he rambled most. With passionate
vehemence, he denounced those
sanctimonious souls who mistake a
curvature of the spine for humility, and
a nasal twang for an evidence of
grace. "I love not," he said, "those
cold and heavy souls that never take
a generous fire. One wonders if they
ever will burn&mdash;under any future circumstances.
They flatter themselves
that they are good and just and reasonable
because they are emotionless.
It is not so. No heart is pure that
is not passionate; no virtue safe that
is not enthusiastic. Is the diamond
less fine because it is brilliant? Has
the sea no depth because it sparkles
on the surface? Would the cannon-ball
go further flung by the hand
than it does when shot from the cannon's
mouth? Is truth always a
mountain crowned with snow? It
may be a volcano. A strong and
sweet thinker has said, 'The wildest
excess of passion does not injure
the soul so much as respectable selfishness
does;' and he says rightly.
I protest against the apotheosis of
phlegm. There are many phases
of good, and each has his way; but,
for my part, I prefer the faults of
heat to the faults of cold. The former
are often generous faults, the latter
never so. The faults of the former
are on the surface, and can neither
be denied nor hidden; those of the
latter are deep-rooted, and may be and
often are mistaken for virtues. Who
were the great saints? Look at the
reckless Magdalen, the vehement St.
Paul, the hasty St. Peter. St. John
of the Cross quotes as an axiom in
theology the saying that God moves
all things in harmony with their constitution;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
and the history of the
world shows that, when he wanted to
kindle a grand and holy conflagration,
he took for workers combustible men
and women. Among the apostles,
the only one who was cold and calculating
enough to count money
and think of the purse when the
Lord was near enough to set all their
hearts on fire was Judas, and not
the worst Judas in the world either.
For since his time many a pretended
follower has weighed the Holy One
in a balance, and sold him for a
price, and has lacked the after-grace
to hang himself."</p>

<p>"Let us pray!"</p>

<p>It was only when Miss Yorke and
her brother rose, that the astonished
and scandalized congregation understood
that the sermon was really
over, and they were to stand up and
listen to a prayer.</p>

<p>The minister spoke in a voice yet
vibrating with excitement: "O Lord
God of morning and evening, of
storm and sunshine, of the dew that
bathes the violet and the frost that
cracks the rock&mdash;God of the east
and the west, and all that lies between
them&mdash;God of our souls and
our bodies, of bliss and of anguish&mdash;O
God, who alone rewardest failure,
who for thy mantle, which eludes our
grasp, givest us thy hand to clasp&mdash;may
all thy creatures adore thee!
Our praise goes up like the note of
the small bird in the branches; but
thou hast made us weak. All power
is thine! Our hearts swell and
break at thy feet as the waves break
upon the shore; but thou hast set
our limit. Space is in the hollow of
thy hand! We lift our eyes toward
thee, and their gaze is baffled; but
thou, who seest all things, hast
sealed their vision. Glory and
honor and power be unto thee, inscrutable
Wisdom, for ever and ever.
Amen!"</p>

<p>"And he calls that a prayer!"
thought the congregation.</p>

<p>"Why, it is like a Catholic prayer!"
whispered Melicent to her brother.
"And he quotes St. John of the
Cross, and the Koran, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecce Homo</i>.
He must be an eclectic minister."</p>

<p>The congregation went out with
very glum faces, and scattered to
their various homes. Only the deacon
waited in the porch, as in duty bound,
to invite the minister home to dinner.</p>

<p>"I suppose you will go home with
me, Brother Conway," he said, freezingly.</p>

<p>"Conway!" echoed the minister.
"You mistake, sir! My name is
Griffeth."</p>

<p>The deacon stared. "We were
expecting the Reverend John Conway
to preach to-day, as a candidate
for our pulpit," he said, eyeing Mr.
Griffeth suspiciously. "Do you come
in his place?"</p>

<p>An expression of perplexity, instantly
succeeded by one of poignant
amusement, passed over the
minister's face. Then he became
grave. "It seems that I have come
in his place," he said, "but most unwillingly.
Brother Conway met with
an accident which delayed him. He
sent his regrets to you by me, and
hopes he may be here this afternoon.
Good-morning, sir! I will not burden
your hospitality to-day."</p>

<p>The deacon's face cleared. It
was a blessed relief to find that they
would have no more to do with this
man.</p>

<p>The stranger crossed the portico
to where Melicent and Carl still lingered,
having overheard this conversation.
"I beg your pardon!" he
said. "But will you have the kindness
to tell me of what denomination
the church is in which I have been
preaching?"</p>

<p>"It is Baptist," Carl replied; "of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
the kind, I think, they call 'Hard-shelled.'"</p>

<p>"God be praised!" ejaculated the
minister. "I have got into the
wrong pulpit!"</p>

<p>Melicent immediately insisted on
his going home with them. "We
can at least protect you from the
Hard-shells until your own friends find
you," she said.</p>

<p>The invitation being cordially given,
and seconded by Carl, the minister
thankfully accepted it, and they
started on their homeward way.
"My blunder is likely to give great
offence to one-half the town, and
great amusement to the other half,"
he said, as they went along. "I am
truly thankful to find a refuge from
both."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke received her unexpected
guest with the greatest kindness;
Mr. Yorke, with the greatest courtesy.
It was one of the pleasantest
families in the world to visit. Not
easily accessible to everybody, nor
quick to form intimacies, whomever
they did receive, they made at once
at home. There was a charming
ease in their company. Your sole
reminder that they understood the
proprieties of life was the fact that
they never sinned against them.</p>

<p>Seated in the midst of the family,
who gathered about him, the minister
related the adventures of the
last twenty-four hours to his smiling
auditory. Only two persons present
were grave. Edith could perceive
nothing ludicrous in the circumstances.
It was a most sad and uncomfortable
fact that Minister Conway
should have got into the mud,
she thought; and, as to preaching
in the wrong pulpit, that seemed to
her a very awful mistake. The other
solemn face belonged to little Eugene
Cleaveland, five years old, Major
Cleaveland's youngest son. The
child was a pet of the Yorkes, and
always stayed with them when his
father was away from home. He
had quite adopted them as his relatives.
Mr. and Mrs. Yorke were
his aunt and uncle. The others were
all cousins. Leaning on Clara's lap,
quite unmindful of her caressing
hand in his hair or on his cheek, he
gazed with large, bright black eyes at
the minister, drinking in every word,
and thinking his own thoughts.</p>

<p>"Isn't your God as good as their
God is?" he asked suddenly in the
the first pause.</p>

<p>"We have all the same God, my
child," the minister replied; and immediately
added to the others, "I
perceive that we had better change
the subject, lest the little ones should
be scandalized. I fancy I even read
reproof in the eyes of your niece,
madam. And, by the way, she looks
like some solemn, medieval religious."</p>

<p>"It is odd she should suggest that
thought to you," Mrs. Yorke said.
"The child is a Catholic. Come,
my dear, and show Mr. Griffeth what
a pretty prayer-book you have. It
was given me by a very lovely and
zealous French lady whom I knew
in Paris. I thought it would do
Edith most good."</p>

<p>Edith approached the minister with
hesitation, half-pleased with him,
half-doubtful. But while he talked
pleasantly to her, glancing over
the book without a sign of prejudice,
explaining and praising here
and there, her doubts were forgotten.
What the child instinctively felt was,
that the man had no religious convictions;
but, her reason being undeveloped,
she could not understand
what he lacked. When he learned
that she was half-Polish, he delighted
her by telling how, in the glorious
days of Poland, when the nobles
heard Mass, they unsheathed their
swords at the Gospel, to show that
they were ready on the instant to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
battle for the faith, and he promised
to procure for her a little handful of
earth from the sacred soil of Praga.
He then repeated and translated for
her an anonymous hymn to the Holy
Innocents, written in the fourth century,
and, at Mrs. Yorke's request,
copied it into the prayer-book. It
was this:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Salvete, flores martyrum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quos lucis ipso in limine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christi insecutor sustulit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceu turbo nascentes rosas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vos, prima Christi victima,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grex immolatorum tener,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aram ante ipsam, simplices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Palma et coronis luditis."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Miss Yorke presently excused herself
with the smiling announcement
that she must prepare the dessert for
dinner, and Clara went out to gather
flowers for the dinner-table, taking
Eugene Cleaveland with her.</p>

<p>They roamed about the edge of
the woods, finding wild-roses and
violets; they ventured into wet places
for the blue flower-de-luce; they
gathered long plumes of ferns, and
in a dusky cloister where a brook
had hidden one of its windings, they
found a cardinal-flower lighting the
place like a lamp.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little boy cried out,
and began to dance about. There
was a bug gone away up in his
jacket, he declared.</p>

<p>Clara searched him, but found nothing.</p>

<p>"There's nothing on you, little
dear!" she said. "Come home, now.
It is dinner-time, and you must help
me to arrange the flowers. There is
no bug, child; it is all your imagination."</p>

<p>"Does my imagination wiggle?"
he cried indignantly. "There!"</p>

<p>The last exclamation referred to
a creeping at his throat; and out
hopped an active little frog, which
had been circumnavigating the child
ever since he pulled the last blue lily.</p>

<p>They went homeward with their
baskets of flowers, and encountered
on the way Boadicea Patten with her
baby in her arms. She had come to
see her son and daughter, and was
trying to keep out of sight of the
front windows, where she saw a
stranger.</p>

<p>Clara Yorke immediately seized
upon the infant. No baby ever
escaped her caresses; and this one
the young ladies had taken under
their especial charge. They supplied
its wardrobe, and went to see
it, or had it come to them every
week. It was a pretty child, bright,
white, and well-mannered, with a
lordly air of taking homage as if it
were due.</p>

<p>When Clara entered the parlor, she
found only the gentlemen and Edith
there; but that did not prevent her
insisting on her little one being received
with enthusiasm. She called
attention to the wonderful dimpled
shoulders and elbows, pulled its eyelids
down pitilessly to display the
long lashes, uncurled its yellow locks
and let them creep back into rings
again, and crowned it with violets,
quoting Browning:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Violets instead of laurel in the hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As those were all the little locks could bear."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Then she consigned the child to
her brother. "I have domestic cares
to attend to," she said, "and you
must amuse my beauty while I am
gone. 'What must you do?' Talk
to it, of course. 'What shall you
say?' Why, Owen, do not be stupid!
Say whatever you can think of that
is suited to the darling's capacity.
Come, Eugene, we have important
affairs on hand."</p>

<p>Carl looked at his charge with immense
good-will and not a little perplexity,
and it stared back solemnly
at him, waiting to be entertained.
Something must be said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is your opinion concerning
the origin of ideas?" asked the young
man, at length, with great politeness.</p>

<p>Instantly the little face brightened
with delighted intelligence; the lips
became voluble in a strange language,
and the dimpled hands caught
at Carl's sunny locks.</p>

<p>"Oh! for an interpreter," he exclaimed.
"If we had an interpreter,
we could confound the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i>.
Clara," to his sister just returning,
"what is this little wretch saying?"</p>

<p>"He is saying that he loves everybody
in the whole world!" she cried,
catching the babe in her arms, and
half-stifling it with kisses. "And,
now, please come to dinner."</p>

<p>"It is not a bad solution," mused
the minister, as he and Carl went out
last. "Perhaps love is the root from
which our ideas grow. Undoubtedly
the kind of ideas a person has depends
on the nature and degree of
his loving."</p>

<p>"You see that here we stand not
upon the order of our going," Clara
laughed back from the doorway;
"or, rather, we follow the style of
ecclesiastical processions, and place
the principal person last."</p>

<p>There was a cluster of yellow
violets by Mr. Griffeth's plate. His
eyes often turned on them, and
always with a grave expression.
"They remind me of a brother I have
lost," he said at length to Mrs. Yorke.
"Philip used to paint flowers beautifully,
and a bunch of yellow violets
was the last thing he painted. If
you were not new-comers in Seaton,
I should think it possible that you
might have seen or heard of him.
He went to school here to an old
minister, Mr. Blake, the predecessor,
I believe, of Dr. Martin."</p>

<p>"Philip Griffeth!" Mrs. Yorke exclaimed,
blushing with surprise,
"Why, I went to school with him. I
recollect him perfectly. This is my
native place, Mr. Griffeth. Yes,
Philip was the favorite of every one,
teacher and pupils. He used to
help me with my Virgil. Mr. Blake
made us all study Latin, and the
boys had to study Greek. The minister
thought that no person should
be admitted into polite society who
did not know one at least of these
languages. I recollect him, a small,
pompous man, with an air of fierceness
very foreign to his character.
He wished to be thought a stern and
fateful personage, while in truth he
was the softest man alive. When he
used to come to our house, and extend
his awful right hand to me, I
always knew that the left hand, hidden
behind his back, held a paper of
candy."</p>

<p>The discovery of this mutual friend
formed a strong tie between the minister
and his new acquaintances, so
that they seemed quite like old
friends. The family pressed him to
stay till evening, when they would
send for some of his people to come
for him; and he, nothing loth, consented.</p>

<p>"But, I warn you," he said to the
young people, when they had returned
to the parlor, "that, unless you allow
me to see you often, this hospitality
will be a cruel kindness. I should
find it harder to lose than never to
have had your society. I could not
console myself with less than the
best, as this pretty rustic did," taking
up an illustrated copy of <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Maud Müller</i>
that lay at his elbow. "But
what a perfect thing it is!" he added.</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke was just passing
through the room on her way to take
an afternoon <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">siesta</i>. She paused by
the table, and glanced at the book.
"It is perfect all but the ending,"
she said; "that is too pre-Raphaelite
for me. Doubtless it would have
happened quite so; but I do not wish
to know that it did."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>"But should not art be true to
nature?" asked Mr. Griffeth. He
liked to hear and see the lady talk.
Her gentle ways and delicate, pathetic
grace, all charmed him.</p>

<p>"Art should be true to nature
when nature is true to herself," she
replied. "I am not a pre-Raphaelite.
I believe that the mission of art
is to restore the lost perfection of nature,
not to copy and perpetuate its
defects. Otherwise it is not elevating;
and what it makes you admire
chiefly is the talent which imitates,
not the genius which sees. I believe
that genius is insight, talent only outsight.
My husband defines genius
as artistic intuition. Why should
the poet have cheated us into loving
a fair, empty shape? If the girl had
been disappointed, and had lived
apart and lonely to the end of her
days, the picture would have been
lovely and pathetic. But now it is
revolting."</p>

<p>"I agree with mamma," Miss
Yorke interposed. "If Maud Müller
had married the judge, she would
never have appreciated him. If she
had been capable of it, she could
not have condescended to the other
after having seen him."</p>

<p>"I should believe," the minister
said, "that, if she had possessed true
nobleness of soul, she could not
have so lowered herself, even if she
had seen nothing better. To my
mind, people rise to their proper level
by spontaneous combustion, needing
no outward spark, women as well as
men. The philosophy of the Comte
de Gabalis may be very true as to
gnomes, sylphs, and salamanders;
but for women I think that such radical
changes never occur. That theory
belongs to those men who, as
Mrs. Browning says, believe that 'a
woman ripens, like a peach, in the
cheeks chiefly.'"</p>

<p>"So we have disposed of poor
Maud Müller," said Mrs. Yorke. "I
repent me of having been so harsh
with the sweet child. Let us say
that the poet wronged her; that in
truth she faded away month by
month, and grew silent, and shadowy,
and saint-like, not knowing what was
the matter with her, but feeling a
great need of God's love; and so
died."</p>

<p>With a sigh through the smile of
her ending, Mrs. Yorke passed noiselessly
from the room. The shadows
of the vine-leaves seemed to strain
forward to catch at her white dress,
and the sunlight dropping through
turned her hair to gold. Then
shadow and sunlight fell to the floor
and kissed her footsteps, missing her.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke was out walking about
his farm, inquiring of Patrick how
many months it took in that country
for plants to get themselves above
ground; if green peas were due early
in September; if cucumbers were
not in danger of freezing before they
arrived at maturity; if their whole
crop, in short, did not promise to
give them their labor for their pains;
and making various other depreciatory
comments which his assistant
inwardly resented. The young people
sat in the parlor and improved
their acquaintance. Soon they found
themselves talking of personal matters
and family plans, especially those
relating to Owen.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffeth strongly urged his
remaining in Seaton. "I think it
would be better to remain if you
should conclude to study law," he
said. "You could pursue your studies
here without the distractions of
a city life, and you could begin practice
with a clearer field. You would
at once be prominent here, but in the
city there would be a crowd of able
and experienced practitioners in your
way."</p>

<p>"'I would rather be second in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
Athens than first in Eubœa,'" Carl
objected.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly!" was the immediate
response. "But you might
save time by trying your wings in
Eubœa before essaying your flight in
Athens."</p>

<p>The sister eagerly seconded the
proposal, delighted with any plan by
which they could keep their brother
with them and yet not injure his
prospects. Carl listened with favor.
His new friend had completely captivated
him; and, sure of such congenial
companionship, Seaton appeared
to him a tolerable place to
live in.</p>

<p>"Of course, I am not quite disinterested,"
Mr. Griffeth said. "I
want you to stay. But, also, it does
seem to me well. The place is promising.
I am told that it has some
superior people, and that it is growing
rapidly. My own coming was a
chance, and already I rejoice in it.
One impulse pushed me toward the
south, another toward the north:
obeying a philosophical law, I came
east, and here I shall stay. I recognized
a Providence in it. May not
you the same?"</p>

<p>"Oh! do stay, Owen," Hester
said, laying her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"What can I do when the evening
star pleads with me?" said Carl with
a smile. When he was pleased with
his youngest sister, he called her
Hesper.</p>

<p>"And you know, Carl, you promised
to teach me to spell, this summer,"
said Clara. "I cannot spell!"
she confessed to the minister.</p>

<p>"Madam, I congratulate you!"
he replied.</p>

<p>"But it is not ignorance," she said,
blushing very much. "English
spelling is nothing but memory, you
know. Now, my memory is situated
in my heart, not my head, and it retains
only what I love or hate. You do
not expect me to be fond of vowels
and consonants, or enamored of poly-syllables,
surely."</p>

<p>The minister protested that he
was always enchanted to meet with
an educated person who could not
spell. It was, he said, the mark of a
mind which catches so ardently at
the soul of a word that it misses
the form. "I have no doubt," he
said, "that you might talk with a
person a hundred times, and comprehend
his character perfectly, yet not
be able to tell the color of his eyes
nor the shape of his nose. You
could also go unerringly to a place
you had once visited, though you
could not direct a person there.
You do not gather your knowledge
like corn in the ear, but in the golden
grain; and when anybody wants
the cob, you have to go searching
about in waste places for it."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke came in, and presently
Mrs. Yorke, with a little sleep-mistiness
hanging yet about her.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, auntie?"
cried Eugene Cleveland, running to
her. He had his hands full of dandelion
curls, which he began hanging
in her ears, having thus adorned the
young ladies.</p>

<p>"I have been to the land where
dreams grow on trees," she said softly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Griffeth says that I am a
little man," the child announced,
with an air of consequence. The remark
had been made an hour before,
and was not yet forgotten. The lad
had indeed an exceedingly good
opinion of himself, and never forgot
a word of praise.</p>

<p>Clara called him to her. "You
are no more a man," she said, "than
potato-balls are potatoes."</p>

<p>He sobered instantly, and went
about for some time with a very forlorn
countenance. After awhile,
when she had forgotten the remark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
he came back to her. "Cousin
Clara, do potato-balls ever grow
into potatoes?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>In the evening the Universalist deputation
arrived, and took their minister
away with them.</p>

<p>"Now, Pat, you mark my words,"
said Betsey, as she saw the family
stand on the moonlight veranda to
watch their visitor down the avenue:
"that man will marry one of the
Yorke girls."</p>

<p>Betsey considered the speedy marriage
of the young ladies a consummation
devoutly to be wished.</p>

<p>Patrick was still smarting under the
insults offered to his garden, and
would not in any case have hailed
the alliance of a minister with the family.
"Oh, bali! they wouldn't look
at him!" he replied crossly. "A
rogue of a minister, with his nose in
the air!"</p>

<p>"I have eyes in my head," said
Betsey with dignity.</p>

<p>"And a bee in your bonnet," retorted
the man.</p>

<p>Betsey went into the house, banged
the door behind her, and began
setting the kitchen to rights with
great vigor. She swept up the hearth
so fiercely that a cloud of ashes came
out and settled on the mantelpiece,
and put the chairs back against the
wall with an emphasis that made
them rattle.</p>

<p>Patrick put his head in at the
door, prudently keeping his body
out, and looked at her with a deprecating
smile. "Now, Betsey!" he
said.</p>

<p>"You needn't speak to me again,
to-night," she exclaimed, looking severely
away from him. "You've said
enough for one time."</p>

<p>"And what have I said to you,
Betsey?"</p>

<p>She faced him. "I wonder if in
your country it is considered a compliment
to tell a woman that she has
a bee in her bonnet," she said.</p>

<p>"Ah! is that where you are?"
said Pat, coming half into the room.
"I never meant the least harm in my
life. And, sure, Betsey, did ye ever
see a bonnet without a <i>b</i>?"</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

FATHER RASLE.</h3>

<p>One summer morning, Mr. Yorke
appeared at the breakfast-table with a
very sour face. He was bilious, and
he had not slept well. Even Hester's
cooing ways failed to mollify
him.</p>

<p>"Why, you are feverish, papa,"
she said. "Your hand is hot and
dry."</p>

<p>He moved his chair impatiently.
"Yes, your mother insisted on my
taking charcoal instead of calomel,
and I think she must have slily administered
a lucifer-match with it: I
radiate heat."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke took these complaints
very quietly. She knew that nothing
could be further from her husband's
heart than to be dissatisfied with anything
she did. "We were disturbed
by that fearful noise," she said quietly,
taking her place at the table.</p>

<p>Owen began to laugh. The Seaton
"cast-iron band" had been out
the night before, and the young man
found himself very much amused by
it.</p>

<p>"Do you like lawlessness, sir?"
demanded Mr. Yorke.</p>

<p>"That depends on what the law
is," the son replied pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, in this case it is the law
of common decency, of respect for
the clergy, and courtesy to strangers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
Father Rasle, the Catholic priest,
came here yesterday, and that Babel
of cow-bells, and sleigh-bells, and
mill-saws, and tin trumpets, and wooden
drums, and I know not what else,
was before his door. I call it a
shameful outrage."</p>

<p>"So do I," Owen replied promptly.
"I had no idea what it meant."</p>

<p>The young ladies all exclaimed indignantly;
but Edith dropped her
eyes and was silent. Theology was
nothing to her, and as yet her faith
had no life in it. She was deeply
ashamed of that religion which all
seemed to scoff at save those who
tolerated it for her sake. Only her
promise held her to it. That the
voice of the people is not always,
is very seldom, the voice of God, she
could not be expected to know; neither
could she be expected to love
that church which as yet she had
heard spoken of only by its enemies.
She did not dream of forsaking the
religion of her mother; but her constancy
to it seemed to her of the
same nature as Mrs. Rowan's constancy
to her drunken husband.</p>

<p>After breakfast, her uncle bade her
dress to go with him to call on Father
Rasle. She obeyed, though with a
shrinking heart. She had heard
priests spoken of in the street and
by the school-children with contempt
and reviling, and her impression was
that they must be very disagreeable
persons to meet. But the religion
was hers, and she must stand by it,
never confessing to a doubt nor allowing
any one to reproach it unchallenged
by her. And if she stood
by the religion, she must stand by the
priest.</p>

<p>Father Rasle, being only a missionary
there, had no house in Seaton,
but stopped with a decent Irish
family. It was a poor place, and
the room in which he received Mr.
Yorke and his niece was as humble
as could well be imagined. But
there needed no fine setting to show
that he was that noblest object on
earth, a Christian gentleman. His
age might have been a little over
forty, and his manner was almost
too grave and dignified, one might
think at first; but it soon appeared
that he could be genial beyond most
men.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke presented his niece, and,
before explaining their errand, apologized
for the insult that had been offered
the priest the night before.</p>

<p>"Oh! I certainly did not expect
the honor of a serenade," said Father
Rasle, laughing pleasantly. "But, if
it gratified them to give it, I am not
in the least offended. It is, perhaps,
a loss to me that I did not care; for
I might have derived some profit
from the mortification. On the contrary,
I own to you, sir, that I enjoyed
that concert. It was the most
laughable one I ever heard."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke looked at the speaker
in astonishment. Here was a kind
of pride, if pride it could be called,
which he could not understand. In
such circumstances, his own impulse
would have been to shoot his insulters
down instantly. What he
despised he wanted to crush, to rid
the earth of, to spare himself the
sight of; what the priest despised
he pitied, he wished to raise, to excuse,
to spare God and the world
the sight of. It was admirable, his
visitor owned, but inimitable by him.</p>

<p>Not being able to say any more on
the subject, he then stated Edith's
case. "You will know what she
needs," he concluded, "and I shall
see that she follows your directions."</p>

<p>The father questioned his young
catechumen, and found her in a state
of the most perfect ignorance. "The
child is a heathen!" he said, in his
odd, broken English, his smile taking
the harsh edge off the words. "She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
must study the catechism&mdash;this little
one&mdash;and see how much of it she
will have to say to me when I come
here again in a month. I will then
prepare her for her first confession."</p>

<p>Edith uttered not a word, except
to answer his questions. She was
not sure whether she liked him or
not; she was only certain that he
did not offend her.</p>

<p>There was a little more talk, then
Mr. Yorke rose to go, cordially inviting
the priest to visit him. As they
were going, "I think, Edith," he
said, "that you should kneel and
ask Father Rasle's blessing."</p>

<p>She knelt at once, for her mother's
and her uncle's sake, with a murmured,
"Please to bless me, sir!" But
when he had given the blessing, laying
his hand upon her head, and
looking down into her face with that
expression of serious sweetness, she
felt a dawning sense of reverence and
confidence, and perceived dimly some
sacredness in him.</p>

<p>She went to Mass the next day in
the little chapel that had been desecrated.
The picture-frames still hung
on the walls, with the rags of the
stations in them. There was enough
left to show how Christ the Lord
had suffered, and this new insult was
but a freshening of the original text.
Mr. Yorke sat on the bench beside
his niece, and she stood, or knelt, or
sat with the rest, not in the least understanding
what it all meant, but impressed
by the gravity and earnestness
of those around her. When
Mass was over, the priest, who had
seen them, sent for them into the
sacristy. He had some books for
Edith, and wanted to point out the
lessons she was to learn first.</p>

<p>"And I have a present for you,"
he said, giving her an ormolu crucifix,
with a broken foot that showed
marks of violence. "This is the
crucifix that was torn from our tabernacle.
I want you to keep it; and
whenever you are called upon to suffer,
and feel disposed to complain,
look at this, and remember that our
Lord was not even allowed to hang
upon his cross in peace."</p>

<p>She took the crucifix from his
hand silently, and held it against
her breast as she went out. She did
not propose to endure suffering; she
desired and looked for happiness;
but something in this relic stirred
her to a strange pity, mingled with
anger. The idea that lay behind it
was to her dim and vague; but, failing
to grasp that, she would have
defended with her life the symbol of
that monstrous wrong and that heart-breaking
patience. Reaching home,
she went directly to her own chamber
and hung the crucifix beneath
the picture of her father, then stood
and looked at it awhile. There was
a wish in her heart to do something&mdash;to
offer some reparation to the real
Sufferer behind this image of pain.
She kissed with soft lips the broken
foot of the cross, and a tear fell
where she kissed. She took it down,
and pressed the rough edge against
her bosom till the sharp points pierced
the skin and brought a stain of
blood. Then, hearing some one call
her, she hastily replaced it, and
brought as an offering to it a precious
bouquet of ribbon-grasses, that
Carl had gathered that morning to
fasten in her hair. She had meant
to keep it because of some sweetness
with which it was offered, but now
she gave it up to that unseen Patience
and Love. Her instinctive
action proved that the feeling and
precept of the church only sanctifies,
but does not change the impulse of
a pure and tender nature.</p>

<p>Meantime, the child was being discussed
down-stairs.</p>

<p>"I observe that Edith has an inclination
to stay alone a good deal,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
Mr. Yorke said, "and I do not wish
to have that encouraged. It is not a
wholesome disposition. Her father
was a visionary, her mother was a
visionary, and she is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A vision!" concluded Mrs. Yorke,
as Edith appeared, with the thoughts
of the last few hours still in her eyes
and on her lips.</p>

<p>About that time, Carl received a
letter from Miss Mills which he read
many times. "You ask my advice,"
she wrote, "and you tell me that I
know better than you know yourself.
I would not claim so much as that,
but I think I may tell you something
more clearly than you yourself perceive
it, or confirm you in some
thought which you doubt or wish
to doubt. As to your choice of a
profession and staying in Seaton for
the present, you might well try the
experiment; but I cannot express any
great confidence as to the result. It
is almost a disadvantage to you that
your powers are so various. There
are a good many things which, with
application, you could do excellently;
whether you have any specialty
remains to be proved, and will be
hard to prove; for, in order to find
that out, you must concentrate your
powers, and that you hate to do. If
this world were but a playground,
then you would have nothing to do
but follow in the trail of every new
beauty which calls you; but life is
earnest, and you must work, or you
not only lose what you might accomplish,
but you lose yourself. You
are one of those whom the devil finds
worth fighting for, and, lacking faith
to your armor, you have all the more
need of labor. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui laborat orat</i>,
might have a sort of truth even for
one without faith.</p>

<p>"Let me warn you against two
dangers: one is, that you may be
injured by flatterers. Not that you
like flattery in itself, but it will soothe
your painful sense of not having
reached your own ideal. It will
seem to you that your best must
have transpired at least, and that you
must have done better than you
thought. Not so; receive that soothing
praise only when you have striven
hard, even though you failed, but
never when you have tried weakly or
not at all. What the flatterers like
in you is not your best, but your
worst. They have no wish for you
to rise above them; they praise you
to keep you low.</p>

<p>"I warn you, too, against your
excessive love for the beautiful, in
which you are an ultra-pagan. The
infinite beauty is alone worthy of
that passion with which you seek
and admire; and infinite beauty is
infinite truth. Seek truth first, and
you will always be rewarded by the
vision of beauty; but, if you seek
beauty first, you will find to your
sorrow, possibly to your ruin, that it
is often but the mask of falsehood.</p>

<p>"Lay aside some of your fastidiousness,
my dear friend, and take up
your life strongly with both hands.
Do something, even if it should prove
to be the wrong thing. Wrong work
done honestly prepares us for right
work. Strengthen your will, and be
manly, as a man should be. Discipline
yourself, and you will escape
much pain and loss of time, for, let
me assure you, Carl, you need either
an immensity of resolution or an immensity
of suffering.</p>

<p>"My lecture is done, and I am
Minerva no longer. My thoughts
follow you with solicitude and indulgence.
On the night after you left,
which you spent on the sea, I went
to the quiet chapel near me, and
placed you under the protection of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Stella Maris</i>. But life has waves and
gulfs more fearful than those of the
sea, and my prayers for you do not
cease with the end of your journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look well at Robert Yorke's
child, remembering what the story
of my life is; and then, if you think
that I could love her, kiss her on the
forehead for me, and tell her that I
send a loving greeting."</p>

<p>Owen folded the letter, and hid it
in his bosom. He had been walking
in the woods, and he returned thoughtfully
homeward. The afternoon was
sultry and still. The low brooks
hissed along like white flames, the
branches drooped over the birds that
murmured, and the flowers hung
wilted. All about the house was
silent as he entered. Going through
the kitchen, he saw Betsey sitting in
the northern window reading a novel.
Betsey was the most romantic soul
alive, and, having got hold of <cite>David
Copperfield</cite>, was crying her eyes out
over poor little Dora. Passing on
to the sitting-room, he found his father
sitting asleep in a deep wicker-chair,
a copy of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Religio Medici</i> lying open
on his knee. The quiet tone of the
book, familiar by many readings, had
lulled him into a pleasant slumber,
and his hand had dropped with the
finger pointing to a passage on which
he had closed his eyes: "I love to
love myself in a mystery, to pursue
my reason to an <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">O altitudo</i>!" From
that the reader had gone out into
the mystery of sleep with a smile
lingering on his face.</p>

<p>"It is the castle of indolence,"
muttered Owen, stepping noiselessly
on. He paused at the foot of the
stairs and listened. No sound came
down. His sisters, in white wrappers,
each with a pillow under her
head, were lying on the cool matting
in the north chamber, too much exhausted
to talk. He went out into
the portico, and stood there a moment,
seeing no one. Then, turning,
he beheld Edith asleep on a bench
in the shadow of the vines, her arms
thrown up over her head. Smilingly
he approached her, literally to obey
the command of his friend, and look
well to see if his uncle's deserted
mistress could love his uncle's child.
She was fair enough to love, for all
the roughness of her former life had
passed away. The bloom of the lily
was in her face, warmed now to a
rose by the heat, and her hair had a
shine of gold.</p>

<p>"Dear little cousin," he said, "a
friend of yours sends loving greeting."</p>

<p>She stirred, her face grew troubled,
and she started up with a cry: "Dick,
come back. I did not mean to!"</p>

<p>She sighed on seeing Owen. "I
was dreaming that I had hurt Dick,
and he was going away angry," she
said.</p>

<p>"Are you, then, so fond of him?"
Carl asked, seating himself by her.</p>

<p>"O Carl!" she said earnestly, "you
have no idea how fond he is of me."</p>

<p>"And you of him, then, of course,"
said Carl.</p>

<p>"Why, of course!" she echoed,
with a look of surprise. "If I were
to do anything to Dick to make him
unhappy, I should never forgive myself,
never! I have written him a
letter to-day, and told him I want
him to be a Catholic."</p>

<p>"You have!" said Carl with a
faint smile. "Do you think he will
obey you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," she said confidently;
"I told him some good reasons why
he should."</p>

<p>And may I ask what the good reasons
were, Edith?" was the smiling
question.</p>

<p>"Why, in the first place, I want
him to."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" laughed the young
man. "The doctors couldn't do
better."</p>

<p>Edith blushed deeply. "No; the
good reasons were the reasons why I
wanted him to," she said.</p>

<h2>SAINT CECILIA.<br />

<small>HER INFLUENCE ON LITERATURE AND THE ARTS.</small></h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE REVUE GENERALE.</p>


<p>While the great men who have
dreamed of distinguishing their
names die and are forgotten, or at
least, as Juvenal said of Alexander,
become the idle theme of a rhetorical
recitation, those who in this world
have lived and suffered for God
leave behind them, through all ages,
an immortal memory.</p>

<p>The work for which each of us has
been sent into the world has been
conspicuously accomplished by the
saints. This makes them our rightful
masters; and, while we rarely
imitate them, we can at least understand
that such heroism must elevate
the soul, and we admire them all the
more that we feel ourselves unable to
follow in their steps. Nor is such a
recognition a useless sentiment.
From the mansion of glory whence
they see all things, the saints never
cease to interest themselves in the
affairs of the world, and among the
dogmas of the Catholic Church
which our estranged brethren have
rejected, the communion of saints is
one of the most touching and
sublime.</p>

<p>There is indeed between the two
worlds, visible and invisible, a strange
but undeniable communication. Each
of us, in investigating his own soul,
will find there certain phenomena
which have their origin neither in
ourselves nor in the outer world:
sadness from no apparent cause, inexplicable
sensations of internal
happiness, bursts of enthusiasm or
sudden inspirations which Plato attributed
to superior intelligences.
Many of us, recalling some miraculously
escaped danger, and profoundly
touched by this heavenly protection,
will bear willing witness, unless checked
by dread of worldly criticism, to
this influence of the saints and angels
on our human career. "The people,"
with the good sense which so happily
inspires them (at least, where the
sophists have not succeeded in corrupting
them)&mdash;"the people" believe
in it; and when the peasant or the
poor working-woman gives a name
in baptism to the child just entering
on the struggles of life, she believes,
in her simple, lucid faith, that she
is securing a patron for it. It is not
in vain, they say, that a young girl
is called Mary; surely she will the
more readily share in the sweetness,
the self-denial, the incomparable
purity, of the Queen of Virgins; the
name of Agnes will be a pledge of
innocence; that of Theresa promises
a heart of fire; that of Cecilia, a soul
gentle yet strong, eager for harmony;
while the name of Francis recalls
heroic isolation; those of Paul and
of John, indefatigable zeal and perfect
charity. If it is not always thus,
it is because the human soul is free
to resist grace; but these occasional
rebellions do not prevent a harmony
between heaven and earth as mysterious
as it is sure.</p>

<p>These thoughts have frequently
passed through our mind; but one
day last October, while visiting the
church of St. Cecilia in Rome, they
monopolized it.</p>

<p>In such moments, we persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
ourselves very easily that we can
express them in writing. Undoubtedly,
they are not new; but, if the
life of this great saint, one of the
glories of Rome, is well known, it is
a story which will bear repetition:
really fine old melodies never lose
their charm, and, if they thrill one
human soul with a divine emotion,
who will complain of hearing them
again?</p>


<h3>HISTORY OF SAINT CECILIA.</h3>

<p>In the year 250 after Christ, in
the reign of Septimus Severus, at a
time when the Roman Empire was
still the most formidable power of
the world, there lived in Rome a
young girl who will be famous when
the imperial glories shall be forgotten.</p>

<p>Beauty, the reflection of heaven
in the human countenance; grace,
mysterious charm whose origin is invisible;
modesty, that exquisite reserve
of a virgin soul; nobility,
precious perfume of the past; and,
above all, the power of loving, the
most magnificent and the most
powerful present of the Creator to
the created: all these gifts were
united in the daughter of Cæcilius.
It was an illustrious family: in the
records of the Republic it counted
eighteen consuls and several conquerors,
nor had it degenerated under
the Empire.</p>

<p>To-day, when the traveller, weary
from a day spent in the galleries of
Rome, setting forth from the city
towards sunset, wanders pensively
down the long Appian Way, while he
contemplates with emotion the outlines
of the aqueducts with their
broken arches, the Sabine mountains
gilded by the light, and all that celebrated
landscape of the environs of
Rome, majestic and melancholy as a
fallen queen, he finds upon his right,
rising like a great tower, the tomb of
Cæcilia Metella. There slept of yore
the long-forgotten ancestress of her
who will render immortal, for time
and for eternity, the name of
Cæcilius.</p>

<p>Cecilia was eighteen. The Roman
poor knew her charity. Often had
they seen her in the caves of the
martyrs alone, or only accompanied
by a faithful servant. Her father,
although he respected her religion,
did not share it: he hoped, indeed, at
a suitable time to marry his daughter
to some distinguished husband, and
to see himself, through her, live again
in her beloved children. But Cecilia
had raised her heart above this
world, and night and day prayed that
the palm of virginity she had dreamed
of should not be taken from her.</p>

<p>He whom her parents had chosen
for her seemed not unworthy of the
honor. Though still a pagan, Valerian
possessed at least those natural
gifts which prepare the soul for faith,
hope, and charity, the supernatural
gifts of Christ crucified. Nevertheless,
who can express the fears of the
young Christian? Had not God
accepted all her heart as she had offered
it? Could a pagan understand
this mystery, and would not this
union of the soul with an invisible
spouse seem a strange folly to a man
still living in the world of the senses?
More than one Christian soul has felt
these chaste doubts. It is honorable
to hesitate before making for a mortal
a sacrifice for which a young girl
sometimes can never console herself.
Cecilia felt these terrors most acutely,
but she loved God well enough to
feel perfect confidence in him. So
she poured forth her whole soul in
prayer, and, against all hope, trusted
in his aid.</p>

<p>So, when, towards evening, already
married in the eyes of the world, she
found herself alone with her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
she said to him in that incomparable
conversation whose charm
has come down to us in her life:</p>

<p>"There is a secret, Valerian, that
I wish to confide to you. I have a
lover, an angel of God, who watches
over me with jealous care. If you
preserve inviolate my virginity, he
will love you also as he loves me,
and will overpower you with his
favors."</p>

<p>Much astonished, Valerian wished
to know this angel.</p>

<p>"You shall see him," said Cecilia,
"when you are purified."</p>

<p>"How shall I become so?"</p>

<p>"Go to Urban. When the poor
hear my name, they will take you to
his sanctuary: he will explain to you
our mysteries."</p>

<p>Drawn by an unknown power, the
young man consented to go. We
know the result of this decision&mdash;his
interview with the Pope in the catacombs,
his conversion, and his baptism.
Still dressed in his white robe,
he returned to Cecilia. He could
now understand the love of the angels,
and its perfect beauty. In future, he
loved Cecilia as his sister in God, to
whom belong the heart and mind.</p>

<p>In those Christian ages others loved
as he did. Undoubtedly most of
them carried their secret with them
to the tomb; but among those whose
genius has made them famous, Dante
had his Beatrice; Petrarch sang of
Laura: and these pure loves, unknown
to the ancient pagans, and
scoffed at by our modern pagans, will
remain an ornament to the soul, an
act of faith in its immortality, and
for us who read their history a breath
of heaven on earth.</p>

<p>No one knows what conversation
took place, in those hours of rapture
and prayer, between this pair, whose
marriage was to be perfected in
heaven; what thanksgivings they
rendered to God, who in a moment
transforms hearts: nor would it be
easy to describe. Of all the arts,
music alone might perhaps dare to
attempt it, and the revelation would
require the genius of Handel or
Beethoven.</p>

<p>In his ardent zeal, Valerian, like
Cecilia, understood the value of the
soul.</p>

<p>So, when the beloved brother
Tiburtius sought them, what eloquence
they displayed to prove to
him that his gods were only idols!
Subdued by the mysterious charm of
the Christian virgin, conquered by
the eagerness of the convert, Tiburtius
also wished to see the angel
who watched over Cecilia. If for
this it was necessary to be purified,
purified he would be; and thus became
the first conquest of his brother,
who had besought God for it.</p>

<p>Such souls were too beautiful for
pagan Rome. In the absence of
Septimus Severus, Almachius, the
governor, summoned Valerian and
Tiburtius before his tribunal. The
two young patricians avowed their
faith in Christ, to the great scandal
of the worldly and prosperous. Valerian
went to his martyrdom as to a
triumph. He went to wait for Cecilia
in heaven.</p>

<p>Tiburtius did not forsake him. On
the Appian Way, four miles from the
city, they were beheaded for having
dared to worship a different God
from those of the Empire. Cecilia
piously reclaimed their bodies, and
prepared to rejoin them. Called in
her turn to answer for her conduct,
she disconcerted the judge. Before
such purity, innocence, and heroism,
entreaties, artifices, and threats failed;
the daughter of Cæcilius, convicted
of loving the poor and a crucified
God, was instantly confined in the
bath-room of her own house, there
to be suffocated in a hot vapor bath.
But in the midst of this fiery atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
she remained uninjured. The
stupefied jailers related how they had
discovered her singing the praises of
God. Such a delusion could but
provoke Almachius. The executioner
was summoned. With a trembling
hand, he inflicted three wounds on
the neck of the virgin martyr, without
succeeding in severing the head.
Then, terrified himself, he fled.
Stretched on the flags, bathed in
her blood, Cecilia lived three days.
The Christians gathered round her.
She was able to bid farewell to the
poor, to whom she had bequeathed
her property. Then, feeling her
strength fail, while Urban was in
the act of giving her his blessing, she
drew her robe around her, and, turning
her face away, gave back her soul
to God.</p>

<p>According to her last desire, the
Pope transformed the house that had
witnessed her martyrdom into a
church. The bath-room became a
chapel; and by its arrangement bears
witness to-day to the truth of the
saint's life. One can still see the
mouth of the pipes which let in the
vapor, covered with a grating; and
on the same flags where the Roman
virgin expired, the kneeling Christian
can ponder in his heart the example
of heroism that she has given to the
world. He who has not had the good
fortune to pray on the tombs of
the martyrs cannot appreciate the
strength one finds there, or what precepts
their relics give forth. The
martyrs are the incontrovertible witnesses
of the value of faith, of the
power of love; and it is said that
their beatified spirits lend to these
bones, which were their bodies, an
all-powerful eloquence.</p>

<p>The remains of the young girl were
taken down into the catacombs of St.
Callixtus, and remained there six
centuries. After the invasion of the
Lombards, most unhappily, all trace
was lost of them till, in 822, the place
where they were hidden was revealed
to Pope St. Pascal.</p>

<p>The long-sought coffin was placed
in the basilica of St. Cecilia, which
had been repaired by the Pope's care.
It was placed under the high altar.
And even in our day the custodian
points out to the pilgrim a curious
fresco of the thirteenth century, representing
the apparition of the saint to
the sleeping Pope. In 1599, Cardinal
Sfondrate ordered the tomb to be
opened with solemnity. To the great
delight of Christian Rome, the corpse
of the Roman virgin, respected by
centuries, appeared, miraculously preserved.</p>

<p>The chaste folds of her dress were
restrained by a girdle. At her feet
were found the blood-stained cloths
which had bound her wounds; and
her arms, thrust forward, still seemed
to serve as a veil. Three fingers of
her right hand were open, only one
of the left, as if even in dying she
had wished to avow her belief in one
God in three persons. Finally, so
that she might not give to the world
her last look, but think only of Christ,
her spouse, by a supreme effort she
had turned her head aside.</p>

<p>Thus she reposes on her bier of
cypress; thus extended on the flags
she had died; and thus a great artist
has faithfully represented her to us.
The celebrated statue of Etienne
Maderno, lying on its side, full of
modesty and of grace, seems the
dying virgin herself; and the whiteness
of the marble, which so resembles
the paleness of death, adds yet more
to the illusion. Seen in this honored
place, in this house which was the
saint's and has become God's, this
masterpiece of Christian sculpture,
admirably executed and in exquisite
taste, touches the heart profoundly.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF ST. CECILIA ON
LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>Such a beautiful story could not
fail to be repeated. As long as the
persecutions lasted, to strengthen
their courage, the faithful passed from
mouth to mouth these details which
had been so affectionately collected.
So great, indeed, was the enthusiasm
for the memory of Cecilia that she
obtained the great and rare honor of
being mentioned in the canon of the
Mass with Saints Felicitas, Perpetua,
Agatha, Lucy, Agnes, and Anastasia.
Thus for fifteen centuries, throughout
the Catholic world, wherever the holy
sacrifice is celebrated, her name is
invoked; and, truly immortal, each
hour, each moment perhaps, her
memory rises from earth to heaven
with incense and with prayer.</p>

<p>Her acts, chronicled in the fifth
century, have since then been the
subject of several works. We shall
only mention the Greek translation
of Simeon Metaphrastes, the verses
of St. Adhelme and of the Venerable
Bede in England, the works of
Flodoard at Rheims, and Rhoban
Maur. Then, during that magnificent
efflorescence of philosophy and
Catholic literature, we see Victor de
Beauvais relate the story of St. Cecilia;<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Albert the Great, St. Thomas
Aquinas, St. Bonaventure, preaching
several sermons in her honor. In
the fifteenth century, the eloquent St.
Vincent Ferrer recited her praises;
but the Reformation came soon after,
and it is only in Italy now that they
think of the glories of St. Cecilia.</p>

<p>In vain her history is its own defence;
in vain may it claim in its
favor the imposing testimony of
Christian tradition, in the East as in
the West, during fourteen centuries;
in vain the liturgies of the churches
of Rome, of Milan, of Toledo, of
Greece, and of Gaul have inserted
in the office for the 22d of November
fragments of the text; in vain even
the discovery of her body testified
anew to its veracity. Towards the
middle of the seventeenth century,
the Jansenist school rejected it.</p>

<p>The historical works on the first
centuries of Christianity which during
the last forty years have been
undertaken in France and Germany,
by tracing out the original sources
with scrupulous care, and taking advantage
of monuments, have dealt
justly with this excessive criticism.</p>

<p>But error is more prone to spread
than easy to uproot. Launoy, that
"great demolisher of saints," who, in
attacking the most poetic beliefs of
the faithful, strayed into the road to
rationalism, made a school. Even
now Feller's <cite>Dictionary of Universal
Biography</cite>, and, following him (for
these works usually copy each other),
those of Michaud and of F. Didot,
have repeated, on the authority of Tillemont
and of Baillet, that the authenticity
of the life of St. Cecilia is very
doubtful, although the arguments
cited in support of this thesis had
been successfully refuted by Laderchi
early in the eighteenth century,<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and
annihilated for ever twenty years ago
by R. P. Dom Guéranger, in his excellent
book on St. Cecilia.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The touching story of St. Cecilia
must also inspire poets. Without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>mentioning the ancient hymns to be
found in the Italian, Spanish, and
Gallic liturgies, several poems in her
honor may be quoted. At the time
of the Renaissance, Baptiste Spagnuolo
made it the subject of a real
epic poem, where we find, as in the
<cite>Æneid</cite>, the speeches of Venus and
Juno, and the conspiracies of the inhabitants
of Olympus against common
mortals. The god of pagan
love, accompanied by his mother,
comes sadly to Juno to complain of
the disdain of Cecilia, who wishes to
remain a virgin. Forgetting her resentment,
the wife of Jupiter inspires
the father of Cecilia with the idea of
uniting his daughter to a pagan.
Foiled in their attempt by the conversion
of Valerian, the angry goddess
instigated Mars to suggest to Almachius
the plan of drowning in blood
this Christian band, rebels against
the Olympian gods. Among the
nine hundred verses may be found
some fine ones, but we must confess
that these unfortunate pagan reminiscences,
so popular in the sixteenth
century, ruin the poet's work for us.</p>

<p>Happily, the Roman virgin was to
have her life, her death, and her
glories sung in poems of purer inspiration.
Angelus Tangrinus, priest
of Monte Cassino,<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> wrote on this
subject a long epithalamium,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> which
lacks neither grace of expression nor
of thought.</p>

<p>The English poet Pope has also
written an ode to St. Cecilia. The
poem is elegantly versified, but cold
and unmarked by any Christian feeling.
The classic author recalls the
magical effect of music in all ages,
nor has he forgotten the adventure of
Eurydice; he speaks with complacency
of the Styx and of Phlegethon,
of Ixion and of Sisyphus, of Proserpine
and the Elysian Fields. Finally,
feeling a pang of remorse, and remembering
that he had dedicated his
ode to a virgin martyr, he asserts
that the poets must instantly abandon
Orpheus and proclaim Cecilia the
queen of music; for if the musician
of Thrace drew by his music a spirit
from hell, Cecilia by hers raised the
soul to heaven.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Very recently, Count Anatole de
Ségur has published a dramatic
poem, which seems to us the finest
homage that poetry has yet offered
to St. Cecilia. The style pure and
musical, the interest sustained and
engrossing, it merits the praises which
the best judges have bestowed on it;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
and we should willingly quote some
verses of this exquisite book,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> did
we not prefer to leave our readers
the pleasure of perusing it as a whole.</p>


<h3>THE INFLUENCE OF SAINT CECILIA ON
THE FINE ARTS.</h3>

<p>We have seen the story of St. Cecilia
inspire eloquence and poetry,
but it was destined to exercise a still
greater influence on the fine arts.
There are, indeed, some general
rules for these intimate relations between
art and holiness that it would
be well to remember. Besides, we
may say that the saints were themselves
powerful artists. Who has
sought the ideal more eagerly than
these indefatigable lovers of heavenly
things? But they have not contented
themselves with seeking infinite
beauty in an abstract form;
they have endeavored, as far as it
was possible to human weakness, to
realize it in their lives. As the sculptor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>cuts into a block of marble to
render it into beautiful forms, they,
with obstinate labor, have sought to
model their souls, to render them
more pure, less unworthy of God.
The contemplation of martyrdom, so
habitual to the first Christians, gave
them that serene dignity now become
so rare. As a bride prepares
herself for the bridegroom, so did
these souls of virgins, of mothers, of
the young and of the old, endeavor,
day by day, to grow in grace in the
eyes of Jesus Christ, till the blade of
the executioner harvested them for
heaven. The soul, grown beautiful,
transfigures in its turn the body which
it animates, and the living mirror of
the countenance reflects strength and
gentleness, peace and ardent zeal,
purity and ecstatic rapture. Thus
we may fairly conclude that Christianity
has offered to artists, through
the saints, not only the perfection of
form, but a type of human beauty
elevated by an ever-constant love.</p>

<p>But why was St. Cecilia singled
out from such an innumerable band
of the beatified to become especially
dear to artists? Many others, gifted
with all worldly advantages, in all
the radiance of youth and beauty,
died, like her, virgins and martyrs,
without attaining her distinction. We
will examine later the motives of the
musicians in taking her for their patron.
As for the artists, they had no
long discussion on the causes of this
secret sympathy. Each one, when
he dreamed of heaven, painted Cecilia,
saying to himself, probably, that
there was not in the world a young
girl's face which could so perfectly
express the rapture of the soul listening
to ineffable harmony.</p>

<p>It would require time to glance
even hastily over the long gallery of
pictures of which our saint has been
the subject. We will only mention
the most celebrated. It is probable
that many, scattered through the
many galleries of Europe, have escaped
us; but we wish only to discuss
those which we have appreciated
with our own eyes, and, also,
the limits of this article would prevent
our attempting to mention
all.</p>

<p>In order to preserve some regularity
in this examination, and that
it may not become an adventurous
journey through all ages and countries
in search of pictures of St. Cecilia,
we will separate these works into
three classes, and, according to their
nature and their predominant tendencies,
we will class them, one by
one, in the sensualistic, rationalistic,
and mystical schools.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Nevertheless,
we must say that here, as in
all other classification, the confines
of each class are very apt to mingle
with each other. Sometimes, indeed,
in the same picture one figure
will express sensuality and the others
religious emotion.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>But let us render judgment on the
entire effect of the picture and its predominant
tendency. We must repeat
here that in all artistic works we note
two things: first, the idea of the artist,
and, in consequence, the order of
psychological effect&mdash;sensual pleasures,
spiritual joy, or heartfelt rapture&mdash;which
the picture gives rise to
in the souls of those who behold it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>secondly, the execution, the dexterity,
more or less perfect, with
which the idea has been expressed,
and, consequently, the greater or
less satisfaction felt by connoisseurs,
whom a special education has fitted
to appreciate the technical merits or
faults of a picture. These are two
widely different points of view; and,
to be just, one should specify from
which standpoint a picture is judged,
for it might easily happen that the
spirit of a picture would be really
beautiful and the execution very feeble;
the coloring perhaps unpleasing,
the perspective faulty, or even the
drawing incorrect.</p>

<p>First, The sensual school. Among
the greatest geniuses, Rubens, perhaps,
falls oftenest into sensualism.
It is to the senses, indeed, that he usually
addresses himself; hence the vividness
of his coloring, the brilliancy
of the flesh, which seems palpitating
with life and ready to rebound under
the critic's finger. But, indeed, except
"The Descent from the Cross" and
"The Elevation of the Cross," nothing
could be less religious than
most of his religious pictures. In
vain his "St. Cecilia" passionately
raises her eyes; her plumpness and
her dress wake only worldly thoughts.
Others may admire the intensity of
the flesh tints, the lustre of the robes.
We think such exuberant health little
suited to the young Christian who
watched and fasted the more entirely
to give herself up to prayer. As for
the pouting cherubs which frolic
round her, they are not adapted for
inspiring heavenly aspirations.</p>

<p>But let us look no longer to the
sensual school for a type of beauty
which it cannot give us. Let us see
how St. Cecilia has been understood
by those artists who, without troubling
themselves much to express
Christian ideas, have, at least, endeavored
to satisfy the intelligence
and to appeal to the mind through
the eyes.</p>

<p>Second, The rationalistic school.
Of all the painters whom we class
under the name of the rationalistic
school (that is, spiritual without being
Christian), Domenichino is the
most celebrated, or, at least, the one
who has consecrated the most important
works to the glory of St. Cecilia.
His frescoes in the church
of St. Louis des Français, at Rome,
are considered classics. There we
see St. Cecilia distributing, from the
terrace of her house, her garments to
a crowd of poor people, who, in picturesque
groups, are disputing over
them. Then, Almachius, on his
judgment-seat, commanding, by an
imperative gesture, the saint to sacrifice
to the idols. But she expresses
with dignity her horror; and it is in
vain for the priests to offer a goat,
and in vain incense smokes on a tripod
before a statue of Jupiter. Here
Cecilia dies, surrounded by kneeling
women; some watching her, others
putting the blood from her wounds
into vases by the aid of sponges. In
the meanwhile, the Pope, Urban,
gives her his blessing, and an angel
brings her, from heaven, a crown
and a palm. In yet another fresco,
an angel presents crowns to Cecilia
and Valerian. And last, on the ceiling
is painted the apotheosis of the
saint supported in the arms of angels,
and borne to heaven.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>But Domenichino's picture in the
great gallery of the Louvre is more
generally known than the frescoes
of St. Louis. Here St. Cecilia is
standing, and while she sings the
glories of God, accompanying herself
on a violoncello, an angel offers
her a music-book. But she does
not heed it, and raises to heaven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>eyes that seem just melting in tears.
Undoubtedly the head is truly dignified
and inspired, but we must regret
that the religious sentiment is not
more manifest in this fine picture, for
without the nimbus round the head
one might take the saint for a sibyl.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>Guido, with his usual grace, has
represented Cecilia dying, lying on
her side, as in Maderno's statue.
She has, however, her arms crossed
upon her breast, and the head is not
turned aside; two women staunch
her bleeding wounds with cloths, and
in the background an angel holds a
palm, which he hastens to give her.</p>

<p>To Annibal Carracci is usually attributed
the St. Cecilia which is to
be found in the Museum of the Capitol
at Rome. At all events, one
easily recognizes, by a certain shade
of naturalism, a work of the Bologna
school. As before, the saint is singing
and accompanying herself on an
organ; but here, we see beside her
the Blessed Virgin holding the infant
Jesus in her arms, and a Dominican
priest&mdash;expressive faces, apparently
enraptured with the celestial
concert.</p>

<p>The majority of French artists,
above all in the reign of Louis XIV.,
belong to the rationalistic school.
Their composition is clever, their
drawing correct, the style dignified,
sometimes almost theatrical. They are
indeed almost always natural, but
with the exception of some of Lesueur's,
one rarely perceives in their
works the inspiration of a superhuman
emotion. There are in the galleries
of French art in the Louvre
two pictures which do not contradict
these observations. Jacques Stella,
who lived during the first half of
the seventeenth century, has left us
a St. Cecilia. She is standing playing
on an organ, her eyes modestly
lowered, while two angels are singing
at her side. She wears a wreath
of roses in her hair; but, more charming
than inspired, resembles the portrait
of a young girl of the age of
Louis XIII. with a taste for music.</p>

<p>Mignard's picture is, however,
more celebrated. Of finished execution,
perfect in detail, so that
even the glimpse of landscape seen
through the pillars of the portico is
treated with great care, it inspires
artists with admiration also by the
beauty of its coloring. The saint,
richly dressed, and wearing a large
turban, which gives her a very oriental
look, is seated playing on the
harp. No wonder that this picture
pleased the king, or that he desired
it to adorn his collection. Unfortunately,
all this magnificence fails to
move us. We see the Persian sibyl
executing a prelude to her oracles, but
nothing reminds us of Rome and the
early martyrs, and neither in the piteous
figures nor in those up-raised eyes
can we trace any Christian feeling.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>Third, the mystical school. Beyond
the region of the senses and of that
which usually bounds the human
spirit, opens the supernatural and divine
world. One cannot enter here
without a pure heart, and to enjoy
its beauty we must by prayer and
humility, those two wings of the soul,
rise above ourselves and transitory
things. Thus the mystical school of
art, disdained by hypercritical connoisseurs,
requires a sort of moral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>preparation, and might write above
its door, as a salutary warning, "Let
none enter here save him who loves
God entirely." It is here that we
must finally seek the type of St. Cecilia
in all its supernatural beauty: a
human face illuminated by ecstasy.</p>

<p>We shall only mention, for the satisfaction
of antiquaries, the St. Cecilia
of Cimabue at the entrance to the
magnificent Uffizi Gallery at Florence.
This also is a type of the Byzantine
virgin, not however without a certain
majesty in its stiffness. Far more
celestial is the impression left on us
by the St. Cecilia of blessed Fra Angelico
da Fiesole, in that wonderful
picture of the "<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Incoronazione della
Vergine</span>," which so worthily commences
the great gallery of the
Louvre. Cecilia is in the foreground,
close to St. Magdalen, recognizable
by her long golden hair.
Entirely absorbed in the contemplation
of Christ, and indifferent to the
world, she turns away, so that one
sees only the long blue mantle and
the crown of roses, emblems of virginity,
which encircles her head.
Nevertheless, the lost profile which
we can only glance at is not without
grace, and suggests a countenance
radiant with love and purity.</p>

<p>To the mystical school also may
be attributed five little pictures by
Pinturicchio in the gallery at Berlin,
which were much admired by Dom
Guéranger. Undoubtedly, Pinturicchio
has none of Cimabue's stiffness;
we willingly acknowledge his ease
and natural grace; but how far he is
from the angelic touch of Beato, or
the perfection of Raphael!</p>

<p>Perhaps Bologna contains the
largest array of fine pictures. In
the chapel of St. Cecilia, behind St.
Giacomo Maggiore, ten admirable
frescoes represent the entire history
of St. Cecilia. By the hand of Francesco
Francia himself, we have her
marriage with Valerian, and her funeral;
six other scenes were painted
by his pupils, G. Francia, Chiodarolo,
and Aspertini. The two representing
Pope Urban instructing Tiburtius,
and the virgin distributing her property
to the poor, are considered
Lorenzo Casta's masterpieces. But
it is to the Museum one must turn
to admire the St. Cecilia of Raphael,
one of the most beautiful of pictures,
and certainly the most splendid homage
offered by art to the Roman
virgin. It was to be seen in Paris
from 1798 till 1815, when it was
taken back to Bologna; and it is
well worth a voyage across the Alps.
Letting fall the organ she still retains
in her hands, St. Cecilia stands,
seeming to listen in ecstasy to the
concert of angels, contemplating this
transporting choir, which the artist
has revealed in the yawning skies.
At her side stand St. John, St. Paul,
St. Magdalen, and St. Augustine;
at her feet lie the broken instruments
of earthly music. Apparently Raphael
wished to recapitulate on this
sublime page the highest precepts of
philosophy. Here is typified by the
instruments of pleasure the world
of the senses, whose bonds we must
break and free ourselves from. But
if it is well to know something of
this material world, the realm of the
human intellect, it is necessary sometimes
to know, like Cecilia, how to
raise one's self still higher and prepare
to listen to the ineffable music of the
soul. Do we accuse ourselves of
being sinners? Here is Magdalen
with her vase of ointment, and behind
her Augustine. They may well
inspire us with hope, they also have
experienced the temptations of the
senses and the proud rebellions of
the will, but there they stand to prove
that humility and penitence may conquer
these. Do you say that, obliged
to lead an active life, you daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
find yourself overwhelmed by a thousand
cares? Behold St. Paul, the
apostle of nations, who also experienced
pain, labor, shipwrecks, and
dangers of all kinds; nevertheless,
leaning on his sword, he meditates.
Finally, are you philosophers or theologians?
Behold St. John, the master
of you all. Radiant, he contemplates
the enraptured saint, and seems
to say, "Forget yourselves for a
space; turn from the sound of human
words; like Cecilia, listen to the celestial
harmonies of the Word. Look
at this young girl. She has known
how to find love, peace, and happiness."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>According to M. Passavant,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> it was
also the history of St. Cecilia, and
not the martyrdom of St. Felicitas,
as is usually believed, which formed
the subject of Raphael's fresco, formerly
to be admired in the chapel
"De la Magliano" at Trastavere.
In 1830, an unknown vandal of a
proprietor bethought himself of cutting
a huge gash through the centre
in order to place a "pew, where he
could hear Mass without mingling
with his servants!" Thus mutilated,
the fresco was transferred to canvas
in 1835, and has probably been
bought by some more enlightened
connoisseur; but the most enthusiastic
appreciation cannot now repair
such outrages.</p>

<p>Among the moderns, we shall only
mention, in Germany, the St. Cecilia
of Molitor, whose attitude reminds
us much of Raphael's. Certainly it
has not the same nobility of style,
but we find there the charming
grace of the Düsseldorf school. In
France, we may mention with praise
the St. Cecilia of Paul Delaroche.
Seated on an antique chair, dressed
in a robe falling in long folds, the
virgin with one hand restrains her
mantle, bordered with a fringe of gold,
with the other she touches a little
organ presented to her by two kneeling
angels, under the semblance of
pure-faced boys. This sweet picture,
full of poetry and grace, is a happy
contrast to some others, and makes
us the more regret the painter of this
Christian martyr, so beautiful and
chaste&mdash;night brooding on the face
of the waters.</p>

<p>But of one art St. Cecilia is especially
the patron, and that is music.
Why the Roman virgin was
chosen from so many others, would
be very difficult to explain with any
precision. The mystic sense of the
tradition which makes Cecilia the
queen of harmony is now lost, and
on this point we are reduced to conjectures.
Let us hope, however, that
the conjectures we shall advance
may seem probable after a little reflection.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly Cecilia, the daughter
of a noble family, enjoying all worldly
advantages and instructed to please,
was taught music. Without doubt,
also, she consecrated to God a talent
acquired for worldly ends; and in
the meetings of the faithful in the
catacombs she must have taken part
in the psalms and canticles. But
the most weighty argument in favor
of this glorious patronage which the
Christian ages have ascribed to our
saint, is the sentence from her life incorporated
in the Roman Litany:
"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cantantibus organis, Cæcilia Domino
decantabat: Fiat cor meum immaculatum
ut non confundar</span>."</p>

<p>In January, 1732, a Jansenist critic,
otherwise entirely unknown,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> remarked,
in the <cite>Mercury</cite> of France,
"that the selection of St. Cecilia as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>the patron of music was not a good
choice." Indeed, he says, a little farther
on, "we can easily see that this
saint was very insensible to the
charms of music; for on her wedding
day, while they played on several
instruments, she remained absorbed
in prayer."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Poor man! he could
not get beyond the outer husks of
things, and the material side of art.
He did not know that elevated natures
naturally respond to human
music by prayer, that heavenly music.
And undoubtedly, he had never
heard those sublime melodies which
a loving soul sings to itself, and of
which the most beautiful concerts of
this world are but a feeble echo.</p>

<p>But the Christian people had a
better inspiration. They understood
that music, and, above all, religious
music&mdash;the most beautiful of all,
whose highest aim is to free us from
the senses and lift us out of ourselves,
in order to raise us to God&mdash;might
well be protected by this young girl,
whose soul had become like a lyre,
from which the faintest breath will
wake harmonious vibrations, and
who, virgin and martyr&mdash;while for
three days she lay on the bloody
flags, seemed in a long song of love
to render back her spirit.</p>

<p>In Rome and Italy, musical societies
early placed themselves under
the patronage of St. Cecilia. We
find one in France, founded in 1571,
at Evreux, "by the choristers of the cathedral
church, and other pious inhabitants
of this city, for the purpose
of learning music." Henry III.
gave letters patent to the "Society
of Madame St. Cecilia," established
at Paris, in the church of the
"Grands Augustins," by zealous artists
and amateurs of music. These
societies disappeared with many others
in the revolutionary troubles, but their
charitable intentions have been revived.
Every year, on the 22d of November,
the Association of Musical Artists
gives in the great church of St. Eustache
at Paris a musical mass,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> whose
proceeds are destined to relieve their
sick and poor members. Undoubtedly
one might often wish more religious
music. These pretended masses are far
too theatrical to seem much inspired
when compared to the oratorios
which Handel and Beethoven have
dedicated to St. Cecilia. Nor is it
there that one could find pious meditation.
Nevertheless, we may still
rejoice that at a time when materialism
has corrupted so many hearts,
these solemnities still attract crowds.
Indeed, one may say of music as Tertullian
said of the soul, that it is naturally
Christian. To draw the soul from
all that occupies it, weighs on it, and
destroys it, to sustain it by prolonged
melody, inspiring dreams of infinity,
is also to elevate it above itself,
and gently prepare it for the broken
utterances of prayer.</p>

<p>We know, then, that St. Cecilia is
powerful enough in heaven to turn
an idler into yet another Christian.
Never in vain was she approached
while on earth, or her memory
celebrated since she has reigned in
heaven. She has held her court of
littérateurs, poets, painters, and musicians,
men with impassioned hearts,
which she has gently drawn toward
heaven. For each she has obtained
some special grace. Let others
come; for the treasures she distributes
are never exhausted.</p>

<p>In the early Christians who read
her history, she inspired love of purity
and a martyr's strength; to the artists
who have striven to represent
her, she has revealed a type of beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>unknown on earth. For the most
humble of her servants, she has
smiles which heal the soul wonderfully.
Who has inspired more masterpieces?
who has been more loved
than this virgin? who is more alive
than she, who has been dead for sixteen
centuries? But, martyr to love,
she died for Christ. Is this really
dying?</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF CIVILIZATION.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></h2>


<p>Sir John Lubbock, though his
name is not euphonious, is, we understand,
an English scientist, highly
distinguished and of no mean authority
in the scientific world, as his father
was before him. He certainly
is a man of large pretensions, and of
as much logical ability and practical
good sense as we have a right to expect
in an English scientist. He, of
course, adopts the modern theory of
progress, and maintains that the savage
is the type of the primitive man,
and that he has emerged from his
original barbarism and superstition
to his present advanced civilization
and religious belief and worship by
his own energy and persevering efforts
at self-evolution or development,
without any foreign or supernatural
instruction or assistance.</p>

<p>One, Sir John contends, has only
to study and carefully ascertain the
present condition of the various contemporary
savage tribes, or what he
calls the "lower races," to know what
was the original condition of mankind,
and from which the superior
races started on their tour of progress
through the ages; and one needs only
to ascertain the germs of civilization
and religion which were in their original
condition, to be able to comprehend
the various stages of that progress
and the principles and means
by which it has been effected and
may be carried on indefinitely beyond
the point already reached.
Hence, in the volume before us the
author labors to present us a true
picture of the present mental and social
condition of contemporary savages
as that of the primeval man.
He assumes that the mental and social
condition is that of the infancy of
the human race, and by studying it
we can attain to the history of "prehistoric"
times, assist, as it were, if we
may be pardoned the Gallicism, at the
earliest development of mankind, and
trace step by step the progress from
their first appearance on the globe
upward to the sublime civilization of
the nineteenth century&mdash;the civilization
of the steam-engine, the cotton
spinner and weaver, the steamboat,
the steam-plough, the railway, and
the lightning telegraph.</p>

<p>This theory, that finds in the savage
the type of the primitive man, is
nothing very new. It was refuted
by the late Archbishop Whately, by
the Duke of Argyll in his <cite>Primeval
Man</cite>, and on several occasions
by the present writer in <span class="smcap">The Catholic
World</span>. The facts Sir John adduces
in the support of this theory,
as far as facts they are, had been
adduced long ago, and were as well
known by us before we abandoned
the theory as untenable, as they are
by Sir John Lubbock or any of his
compeers. They may all, so far as
they bear on religion, be found summed
up and treated at length in
the work of Benjamin Constant, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La
Religion considerée dans sa Source,
ses Developpements, et ses Formes</i>,
published in 1832, as well as in a
mass of German writers. Sir John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
has told us nothing of the mental and
social condition of savages that we
had not examined, we had almost
said, before he was born, and which
we had supposed was not known by
all men with any pretension to serious
studies. In fact, we grow rather
impatient as we grow old of writers
who, because they actually have learned
more than they knew in their cradles,
imagine that they have learned
so much more than all the rest of
mankind. No men try our patience
more than our scientific Englishmen,
who speak always in a decisive tone,
with an air of infallibility from which
there would seem to be no appeal,
and yet utter only the veriest commonplaces,
old theories long since exploded,
or stale absurdities. We have
no patience with such men as Herbert
Spencer, Huxley, and Darwin. We
are hardly less impatient of the scientists
who in our own country hold
them up to our admiration and reverence
as marvellous discoverers, and
as the great and brilliant lights of
the age. We love science, we honor
the men who devote their lives to
its cultivation, but we ask that it <em>be</em>
science, not hypothesis piled on hypothesis,
nor simply a thing of mere
conjectures or guesses.</p>

<p>The modern doctrine of progress
or development, which supposes man
began in the lowest savage, if not
lower still, is not a doctrine suggested
by any facts observed and classified
in men's history, nor is it a logical
induction from any class of
known facts, but a gratuitous hypothesis
invented and asserted against the
Biblical doctrine of creation, of Providence,
of original sin, and of the supernatural
instruction, government,
redemption, and salvation of men.
The hypothesis is suggested by hostility
to the Christian revelation, prior
to the analysis and classification
of any facts to sustain it, and the
scientists who defend it are simply
investigating nature, not in the interests
of science properly so-called,
but, consciously or unconsciously, to
find facts to support a hypothesis
which may be opposed to both.
Any facts in nature or in history,
natural or civil, political or religious,
that seem to make against Christian
teaching, are seized upon
with avidity, distorted or exaggerated,
and paraded with a grand fanfaronade,
sounding of trumpets,
beating of drums, and waving of banners,
as if it were a glorious triumph
of man to prove that he is no better
than the beasts that perish; while the
multitude of facts which are absolutely
irreconcilable with it are passed
over in silence or quietly set aside,
as of no account, or simply declared
to be anomalies, which science is <em>not
yet</em> in a condition to explain, but, no
doubt, soon will be, since it has entered
the true path, has found the
true scientific methods, and is headed
in the right direction. Science is
yet in its infancy. In its cradle it
has strangled frightful monsters, and,
when full-grown, it will not fail to
slay the hydra, and rid the world of
all its "chimeras dire." But while
we do not complain that your infantile
or puerile science has not done
more, we would simply remind you,
men of science, that it is very unscientific
to reason from what you
confess science has not yet done as
if it had done it. Wait till it has
done it, before you bring it forward
as a scientific achievement.</p>

<p>We confess to a want of confidence
in this whole class of scientists, for
their investigations are not free and
unbiassed; their minds are prejudiced;
they are pledged to a theory in
advance, which makes them shut their
eyes to the facts which contradict it,
and close their intelligence to the
great principles of universal reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
which render their conclusions invalid.
There are other scientists who
have pushed their investigations as
far into nature and history as they
have, perhaps even further, who
know and have carefully analyzed
all the facts they know or ever pretended
to know, and yet have come
to conclusions the contrary of theirs,
and find nothing in the facts or phenomena
of the universe that warrant
any induction not in accordance with
Christian faith, either as set forth in
the Holy Scriptures or the definitions
of the church. Why are these less
likely to be really scientific than
they? They are biassed by their
Christian faith, you say. Be it so:
are you less biassed by your anti-christian
unbelief and disposition?
Besides, are you able to say that these
have not in their Christian faith a
key to the real sense or meaning
of the universe and its phenomena
which you have not, and therefore
are much more likely to be right
than you? Do you know that it is
not so? There is no science where
knowledge is wanting.</p>

<p>The unchristian scientists forget
that they cannot conclude against
the Biblical or Christian doctrine
from mere possibilities or even probabilities.
They appeal to science
against it, and nothing can avail
them as the basis of argument against
it that is not scientifically proved or
demonstrated. Their hypothesis of
progress, evolution, or development
is unquestionably repugnant to the
whole Christian doctrine and order
of thought. If it is true, Christianity
is false. They must then, before urging
it, either prove Christianity untrue
or an idle tale, or else prove
absolutely, beyond the possibility of
a rational doubt, the truth of their
hypothesis. It is not enough to prove
that it may, for aught you know, be
true; you must prove that it is true,
and cannot be false. Christianity is
too important a fact in the world's
history to be set aside by an undemonstrated
hypothesis. And it is
anything but scientific to conclude its
falsity on the strength of a simply
possible or even probable hypothesis,
not as yet indeed proved, and of
which the best you can say is that
you trust science will be able to
prove it when once it is out of its
nonage. You cannot propose it at
all, unless you have scientifically demonstrated
it, or previously disproved
<i>aliunde</i> the Christian revelation. So
long as you leave it possible for me
to hold the Christian faith without
contradicting what is demonstrated
to be true, you have alleged nothing
to the purpose against it, and cannot
bring forward your theory even as
probable, far less as scientific; for, if
it is possible that Christianity is true,
it is not possible that your hypothesis
can be true, or even scientifically
proved. The scientists seem not to
be aware of this, and seem to suppose
that they may rank Christianity
with the various heathen superstitions,
and set it aside by an unsupported
theory or a prejudice.</p>

<p>Let the question be understood.
Christianity teaches us that in the
beginning God created heaven and
earth, and all things therein, visible
and invisible, that he made man after
his own image and likeness, placed
him in the garden of Eden, gave
him a law, that is, made him a revelation
of his will, instructed him in
his moral and religious duty, established
him in original justice, in a
supernatural state, under a supernatural
providence, on the plane of a
supernatural destiny; that man prevaricated,
broke the law given him,
lost his original justice, the integrity
of his nature attached thereto, and
communion with his Maker, fell under
the dominion of the flesh, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
captive to Satan, and subject to
death, moral, temporal, and eternal;
that God, of his own goodness and
mercy, promised him pardon and deliverance,
redemption and salvation,
through his own Son made man, who
in due time was born of the Virgin Mary,
suffered under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified, was dead and buried, and
on the third day rose again, ascended
into heaven, whence he shall
come again, to judge the living and
the dead. This doctrine, in substance,
was made to our first parents in the
garden, was preserved in the tradition
of the patriarchs, in its purity
in the synagogue, and in its purity
and integrity in the Christian church
founded on it, and authorized and
assisted by God himself to teach it
to all men and nations.</p>

<p>According to this doctrine, the origin
of man, the human species, as
well as of the universe and all its
contents, is in the creative act of
God, not in evolution or development.
The first man was not a monkey
or a tadpole developed, nor a
savage or barbarian, but was a man
full grown in the integrity of his nature,
instructed by his Maker, and
the most perfect man of his race,
and as he is the progenitor of all
mankind, it follows that mankind
began not in "utter barbarism," as
Sir John asserts, but in the full development
and perfection of manhood,
with the knowledge of God
and Providence, of their origin and
destiny, and of their moral and religious
duty. Ignorance has followed
as the penalty or consequence of sin,
instead of being the original condition
in which man was created;
and this ignorance brought on the
race by the prevarication of Adam,
the domination of the flesh, and the
power of Satan acquired thereby,
are the origin and cause of barbarism
of individuals and nations, the
innumerable moral and social evils
which have afflicted mankind in all
times and places.</p>

<p>Now, to this doctrine Sir John opposes
the hypothesis of the origin of
man in "utter barbarism," and his
progress by natural evolution or self-development.
But what facts has he
adduced in its support, or that conflict
with Christian teaching, that
prove that teaching false or even
doubtful? He has adduced, as far
as we can see, none at all, for all the
facts that he alleges are, to say the
least, as easily explained on the supposition
of man's deterioration as on
the supposition of progress, development,
or continuous melioration. Some
of the facts he adduces <em>might</em>, perhaps,
be explained on his hypothesis, if
there were no reason for giving them
a contrary explanation; but there is
not one of them that must be so explained.
This is not enough for his
purpose, though it is enough for ours.
He must go further, and prove that
his facts not only <em>may</em> but <em>must</em> be
explained on his hypothesis, and can
be explained on no other. If we
are able to explain, or he is unable
to show positively that we
cannot explain, all known facts in accordance
with the Christian doctrine,
he can conclude nothing from them
against Christianity or in favor of
his naturalism. We do not, he must
remember, rely on those facts to
prove the Christian doctrine, but he
relies on them to disprove it, by
proving his hypothesis; and if he cannot
show that they absolutely do
disprove it, or positively prove his
hypothesis, he proves nothing to his
purpose.</p>

<p>Sir John dwells at great length on
the real or supposed rites, forms, and
barbarous customs observed by outlying
savage tribes or nations, but,
before he can draw any conclusion
from them in favor of his theory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
progress, he must prove that they
were primitive. He knows them only
as contemporaneous with what he
would himself call civilized marriage:
how then, without having first proved
that the race began in "utter barbarism,"
conclude from them that they
preceded civilized marriage? One
thing is certain, we never find them
without finding somewhere in the
world contemporary with them the
civilized marriage. There is no history,
historical intimation, or tradition
of any custom or conception of
marriage older than we have in the
Book of Genesis, and in that we find
the true idea of marriage was already
in the world at the earliest date
of history, and the vices against it
are plainly condemned in the Decalogue,
contemporary with these very
usages, customs, and notions of savages
on which Sir John dwells with
so much apparent delight, and which
are barbarous, and lax enough to
satisfy even our women's-rights men;
and, so far as history goes, preceding
them, the true idea of marriage as
something sacred, and as the union
of one man with one woman, was
known and held, and therefore could
not have been, at least so far as
known, a development of barbarian
marriages.</p>

<p>The same answer applies to the question
of religion. Contemporary with
the savage and barbarous superstitions
of the heathen, and even prior to
them, we find practised in its fervor
and purity the true worship of the true
God. True religion is not developed
from the impurities and absurd superstitions
of the heathen, and is by
no means the growth of the religious
sentiment becoming gradually enlightened
and purifying itself from
their grossness, for it is historically as
well as logically older than any of
them. Men worshipped God the creator
of heaven and earth before they
worshipped the fetish, the elements,
or the hosts of heaven. Religion is
older than superstition, for superstition
is an abuse of religion, as the theologians
say, by way of excess, as irreligion
is its abuse by way of defect;
but a thing must exist and be
entertained before it can be abused.
Nothing can be more certain than
that true religion has never been developed
from false religions, or truth
from falsehood; for the true must
precede the false, which is simply the
negation of the true. Christianity is,
if you will, a development, the fulfilment
of the synagogue or the Jewish
religion; Judaism was also, if you
will, a development of the patriarchal
religion; but in neither case a
self-development; and in neither case
has the development been effected
except by supernatural intervention.
It would be absurd to suppose the
patriarchal religion was a development
of heathenism, since it is historically
prior to any form of heathenism,
and every known form of heathenism
supposes it, and is intelligible
only by it. So far was Judaism from
being self-evolved from the superstitions
of the heathen, that it was with
the greatest difficulty that the Israelites
themselves, as their history shows,
were kept from adopting the idolatry
and superstition of the surrounding nations,
which shows that their religion
was not self-evolved, and that it was
above the level of the moral and religious
life of the people. Christianity
develops and perfects Judaism, but
by supernatural agency, not by the
natural progress or self-development
of the Jewish people; for if it had
been, the bulk of the nation would
have accepted it, and we know that
the bulk of the Jewish people did not
accept it, but rejected it, and continue
to reject it to this day.</p>

<p>We know, also, that the progress
of the heathen nations was very far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
from raising them to the level of the
Christian religion. Traces of some of
its principles and several of its moral
precepts may be found with the Gentile
philosophers, as we should expect,
since they pertained to the primitive
revelation; but these philosophers
were not the first, but rather the last
to accept it. Nowhere amongst the
heathen did any Christian communities
spring up spontaneously or were
of indigenous origin. Christianity
sprang out of Judea, and the nations
adopted it, in the first instance, only as
it was carried to them by Jewish missionaries.
And who were these missionaries?
Humble fishermen, publicans,
and mechanics. Who first received
them, and believed their message?
Principally the common people,
the unlettered, the poor, and
slaves of the rich and noble. "For
see your vocation, brethren," says
St. Paul (1 Cor. iv. 26), "that not
many are wise according to the flesh,
not many mighty, not many noble."
Were the fishermen of the Lake Genesareth,
and the slaves of the Roman
Empire, we may ask with Mgr.
Maret, "the most enlightened and
advanced portion of mankind"?
Who dare maintain it, when it is a
question of natural development or
progress? Had Christianity been
the natural evolution of the human
mind, or the product of the natural
growth of human intelligence and
morality, we should have first encountered
it not with the poor, the
ignorant, the unlettered and wretched
slaves, but with the higher and
more cultivated classes, with the philosophers,
the scientists, the noble, the
great generals and the most eminent
orators and statesmen, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</i> of
Greek and Roman society, those who
at the time stood at the head of the
civilized world. Yet such is not the
fact, but the fact is the very reverse.</p>

<p>The Biblical history explains the
origin of the barbarous superstitions
of heathendom in a very satisfactory
way, and shows us very clearly that
the savage state is not the primitive
state, but has been produced by sin,
and is the result of what we call the
great Gentile apostasy, or falling
away of the nations from the primitive
or patriarchal religion. When
language was confounded at Babel,
and the dispersion of mankind took
place, unity of speech or language
was lost, and with it unity of ideas
or of faith, and each tribe or nation
took its own course, and developed
a tribal or national religion of its own.
Gradually each tribe or nation lost
the conception of God as creator,
and formed to itself gods made in
its own image, clothed with its
own passions, and it bowed down
and worshipped the work of its own
hands. It was not that they knew
or had known no better. St. Paul
has settled that question. "For the
wrath of God is revealed from heaven
against all impiety and injustice
of those men that detain the truth
of God in injustice. Because that
which is known of God is manifest
in them. For God hath manifested it
to them. For the invisible things
of him, from the creation of the
world, are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made:
his eternal power also and divinity;
so that they are <em>inexcusable</em>. Because
when they had known God,
they glorified him not as God, nor
gave thanks; but became vain in their
thoughts, and their foolish heart was
darkened; for, professing themselves
wise, they became fools. And they
changed the glory of the incorruptible
God into the likeness of the
image of a corruptible man, and of
birds, and of four-footed beasts, and
of creeping things. Wherefore God
gave them up to the desires of their
hearts, to uncleanness; to dishonor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
their own bodies among themselves,
who changed the truth of God into a
lie, and worshipped and served the
creature rather than the Creator,
who is blessed for ever. Amen."
(Rom. i. 18-25.)</p>

<p>St. Paul evidently does not believe
Sir John Lubbock's doctrine that the
race began in "utter barbarism,"
and have been slowly working their
way up to the heights of Christian
civilization. He evidently ascribes
the superstitions, and consequently
the barbarism, of the heathen to apostasy.
Sir John, of course, does not
accept the authority of St. Paul;
but, if he cannot prove St. Paul
was wrong, he is debarred from asserting
his own hypothesis, even as
probable. If it is possible to explain
the facts of the savage state on the
ground of apostasy or gradual deterioration,
the hypothesis of development,
of self-evolution or natural
and unaided progress, falls to the
ground as wholly baseless. His hypothesis
becomes probable only by
proving that no other hypothesis is
possible.</p>

<p>But all the known facts in the case
are against our scientific baronet's
hypothesis. Take Mohammedanism.
It sprang up subsequently to both
Moses and the Gospel. It is a compound
of Judaism and Christianity,
more Jewish than Christian, however,
and is decidedly inferior to
either. How explain this fact, if the
several races of men never fall or retrograde,
but are always advancing,
marching through the ages onward
and upward? Many of the ancestors
of the present Mussulmans belonged
to highly civilized races,
and some of them were Christians,
and not a few of them Jews. Yet
there is always progress, never deterioration.</p>

<p>But we need not go back to the
seventh century. There has been a
modern apostasy, and we see right
before our eyes the process of deterioration,
of falling into barbarism,
going on among those who have
apostatized from Christianity. The
author regards as an evidence of the
lowest barbarism what he calls "communal
marriage," that is, marriage
in which the wife is common to all
the males of her husband's family.
We do not believe this sort of marriage
was ever anything more than
an exceptional fact, like polyandry;
but suppose it was even common
among the lowest savage tribes, how
much lower or more barbarous is the
state it indicates, than what the
highly civilized Plato makes the magistrates
prescribe in his imaginary
Republic? How much in advance
of such a practice is the free love
advocated by Mary Wolstonecraft and
Fanny Wright; the recommendation
of Godwin to abolish marriage and
the monopoly by one man of any
one woman; than the denunciation
of marriage by the late Robert Owen
as one of the trinity of evils which
have hitherto afflicted the race, and
his proposal to replace it by a community
of wives, as he proposed to
replace private property by a community
of goods; or, indeed, than we
see actually adopted in practice by
the Oneida Community? Sir John
regards the gynocracy which prevails
in some savage tribes as characteristic
of a very low form of barbarism;
but to what else tends the woman's-rights
movement in his country and
ours? If successful, not only would
women be the rulers, but children
would follow the mother's line, not
the father's, for the obvious reason
that, while the mother can be known,
the father cannot be with any certainty.
Does not free love, the mainspring
of the movement, lead to
this? And are not they who support
it counted the advanced party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
of the age, and we who resist denounced
as old fogies or as the defenders
of man's tyranny?</p>

<p>Sir John relates that some tribes
are so low in their intelligence that
they have no or only the vaguest
conceptions of the divinity, and none
at all of God as creator. He need
not go amongst outlying barbarians
to find persons whose intelligence is
equally low. He will search in vain
through all Gentile philosophy without
finding the conception of a creative
God. Nay, among our own contemporaries
he can find more who
consider it a proof of their superior
intelligence and rare scientific attainments
that they reject the fact of
creation, relegate God into the unknown
and the unknowable, and
teach us that the universe is self-evolved,
and man is only a monkey
or gorilla developed.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> These men
regard themselves as the lights of
their age, and are so regarded, too, by
no inconsiderable portion of the public.
Need we name Auguste Comte
and Sir William Hamilton, among
the dead; E. Littré, Herbert Spencer,
J. Stuart Mill, Professor Huxley,
Charles Darwin, not to say Sir John
himself, among the living? If these
men and their adherents have not
lapsed into barbarism, their science,
if accepted, would lead us to the
ideas and practices which Sir John
tells us belong to the lowest stage of
barbarism. Sir John doubts if any
savage tribe can be found that is absolutely
destitute of all religious conceptions
or sentiments, but, if we
may believe their own statements,
we have people enough among the
apostate Christians of our day who
have none, and glory in it as a proof
of their superiority to the rest of
mankind.</p>

<p>Sir John sees a characteristic of
barbarism or of the early savage state
in the belief in and the dread of evil
spirits, or what he calls demonism.
The Bible tells us all the gods of the
heathens are devils or demons. Even
this characteristic of barbarism is reproduced
in our civilized communities
by spiritism, which is of enlightened
American origin. This spiritism,
which is rapidly becoming a religion
with large numbers of men
and women in our midst, is nothing
but demonism, the necromancy and
witchcraft or familiar spirits of the
ancient world. Men who reject
Christianity, who have no belief in
God, or at least do not hold it necessary
to worship or pay him the
least homage or respect, believe in
the spirits, go to the medium, and
consult her, as Saul in his desperation
consulted the Witch of Endor. If
we go back a few years to the last
century, we shall find the most polished
people on the globe abolishing
religion, decreeing that death is an
eternal sleep, and perpetrating, in the
name of liberty, virtue, humanity,
and brotherly love, crimes and cruelties
unsurpassed if not unequalled in
the history of the most savage tribes;
and we see little improvement in our
own century, more thoroughly filled
with the horrors of unprincipled and
needless wars than any other century
of which we possess the history. Indeed,
the scenes of 1792-3-4 are now
in process of reproduction in Europe.</p>

<p>We must remember that all these
deteriorations have taken place in or
are taking place in the most highly
civilized nations of the globe, whose
ancestors were Christians, and with
persons many of whom were brought
up in the belief of Christianity. Take
the men and women who hold, on
marriage and on religion, what are
called "advanced views"&mdash;free-lovers
and free-religionists&mdash;remove them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
from the restraints of the church and
of the state, not yet up to their standard,
and let them form a community
by themselves in which their views
shall be carried out in practice; would
they not in two or three generations
lapse into a state not above that of
the most degraded and filthy savages?
We see this deterioration going
on in our midst and right before our
eyes, as the effect of apostasy from
our holy religion. This proves that
apostasy is sufficient to explain the
existence of the savage races, without
supposing the human race began
in "utter barbarism." If apostasy
in modern times, as we see it does,
leads to "utter barbarism," why
should it not have done so in ancient
times?</p>

<p>We might make the case still
stronger against the author's hypothesis,
if necessary, by referring to
the great and renowned nations of
antiquity, that in turn led the civilization
of the world. Of the nations
that apostatized or adhered to the
great Gentile apostasy, not one has
survived the lapse of time. To every
one of them has succeeded barbarism,
desolation, or a new people.
The Egypt of antiquity fell before
the Persian conqueror, and the Egypt
of the Greeks was absorbed by Rome,
and fell with her. Assyria leaves of
her greatness only long since buried
and forgotten ruins, while the savage
Kurd and the predatory Arab roam
at will over the desert that has succeeded
to her once flourishing cities
and richly cultivated fields. Syria,
Tyre, Carthage, and the Greek cities
of Europe and Asia have disappeared
or dwindled into insignificance,
and what remains of them they owe
to the conservative power of the
Christianity they adopted and have
in some measure retained. So true
is it, as the Psalmist says, "the wicked
shall be turned into hell, and all
the nations that forget God." How
explain this fact, if these ancient nations
could by their own inherent energy
and power of self-development
raise themselves from "utter barbarism"
to the civilization they once
possessed, that they could not preserve
it; that, after having reached a
certain point, they began to decline,
grew corrupt, and at length fell by
their own internal rottenness? If
men and nations are naturally progressive,
how happens it that we find
so many individuals and nations decline
and fall, through internal corruption?</p>

<p>Another fact is not less conclusive
against Sir John's hypothesis, that in
all the nations of the heathen world
their least barbarous period known
to us is their earliest after the apostasy
and dispersion. The oldest of
the sacred books of the Hindus
are the profoundest and richest in
thought, and the freest from superstition
and puerilities so characteristic
of the Hindu people to-day. The
earliest religion of the Romans was
far more spiritual, intellectual, than
that which prevailed at the establishment
of the empire and the introduction
of Christianity. Indeed,
wherever we have the means of tracing
the religious history of the ancient
heathen nations, we find it is a
history of almost uninterrupted deterioration
and corruption, becoming
continually more cruel, impure, and
debasing as time flows on. The
mysteries, perhaps, retained something
of the earlier doctrines, but
they did little to arrest the downward
tendency of the national religion;
the philosophers, no doubt, retained
some valuable traditions of the primitive
religion, but so mixed up with
gross error and absurd fables that
they had no effect on the life or morals
of the people. One of the last
acts of Socrates was to require Crito<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
to sacrifice a cock to Esculapius.
If Sir John's hypothesis were true,
nothing of this could happen, and
we should find the religion of every
nation, as time goes on, becoming
purer and more refined, less gross
and puerile, more enlightened and
intellectual, and more spiritual and
elevating in its influence.</p>

<p>The traditions of some, perhaps of
all heathen nations, refer their origin
to savage and barbarian ancestors,
and this may have been the fact with
many of them. Horace would seem
to go the full length of Sir John's
theory. He tells us that the primitive
men sprang like animals from
the earth, a mute and filthy herd,
fighting one another for an acorn or
a den. Cicero speaks somewhat to
the same purpose, only he does not
say it was the state of the <i>primeval</i>
man. Yet the traditions of the heathen
nations do not in general favor
the main point of Sir John's hypothesis,
that men came out of barbarism
by their own spontaneous development,
natural progressiveness, or
indigenous and unaided efforts. They
rise, according to these traditions, to
the civilized state only by the assistance
of the gods, or by the aid of
missionaries or colonies from nations
already civilized. The goddess Ceres
teaches them to plant corn and make
bread; Bacchus teaches them to plant
the vine and to make wine; Prometheus
draws fire from heaven and
teaches them its use; other divinities
teach to keep bees, to tame and
rear flocks and herds, and the several
arts of peace and war. Athens attributed
her civilization to Minerva
and to Cecrops and his Egyptian colony;
Thebes, hers to Orpheus and
Cadmus, of Phœnician origin; Rome
claimed to descend from a Trojan
colony, and borrowed her laws from
the Athenians&mdash;her literature, philosophy,
her art and science, from the
Greeks. The poets paint the primitive
age as the age of gold, and the
philosophers always speak of the
race as deteriorating, and find the
past superior to the present. What is
best and truest in Plato he ascribes
to the wisdom of the ancients, and
even Homer speaks of the degeneracy
of men in his days from what
they were at the siege of Troy. We
think the author will search in vain
through all antiquity to find a tradition
or a hint which assigns the civilization
of any people to its own indigenous
and unassisted efforts.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock describes the
savages as incurious and little given
to reflection. He says they never
look beyond the phenomenon to its
cause. They see the world in which
they are placed, and never think of
looking further, and asking who made
it, or whence they themselves came
or whither they go. They lack not
only curiosity, but the power of abstraction
and generalization, and even
thought is a burden to them. This
is no doubt in the main true; but it
makes against their natural progressiveness,
and explains why they are
not, as we know they are not, progressive,
but remain always stationary,
if left to themselves. The chief
characteristic of the savage state is
in fact its immobility. The savage
gyrates from age to age in the same
narrow circle&mdash;never of himself advances
beyond it. Whether a tribe
sunk in what Sir John calls "utter
barbarism," and which he holds was
the original state of the human race,
has ever been or ever can be elevated
to a civilized state by any human
efforts, even of others already civilized,
is, perhaps, problematical. As
far as experience goes, the tendency
of such a tribe, brought in contact
with a civilized race, is to retire the
deeper into the forest, to waste away,
and finally to become extinct. Certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
it is, no instance of its becoming
a civilized people can be named.</p>

<p>In every known instance in which
a savage or barbarous people has become
civilized, it has been by the aid
or influence of religion, or their relations
with a people already civilized.
The barbarians that overthrew the
Roman Empire of the West, and
seated themselves on its ruins, were
more than half Romanized before
the conquest by their relations with
the Romans and service in the armies
of the empire, and they rather
continued the Roman order of civilization
in the several kingdoms and
states they founded than destroyed
it. The Roman system of education,
and even the imperial schools, if fewer
in number and on a reduced scale,
were continued all through the barbarous
ages down to the founding of
the universities of mediæval Europe.
Their civilization was carried forward,
far in advance of that of Greece or
Rome, by the church, the great civilizer
of the nations. The northern barbarians
that remained at home, the Germans,
the Scandinavians, the Sclaves,
were civilized by the labors of Christian
monks and missionaries from
Rome and Constantinople, from Gaul,
England, and Ireland. In no instance
has their civilization been of
indigenous origin and development.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock replies to this
as he does to Archbishop Whately's
assertion that no instance is on record
of a savage people having risen
to a civilized state by its own indigenous
and unassisted efforts, that it
is no objection, because we should
not expect to find any record of any
such an event, since it took place, if
at all, before the invention of letters,
and in "prehistoric times." We grant
that the fact that there is no <em>written</em>
record of it is not conclusive proof
that no instance of the kind ever occurred;
but if so important an event
ever occurred, we should expect some
trace of it in the traditions of civilized
nations, or at least find some tendencies
to it in the outlying savage
nations of the present, from which
it might be inferred as a thing not
improbable in itself. But nothing of
the sort is found. The author's appeal
to our ignorance, and our ignorance,
cannot serve his purpose. He
arraigns the universal faith of Christendom,
and he must make out his
case by positive, not simply negative
proofs. Till his hypothesis is proved
by positive evidence, the faith of
Christendom remains firm, and nothing
can be concluded against it.</p>

<p>But how really stands the question?
Sir John finds in the various
outlying savage tribes numerous facts
which he takes to be the original
germs of civilization, and hence he
concludes that the primitive condition
of the human race was that of
"utter barbarism," and the nations,
or, as he says, the races, that have
become civilized, "have become so
by their indigenous and unaided efforts,
by their own inherent energy
and power of self-development or
progress." But the facts he alleges
may just as well be reminiscences
of a past civilization as anticipations
of a civilization not yet developed;
and in our judgment&mdash;and
it is not to-day that for the first we
have studied the question&mdash;they are
much better explained as reminiscences
than as anticipations, nay, are
not explicable in any other way.
The facts appealed to, then, can at
best count for nothing in favor of
the hypothesis of natural progress
or development. They do not prove
it or render it probable.</p>

<p>He is able, and he confesses it, to
produce no instance of the natural
and unassisted progress of any race
of men from barbarism to civilization,
and even his own facts show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
that barbarous or savage tribes
are not naturally progressive, but
stationary, struck with immobility.
Where, then, are the proofs of his hypothesis?
He has yet produced
none. Now, on the other hand, we
have shown him that, in all known
instances, the passage from barbarism
into civilization has been effected
only by supernatural aid, or
by the influence of a previously civilized
race or people. We have shown
him also that the Gentile apostasy,
which the Bible records and our religion
asserts, sufficiently explains the
origin of barbarism. We have also
shown him nations once civilized falling
into barbarism, and, in addition,
have shown him the tendency of an
apostate people to lapse into barbarism
existing and operating before our
very eyes, in men whose ancestors
were once civilized and even Christians.
The chief elements of barbarism
he describes exist and are encouraged
and defended in our midst by
men who are counted by themselves
and their contemporaries as the great
men, the great lights, the advanced
party of this advanced age. Let the
apostasy become more general, take
away the church or deprive her of
her influence, and eliminate from the
laws, manners, and customs of modern
states what they retain of Christian
doctrine and morality, and it is
plain to see that nations the loudest
in their boast of their civilization
would, if not supernaturally arrested
in a very short space of time, sink to
the level of any of the ancient or
modern outlying savage tribes.</p>

<p>Such is the case, and so stands the
argument. Sir John Lubbock brings
forward a hypothesis, not original
with him indeed, and the full bearing
of which we would fain believe he
does not see, for which he adduces
and can adduce not a single well-authenticated
fact, and which would
not be favored for a moment by any
one who understands it, were it not
for its contradiction of the Biblical
doctrine and Christian tradition. But
while there is absolutely no proof of
the hypothesis, all the known facts
of history or of human nature, as well
as all the principles of religion and
philosophy, with one voice pronounce
against it as untenable. Is
not this enough? Nothing is more
certain than Christian faith; no fact
is or can be better authenticated than
the fact of revelation; we might
then allege that the hypothesis is disproved,
nay, not to be entertained,
because it is contrary to the Christian
revelation, than which nothing
can be more certain. We should
have been perfectly justified in doing
so, and so we should have done; but
as the author appeals to science and
progress to support himself on facts,
we have thought it best, without prejudice
to the authority of faith, to
meet him on his own ground, to
show him that science does not entertain
his appeal, and that his
theory of progress is but a baseless
hypothesis, contradicted by all the
known facts in the case and supported
by none; and therefore no science
at all.</p>

<p>Sir John's theory of progress is just
now popular, and is put forth with
great confidence in the respectable
name of science, and the modern
world, with sciolists, accept it, with
great pomp and parade. Yet it is
manifestly absurd. Nothing cannot
make itself something, nor can anything
make itself more than it is.
The imperfect cannot of itself perfect
itself, and no man can lift himself by his
own waistbands. Even Archimedes
required somewhere to stand outside
of the world in order to be able to
raise the world with his lever. Yet
we deny not progress; we believe in
it, and hold that man is progressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
even to the infinite; but not by
his own unaided effort or by his
own inherent energy and natural
strength, nor without the supernatural
aid of divine grace. But progress
by nature alone, or self-evolution,
though we tried to believe it when
a child, we put away when we became
a man, as we did other childish
things.</p>

<p>Thus much we have thought it our
duty to say in reply to the theory
that makes the human race begin
in utter barbarism, and civilization
spring from natural development or
evolution, so popular with our unchristian
scientists or&mdash;but for respect
to the public we would say&mdash;sciolists.
We have in our reply repeated
may things which we have said before
in this magazine, and which
have been said by others, and better
said. But it will not do to let such
a book as the one before us go unanswered
in the present state of the
public mind, debauched as it is by
false science. If books will repeat the
error, we can only repeat our answer.</p>

<h2>PAU.</h2>


<p>American tourists make a great
mistake in not generally including
the Pyrenees in their route of European
travel. Unless ordered there by
a physician to repair a wasted or broken-down
constitution, they scarcely
think of visiting the most beautiful
country perhaps in the world.
Paris is France, and, as the route from
Paris to Spain lies direct, they pass
through the Pyrenees, admire them
casually, but rarely pause to examine
their beauties and the curiosities of
the quaint old towns embedded in
their hills. Since chances of this
nature alone led me to discover what
since has remained in my memory an
exquisite picture to be revivified at
any moment, I cannot blame others
for following the usual guide-book
routes of Europe, and spending their
money freely on places far less worthy
their attention. After a severe typhoid
fever of ten weeks in Paris,
and still so feeble that I had to be
almost carried to the depot, I set out
on the 5th of January, 1869, accompanied
by my nurse, to make the
journey to the Pyrenees, if possible,
in a day and a half. We left Paris
at 10.45 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, by the Chemin de
Fer d'Orléans. Resting for a few
minutes at the historical old towns
of Orléans, Tours, Poitiers, Angoulême,
and Livourne, we arrived at
Bordeaux at eleven <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, where we
remained for the night. The next
morning at eight we pursued our
journey, passing Dax, so celebrated
for its warm mud-baths, said to be a
remedy for rheumatic complaints, and
a little after one <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> I found my
friends awaiting me at Pau. Entering
one of the queer little half-omnibuses
that hold six people and their
luggage, I was carried through the
oddest of small white streets to my
lodging in the Jurançon, near the villa
of my friend.</p>

<p>Never shall I forget my impressions
while entering the room prepared
for me, and leaning on the arm
of the dear girl who with her mother
and sister had done everything for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
my comfort. It was the Epiphany,
the day of light; and it seemed as if
the soft sunlight that shone in that
pretty room and rested on the fragrant
flowers was to me the foreshadowing
of a renewed life and happy future.
The air was balmy as a June day,
and from my window rose the glorious
Pyrenees. Covered with their
everlasting mantles of snow, they
rose proudly to heaven, as if they
defied the clouds above them. A
second lower range, with its varied
shades of green and the tropical
luxuriance at its base, completed the
picture. Exhausted with my journey,
my eyes filled with tears of joy at all
my sweet surroundings, I could have
begged my God there and then to let
me sleep for ever.</p>

<p>Day after day I walked my few
steps in my balcony and took in this
lovely picture. As yet I had not
seen the town; my strength was insufficient,
and I simply rested and
recuperated. The climate seemed to
me a strange one for invalids&mdash;a
queer mixture, as I thought it, of
flannels and sun-umbrellas. The
mornings and evenings were cold and
chilly with the air that blew down
from the mountains, and the middle
of the day, from eleven until three
o'clock, so intensely hot that it was
necessary to be well protected against
sun-stroke. Still, it is the great resort
of consumptives, and at almost every
turn one encounters the muffled-up
pale countenance of the poor invalid.
But for this one sad feature, the exquisite
scenery, the tropical foliage,
the picturesque villas, and the town
itself, of white limestone, rising around
its great chateau to the very heavens,
with the merry hum of voices, that
greets you on every side, might well
make you imagine you had at last
found the fairy dreamland&mdash;a country
that realized the fairy ideal of childhood.</p>

<p>This, too, is the land of the troubadour,
and the quaint wild music
chanted by the peasantry has a something
about it irresistibly attractive,
something one hears nowhere else;
now dreamy, now bright, almost
monotonous at times, then suddenly
bursting into strains of sadness in
which the whole depths of a life are
portrayed. Then there is the ringing
mountaineer song, too, with its clear
and measured cadence, and a certain
bravery in its tones which could easily
foretell the difficult mastering of such
a people, should it ever again be required.</p>

<p>The mixture of Spanish merchants
and wanderers among the population
gives to their parks and squares a
pretty effect. They cross the Pyrenees
with their showy wares, their
strings of perfumed beads, bracelets,
necklaces, rosaries, all made of the
wood that grows at the foot of their
mountains. Dressed in their own
picturesque costumes, and carrying
their merchandise of every imaginable
color&mdash;red and bright yellow predominating&mdash;they
accost you with a
grace which renders them irresistible,
and you find yourself rather poorer
for the encounter.</p>

<p>I improved so rapidly in this climate,
getting wholly rid of my cough
and gaining twenty-five pounds in
little over four weeks, that I concluded
I was well enough to return to
Paris, and thence, after another rest
in England, home. I resolved, therefore,
to see all that Pau offered to the
sight-seer.</p>

<p>I drove with my kind friends several
times to and around the varied
and pretty villas: the primroses peeped
at us from under the hedges, and
here and there the rarest tropical
trees and plants riveted our attention&mdash;and
this in February, when the
most of the world was ice-bound.
The snow-capped mountains, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
rising around us on every side,
would not permit us to entirely forget
winter. The town itself, of twenty-one
thousand inhabitants, is almost
a miniature Paris, some squares duplicating
those of the great city, and
the bridges separating Pau and the
Jurançon, though crossing a much
prettier river than the Seine, heightening
the resemblance.</p>

<p>The churches are costly and beautiful;
one built by the Society of Jesus,
entirely of white marble, and
lined with exquisite pictures and
gifts of the wealthy strangers who
pass the season at the different hotels,
is a perfect gem in its way.</p>

<p>The hotels, the Place Royale with
its music every Thursday&mdash;weather
permitting, as say our friends of the
Central Park&mdash;where crowds walk
up and down and listen to but little,
I imagine, are all attractions for the
health or pleasure seeker.</p>

<p>Very odd old houses with gabled
roofs, and reminding you of Dutch
pictures, start out occasionally from
among the more modern and fashionable
ones, and seem to tell the
story of change and decay.</p>

<p>Not unfrequently a merry peasant
wedding party, in a whole line of
carriages trumpeting vigorously and
raising the dust, pass you with shouts,
and compel your curiosity to recognize
and salute the bride. It is said
the strangers with their wealth and
fashionable follies are gradually obliterating
these good old Béarnais
customs, through the spirit of emulation
they excite in a hitherto perfectly
happy peasantry. Women, however,
still walk the streets with their distaffs,
and men knit as they guide the
plough. Something of primeval innocence
still remains. Certainly no
country was ever more paradisiacally
formed to retain it.</p>

<p>My time was limited, however; I
could not stay and study these people
and their customs as I would
have wished. I could not visit the
great summer resort, the famed Eaux
Bonnes, so beautifully nestled, they
told me, among the higher Pyrenees,
but must exert all the strength I had
to see before I left the great monument
of Pau, the grand old</p>


<h3>CHATEAU OF HENRY IV.</h3>

<p>The street ascends to it, and through
an arcade by stone steps to its park,
which is now the everyday public
resort. The park extends all around
the chateau, and, crossing a pretty
bridge erected over the Rue Marca,
it continues for some miles in an ornamented
walk containing two principal
avenues; one so shaded that
it is cool all summer, and the other
sunny enough at any time to welcome
and warm the poor invalid
who could not exist without his daily
walk.</p>

<p>We do not find here the rich and
varied architecture so attractive in
other imperial parks, Versailles, for
instance; the hand of man is displaced
by that of nature, but the
woods of rare trees on hills that give
everywhere the exquisite panorama
of the encircling Pyrenees are more
than compensatory for any omissions
of art.</p>

<p>The gate of St. Martin greets you
as you enter. Built in 1586, it was
formerly the main entrance to the
chateau when the drawbridge was
used. Now it leads to the Hôtel de
la Monnaie, a dependence inhabited
by the subalterns and furnishers of
the palace. Here the money of
Béarn was formerly made. Now we
approach a hemicycle containing two
large vases in Medici form of Swedish
porphyry, and given to the chateau
of Pau by King Bernadotte, who
was born here. The statue of Gaston
Phœbus in white marble, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
work of the Baron of Triquety, towers
between them. He stands the
guard perpetual of the chateau.</p>

<p>Much of the land belonging to
the former park has been divided
and sold, and is now the Place Napoléon.
Vestiges, however, of ancient
walls are still allowed to exist,
and on the left may yet be seen the
remains of the Hermitage of Notre
Dame des Bris, attributed to William
Raymond, ravaged during the religious
wars, and entirely destroyed in
1793.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill on the north
side stood also the Castet Beziat (in
Béarnais dialect, <i>dearest castle</i>). And
here let me speak of this odd native
patois. It is a mixture of French,
Spanish, and Italian, and is understood
only by strangers who know
the three languages, yet it is euphonious
and occasionally dignified.
The better class of the peasantry
speak both it and a pretty French.
They prolong the syllables more
than in Paris, which adds greatly to
the sweetness of the sound. This
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Château Chère</i> was built after the
model of the Château de Madrid in
the Bois de Boulogne, by Marguerite
of Valois.</p>

<p>Jeanne d'Albret made it her favorite
residence, and here occupied herself
exclusively with the education
of her children, Henry IV. and Catherine,
who, after the death of her
mother, made it the secret residence
of the Count de Soissons, whom she
passionately loved but could not
marry. No trace of this Castet Beziat
exists now. But let us enter the
great chateau, and first consider
somewhat its origin. Centule le
Bieux was its founder toward the end
of the year 982, and his successors
continued the southern portion, but
it was not finished until the time of
Gaston Phœbus, who completed also
the great square tower that bears his
name, the ramparts and parapets, and
the mill-tower, in order that he might
make it his residence. This mill-tower
gave entrance to the Place de la Basse
Ville, or former field of battle, where
hand to hand the armed knights decided
their judiciary combats. About
1460, Gaston X., desirous to give his
Béarnais people a truly royal residence,
constructed the north and east portions
of the edifice, laid out the park,
and decided that the states of Béarn
should be always represented in the
halls of the castle.</p>

<p>In 1527, the Margaret of Margarets,
the sister so dear to Francis I.,
becoming queen of Navarre by her
marriage with Henry II., made it
a true palace of the Renaissance, restoring
it entirely and refurnishing
it from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Abandoned later by Henry IV.,
become king of France, and despoiled
of everything precious it possessed
by him and Louis XIII., entirely
neglected by their successors, it fell
into the hands of governors, then
was seized by the republicans, who,
not contented to sell at the lowest
price and piece by piece the lands
of the royal domain, converted into
a tavern and stables the palace that
formerly was the cradle of the great
king.</p>

<p>Not until the short reign of Louis
XVIII. was any attempt made to restore
the castle to its former condition,
a work soon neglected and
abandoned, but recommenced in
1838 by Louis Philippe, who ordered
besides the complete refurnishing of
the apartments pretty much as they
are seen to-day.</p>

<p>Napoleon III., however, with his
taste for the restoration of all fallen
grandeur that may recall royalty or
the Empire, has done all in his power
to produce an almost magic transformation,
a complete resurrection of the
old chateau, and at the present time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
the work continues under the supervision
of the most able architects.</p>

<p>The beautiful exterior that presents
itself so commandingly, the harmony
that prevails in every part of the
building surrounding the Court of
Honor, the pretty windows opening
on the chapel, the sculptures everywhere
newly restored, the incessant
labor on the southern portion, all denote
the desire of Napoleon to preserve
and embellish one of the most
precious monuments of history.</p>

<p>The letters <big><b>G-P</b></big> in gold are
placed in different parts of the building.
To Gaston Phœbus is accorded
the honor of its construction.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/g-p.png" width="80" height="32" alt="" />
</div>

<p>You enter the chateau from the
town-side by a bridge of stone and
brick, built by Louis XV. to replace
the drawbridge that formerly occupied
the site of the present chapel.</p>

<p>Pause on this bridge, and look
around you. On either side is a
deep ditch which once defended the
entrance of the chateau, now a magnificent
avenue planted with trees
and covered with flower-beds. At
your left is the chapel, whose date is
1840. The doors and windows are
elaborately sculptured. In front, you
will notice three arcades constructed
in the style of the Renaissance, covered
with a terrace and carved balustrade,
which serves for the principal
entrance.</p>

<p>On your left and under the portico
is the porter's lodge. At the right in
the new building are the bureaus of
administration and service; on the
first story, the apartments of the military
commander; on the second,
those of the register; and on the
third and last, the housekeeper's
rooms for linen, etc.</p>

<p>The Court of Honor arrests your
attention by its original form, its
deeply graven sculptures in the niches
of the windows and doors representing
the different Béarnais sovereigns,
and the statue of Mars that
faces the principal entrance. If these
walls could speak, they would tell
how often the Béarnais people have
assembled here with shouts of respect
or cries of vengeance, according as
the qualities of their prince called
forth the one or the other.</p>

<p>The towers of the chateau are six
in number: at the left on entering,
the Tower Gaston Phébus; at the
right, the new Tower and Tower
Montauzet; at the lower end, the
northwest, the Tower Billères; and
at the southwestern end, the two
Towers Mazères.</p>

<p>The tower Gaston Phébus, or donjon,
was called the tile tower, because
it is built almost entirely of brick.
It has a roof of slate which was carried
off in a terrible storm in 1820.</p>

<p>A balcony faces the church of St.
Martin, where the president of the
states of Béarn took his place to
proclaim the name of each newly
elected sovereign.</p>

<p>Several illustrious personages have
inhabited this tower. Among others,
Clement Marot, the favorite and unfortunate
adorer of the Queen Margaret,
and Mademoiselle de Scudery,
who passed the summer here of 1637.</p>

<p>Under the reign of Louis XIV. it
was converted into a prison of state,
and so continued until 1822.</p>

<p>Each story is now inhabited and
richly furnished, and on the fifth is a
terrace that commands a most imposing
view of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>The tower Montauzet, in the Béarnais
dialect, takes its name from the
circumstance that only birds could
reach the top; Montauzet meaning
Mount Bird! In truth, it has no
staircase, and history tells us that in
case of a siege the garrison ascended
it by ladders, which they drew up
after them.</p>

<p>It had its dungeons, terrible wells<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
into which criminals were lowered.
An iron statue armed with steel
poniards received them, clasped
them in its arms, and, by ingenious
means that the legend does not explain,
murdered them in unspeakable
tortures. Henri d'Albret closed up
the entrance to these dungeons, and
they were forgotten until the reign of
Louis XV. He caused them to be
opened, and discovered skeletons and
iron chains fastened to the walls.</p>

<p>The ground-floor of the tower
Montauzet formerly contained a fine
fountain. This will be replaced. The
three stories above are occupied generally
by the domestics of the great
dignitaries of the crown.</p>

<p>The other towers have nothing of
interest. They are named from the
villages they face, and are simply
advanced sentinels to defend the approach
of an enemy from the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>As soon as a visitor arrives at the
chateau, he is ushered into the waiting-room
called Salle des Gardes, because
during the presence of majesty
the valets waited here under the supervision
of an officer of the household.
But little furniture is seen, a
few old-fashioned chairs surmounted
by lions and the arms of France and
Navarre.</p>

<p>From this room we enter the dining-room
of the officers of the service.
There is nothing remarkable
in its furniture, a long and very wide
table occupying the centre, and comfortable
chairs placed against the
wall. Two statues, the one of Henry
IV., the other of Tully, stand on
either side of the door, and are singularly
imposing.</p>

<p>We pass on to the dining-room of
their majesties. This is far more elegant.
Flemish tapestry adorns the
walls, which was brought here from
the Château de Madrid in the Bois
de Boulogne. It represents the chase
in the different months of June, September,
November, and December.
A clock of the time and style of
Louis XIV., and a statue of Henry
IV. in white marble, by Francheville,
which is said to be older, and to represent
the king more correctly than
any other, are the principal ornaments.</p>

<p>The Staircase of Honor leads us
to the first story. It is richly sculptured
with astonishing beauty and
skill. Doors lead from it to the
kitchens below, and to the different
towers.</p>

<p>We ascend and gain the waiting-room.
During the presence of their
majesties, the door-keepers remain
here. When the emperor is alone,
he chooses this for his slight repasts.</p>

<p>The most beautiful tapestry covers
the walls. The subjects are of all
kinds, mostly rural scenes, in which
children or fairies predominate. The
furniture is of oak, and covered with
leather.</p>

<p>The reception-room, the largest
and most elegant in the chateau,
awaits us next. Here, by order and
under the eyes of the cruel Montgomery,
general of Jeanne d'Albret,
ten Catholic noblemen were treacherously
murdered. The sun shone in
on us through the large bay-windows,
and gilded the richly ornamented
stone chimney, and threw
the reflection of the mountain-tops
across the floor. We stood, perhaps,
on the very spot where these brave
souls had met their death so many
years before, though no trace remained
of the horrors of that day.
The guide told the story, and most
of our party passed on to admire the
tapestry and the costly vases that
lend enchantment to what should be
a chamber of mourning. With all
its beauty, I was glad to escape to
the family apartment.</p>

<p>Here, it is said, Queen Margaret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
presided. Her picture, and those of
Francis I., Henri d'Albret, and
Henry IV., formerly graced the walls,
but the hand of vandalism, in 1793,
spared not even them. They were
burned with all the other pictures of
the chateau. A bronze statue of
Henry IV., when a child, which
graces a pretty bracket, and a table,
the gift of Bernadotte, ornament the
room.</p>

<p>The sleeping apartments of the
emperor and empress follow, furnished
tastefully with Sèvres china
ornaments, on which are representations
of Henry IV., Tully, and the
Château de Pau, beautifully executed.
The walls are hung with
Flemish tapestry; but in the boudoir
of the empress are to be seen
six pieces of Gobelin tapestry, so
finished that it was some time before
it could be decided they were not
oil-paintings. The subjects are:
"Tully at the feet of Henry IV.;"
"Henry IV. at the Miller Michaud's;"
"The Parting of Henry
IV. with Gabrielle;" "The Fainting
of Gabrielle;" "Henry IV. meeting
Tully Wounded;" "Henry IV.
before Paris."</p>

<p>An odd Jerusalem chest, also in
this room, is the admiration of
strangers. It is made of walnut,
inlaid with ivory, and was brought
from Jerusalem, and purchased at
Malta in 1838.</p>

<p>A bath-room of red marble of the
Pyrenees is attached to these apartments,
from which we ascend to the
second story.</p>

<p>Here are large rooms much in the
same style as the others, yet not quite
so elaborate. In 1848, Abd-el-Kadir
and his numerous family occupied
this suite. An interesting model of
the old chateau is here shown, executed
by a poor man named Saget,
who presented it to the Orleans
family at a very low price, hoping,
no doubt, another recompense, which
he never received.</p>

<p>A room whose tapestry is devoted
to Psyche leads us to a chamber
which formed part of the apartment
of Jeanne d'Albret, where it is said
Henry IV. was born, and where his
cradle is still preserved. The bed
that Jeanne d'Albret occupied ordinarily
is in the room adjoining, and
a quainter piece of architecture cannot
be imagined. It is of oak, richly
carved, covered and mounted by a
sleeping warrior and an owl, emblems
of sleep and night. In the
inner portion, towards the wall, is
the Virgin, on one side, holding the
infant Jesus, and an Evangelist on
the other. Very rich cornices, with
lion heads projecting and the framework
of the arms of Béarn, complete
the description. How, without steps,
they ever got into those beds is a
mystery; the upper berth of a steamer
is easy of access in comparison, but
there we have always steps or underberths
that serve the same purpose.</p>

<p>The cradle of Henry IV. is a single
tortoise-shell in its natural state. It
must have been a good-sized tortoise
that gave its back to the honor, but
he must have been a very little baby
to have slept in such a couch. The
cradle hangs very gracefully, supported
by six cords and flags embroidered
in gold, with the arms of
France and Navarre. Above is a
crown of laurel, surmounted by a
white plume of ostrich feathers, and
underneath all a table covered with
a blue velvet cloth.</p>

<p>The chapel and library are the
only remaining objects of interest.
The volumes of the library were presented
by the emperor a short time
ago, and they are well selected.</p>

<p>There were formerly two chapels,
but the older one has been done away
with. The present one was built in
1849, on the site of the old gate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
the drawbridge. The gate is still
preserved, and on it a marble slab
that formerly bore this inscription:</p>


<p class="center"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">HENRICUS DEI GRATIA<br />
CHRISTIANISSIMUS REX FRANCIÆ<br />
NAVARRÆ TERTIUS<br />
DOMINUS SUPREMUS BEARNI</span><br />
1592.</p>


<p>The interior of the chapel has
lately been restored and repainted.
It is not remarkable for anything,
however. The altar-piece is tawdry,
and not in the usual good taste of
the chateau.</p>

<p>We left this again for the beautiful
park, roamed through it once more,
and I took my last look at the imposing
structure I had studied with
so much interest.</p>

<p>I would advise all who visit Europe
to see Pau and the Pyrenees. Those
who do so will certainly say with me
that, had they crossed the ocean for
nothing else, they would have been
more than compensated.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR OF FATHER JOHN DE BRÉBEUF, S.J.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></h2>


<p>Among the foremost and most distinguished
of the Catholic missionaries
of America stands the name of
Father John de Brébeuf, the founder
of the Huron Mission. Normandy
has the honor of giving him birth,
and Canada was the field of his
splendid and heroic labors; yet the
mission of which he was the great
promoter was the prelude to, and
was intimately connected with, subsequent
missions in our own country;
and at the time of his glorious death,
his heaven-directed gaze was eagerly
and zealously turned towards the
country of our own fierce Iroquois,
the inhabitants of Northern New
York, amongst whom he ardently
longed to plant the cross of the
Christian missions. His labors and
those of his companions opened the
northwestern portions of our country,
and the great Valley of the Mississippi,
to Christianity and civilization,
and the discoveries and explorations
which followed were partly the fruits
of his and their exalted ministry and
enlightened enterprise; for, as Bancroft
says, "the history of their
labors is connected with the origin
of every celebrated town in the
annals of French America; not a
cape was turned, not a river entered,
but a Jesuit led the way." His fame
and achievements belong to all
America, indeed, more truly, to all
Christendom. Saint, hero, and martyr
as he was, his merits are a part
of the heritage of the universal
church; and while his relics are
venerated on earth, and even the
enemies of our religion accord to him
the most exalted praise, Catholics
may, with the eye of faith, behold
him in that glorious and noble band
of martyrs in heaven, decked in resplendent
garments of red, dyed in
their own blood, passing and repassing
eternally, in adoration and thanksgiving,
before the throne of him who
was the Prince of Martyrs.</p>

<p>While historians outside of the
Catholic Church have marvelled at
such extraordinary virtues and unparalleled
achievements as have been
displayed, not alone by a Xavier, but
by the missionaries of our own land,
and have extolled them as an honor
to human nature, Catholics may be
excused for regarding them as miracles
of the faith, triumphs of the
church, and martyrs of religion. It
seems strange that the general historians
of the church have bestowed
so little notice upon the planting and
propagation of the faith in America.
The history of these events presents
to our admiration characters the
most noble, deeds the most heroic,
virtues the most saintly, lives the
most admirable, and deaths the most
glorious. While the church of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
America, in our day, counts her
children by millions, what more inspiring
lesson could she place before
their eyes than the history of her
early days, when her priests and
missionaries were confessors and
martyrs? Of these was the subject
of the present memoir.</p>

<p>John de Brébeuf was born in the
diocese of Bayeux, in Normandy,
March 25, 1593, of a noble family,
said to be the same that gave origin
to the illustrious and truly Catholic
house of the English Arundels. He
resolved to dedicate himself to the
service of God in the holy ministry,
and, with this view, entered the novitiate
of the Society of Jesus, at
Rouen, October 5, 1617. Having
completed his noviceship, he entered
upon his theological studies. He received
subdeacon's orders at Lisseux,
and those of deacon at Bayeux, in
September, 1621; was ordained a
priest during the Lent of 1622, and
offered up the holy sacrifice of the
Mass for the first time on Lady-day
of the same year. He was, though
of the youngest, one of the most
zealous and devoted priests of his
order, and, from the time that he
consecrated himself to religion, was
given to daily austerities and rigorous
self-mortifications.</p>

<p>Catching the spirit of his divine
Master, Father Brébeuf conceived an
ardent thirst for the salvation of souls,
and the foreign missions became the
object of his most fervent desire.
This chosen field was soon opened
to his intrepid and heroic labors.
When Father Le Caron, the Recollect
missionary in Canada, asked
for the assistance of the Jesuits
in his arduous undertaking of conquering
to Christ the savage tribes
of North America, Fathers John de
Brébeuf, Charles Lallemant, and Evremond
Massé, themselves all eager
for the task, were selected by their
superiors for the mission. These
apostolic men sailed from Dieppe,
April 26, 1625, and reached Quebec
after a prosperous voyage. The reception
they at first met was enough
to have appalled any hearts less resolute
and inspired from above than
were the hearts of Father Brébeuf
and his companions. The Recollects,
a branch of the Franciscan
Order, who, through Father Le
Caron, had invited them over, had
received at their convent on the
river St. Charles no tidings of their
arrival; Champlain, ever friendly to
the missionaries of the faith, was
absent; Caen, the Calvinist, then at
the head of the fur-trading monopoly
of New France, refused them
shelter in the fort; and the private
traders at Quebec closed their doors
against them. To perish in the wilderness,
or to return to France from
the inhospitable shores of the New
World, was the only alternative
before them. At this juncture the
good Recollects, hearing of their arrival
and destitution, hastened from
their convent in their boat, and received
the outcast sons of Loyola
with every demonstration of joy and
hospitality, and carried them to the
convent. It is unaccountable how
Parkman, in his <cite>Pioneers of France in
the New World</cite>, in the face of these
facts, related by himself in common
with historians generally, should
charge against the Recollects that
they "entertained a lurking jealousy
of these formidable fellow-laborers,"
as he calls the Jesuits; who, on the
contrary, were the chosen companions
of the Recollects, were invited to
share their labors, and with whom
they prosecuted with "one heart and
one mind" the glorious work of the
missions. The sons of St. Francis
and St. Ignatius united at once in
administering to the spiritual necessities
of the French at Quebec, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
the latter, by their heroic labors and
sacrifices, soon overcame the prejudice
of their enemies.</p>

<p>From his transient home at Quebec,
Father Brébeuf watched for an
opportunity of advancing to the field
of his mission among the Indians.
The first opportunity that presented
itself was the proposed descent of
Father Viel to Three Rivers, in order
to make a retreat, and attend to
some necessary business of the mission.
Father Brébeuf, accompanied
by the Recollect Joseph de la Roche
Dallion, lost no time in repairing to
the trading post to meet the father,
return with him and the expected
annual flotilla of trading canoes from
the Huron country, and commence
his coveted work among the Wyandots.
But he arrived only to hear
that Father Viel had gained the
crown of martyrdom, together with a
little Christian boy, whom their Indian
conductor, as his canoe shot
across the last dangerous rapids in
the river Des Prairies, behind Montreal,
seized and threw into the foaming
torrent together, by which they
were swept immediately into the
seething gulf below, never to rise
again. Neither the death of Father
Viel, nor his own ignorance of the
Huron language, appalled the brave
heart of Father Brébeuf, who, when
the flotilla came down, begged to be
taken back as a passenger to the
Huron country; but the refusal of
the Indians to receive him compelled
him to return to Quebec. On the
twentieth of July, 1625, he went
among the Montagnais, with whom he
wintered, and, for five months, suffered
all the rigors of the climate, in
a mere bark-cabin, in which he had
to endure both smoke and filth, the
inevitable penalties of accepting savage
hospitality. Besides this, his encampment
was shifted with the ever-varying
chase, and it was only his
zeal that enabled him, amid incessant
changes and distractions, to
learn much of the Indian language,
for the acquisition of the various dialects
of which, as well as for his aptitude
in accommodating himself to
Indian life and manners, he was singularly
gifted. On the twenty-seventh
of March following, he returned to
Quebec, and resumed, in union with
the Recollects, the care of the French
settlers. The Jesuits and Recollects,
moving together in perfect unison,
went alternately from Quebec to the
Recollect convent and Jesuit residence,
on a small river called St.
Charles, not far from the city.</p>

<p>The colony of the Jesuit fathers
was soon increased by the arrival of
Fathers Noirot and De la Nouë, with
twenty laborers, and they were thus
enabled to build a residence for themselves&mdash;the
mother house and
headquarters of these valiant soldiers
of the cross in their long and
eventful struggle with paganism and
superstition among the Indians. Father
Brébeuf and his companions
now devoted their labors to the
French at Quebec, then numbering
only forty-three, hearing confessions,
preaching, and studying the Indian
languages. They also bestowed considerable
attention on the cultivation
of the soil. But these labors were
but preparatory for others more arduous,
but more attractive to them.</p>

<p>In 1626, the Huron mission was
again attempted by Father Brébeuf.
He, together with Father Joseph de
la Roche Dallion and the Jesuit Anne
de Nouë, was sent to Three Rivers,
to attempt a passage to the Huron
country. When the Indian flotilla
arrived at Three Rivers, the Hurons
were ready to receive Father
de la Roche on board, but being unaccustomed
to the Jesuit habit, and
objecting, or pretending to object, to
the portly frame of Father Brébeuf,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
they refused a passage to him and his
companion, Father Nouë. At last,
some presents secured a place in the
flotilla for the two Jesuits. The missionaries,
after a painful voyage, arrived
at St. Gabriel, or La Rochelle, in
the Huron country, and took up the
mission which the Recollects Le Caron
and Viel had so nobly pioneered.</p>

<p>The Hurons, whose proper name
was Wendat, or Wyandot, were a
powerful tribe, numbering at least
thirty thousand souls, living in eighteen
villages scattered over a small
strip of land on a peninsula in the
southern extremity of the Georgian
Bay. Other tribes, kindred to them,
stretched through New York and into
the continent as far south as the
Carolinas. Their towns were well
built and strongly defended, and they
were good tillers of the soil, active
traders, and brave warriors. They
were, however, behind their neighbors
in their domestic life and in their
styles of dress, which for both sexes
were exceedingly immodest. Their
objects of worship were one supreme
deity, called the Master of Life, to
whom they offered human sacrifices,
and an infinite number of inferior
deities, or rather fiends, inhabiting
rivers, cataracts, or other natural
objects, riding on the storms, or
living in some animal or plant, and
whom they propitiated with tobacco.
Father Brébeuf had acquired sufficient
knowledge of their language to
make himself understood by the natives,
and he was greatly assisted by
the instructions and manuscripts of
Fathers Le Caron and Viel. Father
Nouë, being unable to acquire the
language, by reason of his great age
and defective memory, returned to
Quebec in 1627, and was followed
the next year by Father de la Roche,
who had made a brave but unsuccessful
effort to plant the cross
among the Attiarandaronk, or Neutrals.
The undaunted Brébeuf was
thus in 1629 left alone among the
Hurons. He soon won their confidence
and respect, and was adopted
into the tribe by the name of <i>Echon</i>.
Though few conversions rewarded his
labors among them during his three
years' residence, still he was amply
compensated by his success in gaining
their hearts, acquiring their language,
and thoroughly understanding
their character and manners. So
completely had he gained the good-will
of the Hurons, that, when he was
about to return in 1629 to Quebec,
whither his superior had recalled him,
in consequence of the distress prevailing
in the colony, the Indians
crowded around him to prevent him
from entering the canoes, and addressed
him in this touching language;
"What! Echon, dost thou
leave us? Thou hast been here now
three years, to learn our language,
to teach us to know thy God, to
adore and serve him, having come
but for that end, as thou hast shown;
and now, when thou knowest our
language more perfectly than any
other Frenchman, thou leavest us. If
we do not know the God thou adorest,
we shall call him to witness that it is not
our fault, but thine, to leave us so."
Deeply as he felt this appeal, the Jesuit
could know no other voice when
his superior spoke; and having given
every encouragement to those
who were well disposed toward the
faith, and explained why he should
go when his superior required it, he
embarked on the flotilla of twelve
canoes, and reached Quebec on the
seventeenth of July, 1629. Three
days after his arrival at Quebec, that
port was captured by the English under
the traitor Kirk, who bore the
deepest hatred toward the Jesuits,
whose residence he would have fired
upon could he have brought his vessel
near enough for his cannon to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
bear upon it. He pillaged it, however,
compelling the fathers to abandon
it and fly for safety to Tadoussac.
But Father Brébeuf and his
companions were, together with
Champlain, detained as prisoners.
Amongst the followers of Kirk was
one Michel, a bitter and relentless
Huguenot, who was by his temperament
and infirmities prone to violence,
and who vented his rage especially
against the Jesuits. He and
the no less bigoted Kirk found in Father
Brébeuf an intrepid defender
of his order and of his companions
against their foul calumnies, while at
the same time his noble character
showed how well it was trained to
the practice of Christian humility and
charity.</p>

<p>On the occasion here particularly
alluded to, Kirk was conversing with
the fathers, who were then his prisoners,
and, with a malignant expression,
said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, your business in Canada
was to enjoy what belonged
to M. de Caen, whom you dispossessed."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, sir," answered Father
Brébeuf, "we came purely for
the glory of God, and exposed ourselves
to every kind of danger to
convert the Indians."</p>

<p>Here Michel broke in: "Ay, ay,
convert the Indians! You mean,
convert the <i>beaver</i>!"</p>

<p>Father Brébeuf, conscious of his
own and his companion's innocence,
and deeming the occasion one which
required at his hands a full and unqualified
denial, solemnly and deliberately
answered:</p>

<p>"That is false!"</p>

<p>The infuriated Michel, raising his
fist at his prisoner in a threatening
manner, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"But for the respect I owe the
general, I would strike you for giving
me the lie."</p>

<p>Father Brébeuf, who possessed a
powerful frame and commanding figure,
stood unmoved and unruffled.
But he did not rely upon these qualities
of the man, though he knew no
fear, but illustrated by his example
on this as on every other occasion
the virtues of a Christian and a minister
of peace. With a humility
and charity that showed how well
the strong and naturally impulsive
man had subdued his passions, he
endeavored to appease the anger of
his assailant by an apology, which,
while it was justly calculated to remove
all cause of offence, was accompanied
with a solemn vindication
of himself and companions from the
unjust imputation just cast upon
them. He said:</p>

<p>"You must excuse me. I did not
mean to give you the lie. I should
be very sorry to do so. The words
I used are those we use in the schools
when a doubtful question is advanced,
and they mean no offence. Therefore,
I ask you to pardon me."</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon Dieu</span>," said Champlain, "you
swear well for a reformer!"</p>

<p>"I knew it," replied Michel; "I
should be content if I had struck
that Jesuit who gave me the lie before
my general."</p>

<p>The unfortunate Michel continued
in this way unceasingly to rave over
the pretended insult, which no apologies
could obliterate. He died
shortly afterward in one of his paroxysms
of fury, and was interred under
the rocks of Tadoussac. It was
not permitted to him to execute his
threatened vengeance on the Jesuit,
whom he was the first to insult, and
whom he never forgave, though himself
forgiven.</p>

<p>Father Brébeuf, together with the
truly great and Catholic Champlain,
the governor of Quebec, and with
the other missionaries, were carried
prisoners to England, whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
they all made their way to
France.</p>

<p>Sad at this interruption of their
work of love among the benighted
sons of the Western wilds, the missionaries
did not despair, but only
awaited the restoration of Canada
to France in order to resume their
labors. In the volume of his travels
published by Champlain in 1632, is
embraced the treatise on the Huron
language which Father Brébeuf had
prepared during his three years' residence
with that tribe, and which, in
our own times, has been republished
in the <cite>Transactions of the American
Antiquarian Society</cite>, as a most precious
contribution to learning.</p>

<p>The English government disavowed
the conduct of Kirk, and Canada
was restored to France during the
year 1632. As the conversion of
the native tribes was ever one of
the leading features in the policy of
Catholic statesmen in the colonization
of this continent, it was determined
to renew the missions which
we have seen interrupted. In selecting
missionaries for this task, the
choice fell not upon the Jesuits, nor
the Recollects, as might have been
expected, but upon the Capuchins;
and it was only when these good fathers
represented to Cardinal Richelieu
that the Jesuits had already been
laboring with fidelity and success in
that vineyard, and requested that the
missions might be again confided to
them, that Fathers Paul Lejeune and
Anne de Nouë, with a lay brother,
were sent out in 1632. They arrived
at Tadoussac on the twelfth of July.
It soon became Father Brébeuf's
great privilege and happiness to follow
them. On the twenty-second of
May, 1633, to the great joy of Quebec,
Champlain returned to resume
his sway in Canada, and Father Brébeuf
accompanied him together with
Fathers Massé, Daniel, and Devost.
Though Father Brébeuf was not inactive
about Quebec, still his heart
longed for the Huron homes and
council-fires, and still more for Huron
souls. Shortly afterward, he had the
consolation of beholding the faithful
Louis Amantacha, a Christian Huron,
arriving at Quebec, followed by
the usual Indian flotilla of canoes.
A council was held, sixty chiefs sat
in a circle round the council-fire, and
the noble Champlain, the intrepid
Brébeuf, and the zealous Lallemant,
stood in their midst. A treaty of
friendship was concluded between
the French and the Hurons, and, in
confiding the missionaries to his new
allies, Champlain thus addressed the
latter: "These we consider as fathers,
these are dearer to us than life.
Think not that they have left France
under pressure of want; no, they
were there in high esteem: they come
not to gather up your furs, but to
open to you the doors of eternal life.
If you love the French, as you say
you love them, then love and honor
these our fathers." This address was
responded to by two of the chiefs,
who were followed by Father Brébeuf
in his broken Huron, "the assembly
jerking in unison, from the bottom
of their throats, repeated ejaculations
of applause." The members of the
council then crowded round him,
each claiming the privilege of carrying
him in his canoe. And the Indians
from the different towns began
now to contend among themselves
for the honor of possessing Father
Brébeuf for their respective settlements.
The contest was soon decided
in favor of Rochelle, the most
populous of the Huron villages. On
the eighth of August, the effects of
Father Brébeuf and of his companions,
Fathers Daniel and Devost,
were already on board the canoes,
when another more serious difficulty
arose: an Indian murderer had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
arrested by order of Champlain, in
consequence of which an enraged
Algonquin chief declared that no
Frenchman should enter the flotilla.
The Hurons were ready and anxious
to convey the fathers, but they
feared the consequences of a rupture
with the Algonquins. The fathers
were thus constrained, to the common
sorrow of themselves and their
Hurons, to behold the flotilla depart
without them. But the last scene
in this separation was yet more touching.
The faithful and pious Louis
Amantacha, overwhelmed with sorrow
at the loss of the fathers, lingered
in their company to the last moment,
humbly made his confession,
and, for the last time for him, this
Christian warrior received the holy
communion from the hands of Father
Brébeuf. Then, having rejoined his
companions, the flotilla quickly glided
from the view of those who would
have laid down their lives to save
the souls of those benighted and
thoughtless voyagers.</p>

<p>Father Brébeuf and his companions
returned to labor for a time longer
among the French and Indians in and
about Quebec, where their labors were
full of zeal and not without success.
It was here that Father Brébeuf baptized
Sasousmat, the first adult upon
whom he conferred that sacrament.
While in health, Sasousmat had requested
that he might be sent to
France for instruction in the faith,
but he was now overtaken by a dreadful
illness, which deprived him of
reason. Father Brébeuf visited him
while in this state, and, returning from
his couch to the altar, he offered up
for his benefit the holy sacrifice of
the Mass in honor of St. Joseph, the
glorious patron of the country; his
prayer of sacrifice was heard in heaven,
and Sasousmat was restored to
his mind. Father Brébeuf then instructed
him, and the joyful neophyte
ardently and touchingly entreated the
father to baptize him. But the cautious
and conscientious priest deferred
the sacrament, to the astonishment
of the Indians, whose habit was to
refuse nothing to the sick. One of
Sasousmat's Indian friends said to the
father, with great impatience: "Thou
hast no sense; pour a little water on
him, and it is done." "No," replied
the priest of God, "I would involve
myself in ruin were I to baptize,
without necessity, an infidel and unbeliever
not fully instructed." The
patient was afterwards removed to
the residence of Notre Dame des
Anges, where he continued to receive
the instructions of the father, and
where he grew desperately ill, and
was finally in an hour of danger baptized.
At the moment of his decease,
a resplendent meteoric light illumined
the death-room, and shone far around
about the country. There was afterwards
another adult, named Nassé,
a steadfast friend of the missionaries,
who fell dangerously ill, and was
nursed by Father Brébeuf. He too
made earnest entreaties to be baptized,
but the father subjected the
convert to long delays and probations,
and finally only bestowed the
sacrament when death was imminent.
Instances are related in which baptism
was refused to adults, even <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extremis</i>,
where the requisite dispositions were
wanting. Such examples, of which
there are not a few recorded in the
Jesuit <cite>Relations</cite>, besides exhibiting the
zeal and self-sacrificing labors of the
Catholic missionaries for the salvation
of souls, furnish us with a complete
refutation of the wanton calumny
that those early missionary priests
were in the habit of bestowing the
sacrament upon entire multitudes of
savages without previous instruction
or probation&mdash;a calumny now fully
refuted by the <cite>Relations</cite> and letters of
the fathers themselves, who, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
they penned the humble story of their
labors, to be transmitted to their
superiors in Europe, knew not that
the same would serve as evidence for
their own vindication.</p>

<p>With the return of spring, the time
again drew near for the appearance
of the usual flotilla of Indian canoes
at the trading post of Three Rivers.
On the 1st of July, Fathers Brébeuf
and Daniel repaired to Three Rivers,
to procure a passage in the flotilla for
the Huron country, and Father Devost
joined them in a few days. But
the canoes were slow in coming in;
the Hurons had sustained a terrific
defeat, losing two hundred braves,
and the gallant Christian warrior
Louis Amantacha was among the
slain. No sooner, however, had a
few canoes arrived, than Father
Brébeuf pressed forward to secure a
passage; but the hostile Algonquin
and the cautious Huron discovered innumerable
obstacles in the way of his
going with them, and it seemed that
he was again to be disappointed in
his hopes of reaching his beloved
mission. At length, by the influence
of the French commanders, which was
supported as usual by presents, it was
arranged that a passage should be
given to one missionary and two men,
and even then Father Brébeuf was
left out. He thus describes his difficulties:
"Never did I see voyage so
hampered and traversed by the common
enemy of man. It was by a
stroke of heaven that we advanced,
and an effect of the power of the
glorious St. Joseph, in whose honor
God inspired me to promise twenty
masses, in the despair of all things."
At the moment that this vow was
made, a Huron, who had agreed to
carry one of the Frenchmen in his
canoe, was suddenly inspired to take
Father Brébeuf in his stead. Thus
a passage was secured. But such
were the hurry, confusion, and want
of accommodation, that the missionaries
were compelled to leave behind
them all their effects, except such
as were necessary for saying Mass.
Too glad to be admitted into this
vineyard which they had so long
sought, they cheerfully made every
sacrifice. With light and joyous
hearts and ready hands, they plied
the oar from morning till night; they
recited the sacred office by the evening
fire; they nursed all who fell sick
on the voyage with so much charity
and tenderness as to melt the hearts
of those savage sons of the wilderness;
at fifty different points, where
the passage was dangerous or obstructed,
they volunteered to carry the
packages, and even the canoes, on
their shoulders around the portages;
and at one place Father Brébeuf
barely escaped a watery grave at a
rapid where his canoe was hurried
over the impetuous current. At
length, after much suffering, they
reached the shores of the Huron
country on the 5th of August, 1634.</p>

<p>The following description of this
remarkable journey of the fathers is
from the eloquent and graphic, but
not always impartial, pages of Parkman's
<cite>Jesuits in North America</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"They reckoned the distance at nine
hundred miles; but distance was the
least repellant feature of this most arduous
journey. Barefoot, lest their shoes
should injure the frail vessel, each
crouched in his canoe, toiling with unpractised
hands to propel it. Before
him, week after week, he saw the same
lank, unkempt hair, the same tawny
shoulders and long, naked arms, ceaselessly
plying the paddle. The canoes
were soon separated, and for more than
a month the Frenchmen rarely or never
met. Brébeuf spoke a little Huron, and
could converse with his escort; but Daniel
and Devost were doomed to a silence
unbroken save by the unintelligible complaints
and menaces of the Indians, of
whom many were sick with the epidemic,
and all were terrified, desponding, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
sullen. Their only food was a pittance
of Indian corn, crushed between two
stones and mixed with water. The toil
was extreme. Brébeuf counted thirty-five
portages, where the canoes were lifted
from the water and carried on the
shoulders of the voyagers around rapids
and cataracts. More than fifty times, besides,
they were forced to wade in the
raging current, pushing up their empty
barks, or dragging them with ropes. Brébeuf
tried to do his part, but the boulders
and sharp rocks wounded his naked feet,
and compelled him to desist. He and his
companions bore their share of the baggage
across the portages, sometimes a
distance of several miles. Four trips, at
the least, were required to convey the
whole. The way was through the dense
forest, encumbered with rocks and logs,
tangled with roots and underbrush, damp
with perpetual shade, and redolent of decayed
leaves and mouldering wood. The
Indians themselves were often spent with
fatigue. Brébeuf, a man of iron frame
and a nature unconquerably resolute,
doubted if his strength would sustain
him to the journey's end. He complains
that he had no moment to read his breviary,
except by the moonlight or the fire
when stretched out to sleep on a bare
rock by some savage cataract of the Ottawa,
or in a damp nook of the adjacent
forest.</p>

<p>"Descending French River and following
the lonely shores of the great Georgian
Bay, the canoe which carried Brébeuf
at length neared its destination, thirty
days after leaving Three Rivers. Before
him, stretched in savage slumber, lay the
forest shore of the Hurons. Did his spirit
sink as he approached his dreary home,
oppressed with a dark foreboding of what
the future should bring forth? There is
some reason to think so. Yet it was but
the shadow of a moment; for his masculine
heart had lost the sense of fear, and
his intrepid nature was fired with a zeal
before which doubts and uncertainties
fled like the mists of the morning. Not
the grim enthusiasm of negation, tearing
up the weeds of rooted falsehood, or with
bold hand felling to the earth the baneful
growth of overshadowing abuses; his
was the ancient faith uncurtailed, redeemed
from the decay of centuries, kindled
with a new life, and stimulated to a preternatural
growth and fruitfulness."</p></blockquote>

<p>But Father Brébeuf's trials did not
end here, for the ungrateful Indians,
who lived twenty miles below Father
Brébeuf's destination, forgetting all
his kindness and sacrifices and despising
his entreaties, abandoned him
on this desolate shore. In this distress,
he fell upon his knees and
thanked God for all his favors, and
especially for bringing him again into
the country of the Hurons. Beseeching
Providence to guide his steps, and
saluting the guardian angel of the
land with a dedication of himself to
the conversion of those tribes, he took
only such articles as he could in no
event dispense with, and, concealing
the rest, started forth in that vast
wilderness, not knowing whither his
steps might carry him. Providence
guided those steps: he discovered
the site of the former village, Toanché,
in which he had resided three years,
and even the blackened ruins of his
cabin, in which, for the same time,
he had offered up the Holy Sacrifice;
but the village was destroyed and the
encampment shifted to another place.
Striking upon a trail, he advanced full
of hope, and soon he suddenly stood
in the midst of his Huron friends, in
their new village of Ihonatiria. A
shout of welcome from a hundred
voices&mdash;"Echon! Echon!"&mdash;greeted
the joyous messenger of salvation.
He immediately threw himself upon
the hospitality of the generous chief,
Awandoay, from whom he obtained
men to go for his packages; he retraced
his weary steps with them, and
it was one o'clock in the morning before
all was safely lodged in the village
of Ihonatiria. The other fathers,
after suffering similar ill-treatment from
the Indians of the flotilla in whose
canoes they came, finally found their
way also, one by one, to Ihonatiria,
in great distress.</p>

<p>For some time they partook of the
liberal hospitality of Awandoay; but,
Father Brébeuf having decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
make Ihonatiria the mission headquarters,
they now constructed a residence
for themselves, thirty-six by
twenty-one feet, in which the centre
was their hall, parlor, and business-room,
leading, on the one side, to the
chapel, and, on the other, to what was
at the same time kitchen, refectory,
and dormitory. This rude hut&mdash;indeed,
everything about the missionaries&mdash;awakened
the amazement of
these simple sons of the forest. They
came in crowds from all parts of the
Huron country to see the wonderful
things possessed by the fathers, the
fame of which had spread through
the land. There was the mill for
grinding corn, which they viewed
with admiration, and which they delighted
to turn without ceasing. There
were a prism and magnet, whose
qualities struck them with surprise
and pleasure. There was a magnifying-glass
which, to their amazement,
made a flea as large as a monster;
and a multiplying lens which possessed
the mysterious power of creating
instantly eleven beads out of one.
But the clock, which hung on the
wall of the missionary cabin, was to
these untutored savages the greatest
miracle of all. The assembled warriors,
with their wives and children,
would sit in silence on the ground,
waiting an entire hour for the clock
to strike the time of the day. They
listened to it ticking every second
and marking every minute of the
twenty-four hours; they thought it
was a thing of life; inquired when,
how, and upon what it fed. They
called it sometimes the "Day Chief"
and sometimes the "Captain," and
expressed their awe of so mysterious
and supernatural a being by the constant
cry of "Ondaki! Ondaki!!"
"What does the Captain say now?"
was the repeated question. The
fathers were obliged to establish certain
regulations for visitors, whose
presence would have left them no
time for rest or devotion during the
twenty-four hours, while, at the same
time, they availed themselves of these
curiosities for attracting the Indians
to the mission cross before their door
and to the first simple lessons in religion.
They thus interpreted the
strokes of the clock: "When he
strikes twelve times, he says, 'Hang
on the kettle,' and when he strikes
four times, he says, 'Get up and go
home.'" The Indians rigidly obeyed
these commands of the little "Day
Chief." The crowd was densest at
the stroke of twelve, when the kettle
was hung and the fathers' sagamite
passed around; and at the stroke of
four, all arose at once and departed,
leaving their good entertainers to say
their office and rosary, study and make
notes on the Huron language, write
letters to their superiors, and consult
over the plans for conducting the
mission. The fathers also gave some
lessons to their Huron friends on the
subject of self-defence and military
engineering. The Hurons, living in
constant dread of the Iroquois, were
glad to learn a more perfect way of
constructing their palisade forts,
which they had been accustomed
to make round, but which the
Frenchmen now taught them to
make rectangular, with small flanking
towers at the corners for the arquebusmen.
And, in case of actual
attack, the aid of the four Frenchmen,
armed with arquebuses, who had
come with the missionaries from
Three Rivers, was promised, to enable
them to defend their wives,
children, and homes from the unsparing
attacks of their relentless
enemies.</p>

<p>The Indian children were the especial
objects of the solicitude of
these untiring missionaries. They
assembled these frequently at their
house, on which occasions Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
Brébeuf, the more effectually to inspire
respect, appeared in surplice
and baretta. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater Noster</i> was
chanted in Huron rhyme, into which
it had been translated by Father
Daniel; and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ave</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credo</i> and
Ten Commandments were recited.
The children were examined in their
past lessons, and instructed in new
ones, and then dismissed joyously
with presents of beads and dried
fruits. Soon the village resounded
with the rhymes of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pater Noster</i>,
and the little catechumens vied with
each other at home in making the
sign of the cross and reciting the
commandments.</p>

<p>To the adults the fathers earnestly
announced Christ crucified, and endeavored
to turn their admiration
from the clock and other curiosities
of the mission house, which, as they
said, were but creatures, to the Creator,
to heaven, and to the faith.
The first-fruits of the mission were
soon gathered; several infants, in
danger of death, were baptized, and
several adults were also admitted into
the Christian church through the
same regenerating waters.</p>

<p>But the enemies of religion and of
truth were jealously watching these
successes, and soon the fathers encountered
the same opposition that always
besets the introduction of Christianity
into heathen nations; that is,
the jealousy and hatred of the native
priests, or officials entrusted with the
matters of religion or the superstitious
rites of the country. These, among
our American tribes, were the medicine
men. These wicked sorcerers
accused Father Brébeuf and his companions
of causing the drought, of
blighting the crops, of introducing
the plague, in fine, of every evil that
afflicted the country or any of the
people. The missionaries began to
be insulted, the cross before their
residence was turned into a target,
and curses and imprecations greeted
them on every side. But the prayers
of the fathers, and especially a novena
of masses in honor of St. Joseph,
were soon followed by copious rains,
and the medicine-men were confounded,
while the fathers were received
with honor and esteem. The
old and young were instructed in
the faith, catechetical classes were
opened, and all ages and conditions
took pleasure in contending for the
pictures, medals, and other little rewards
which were bestowed upon
the studious. On Sundays, the Indians
were assembled at Mass; but, in
imitation of the custom which prevailed
in the early church, Father
Brébeuf dismissed them at the offertory,
after reciting for them the
prayers they had learned. In the
afternoon, catechetical instructions
were given, and all were examined
on what they had learned during the
week. In August, 1635, Fathers
Pijart and Mercier, then recently arrived
from France, came into the
Huron country to join the little missionary
band, who were, even after
this increase of their force, kept constantly
laboring.</p>

<p>In April, 1636, the missionaries
attended the "feast of the dead," a
great solemnity of the Indians, when
the bones of their dead are taken
down from their aerial tombs, and,
being wrapped in the richest furs,
and surrounded with various implements,
are deposited in the common
mound, amid the songs, games, and
dancing of the living. Father Brébeuf,
the courageous champion of the
faith, seized upon this occasion to announce
the saving word of truth in
the very midst of the ancient and
most cherished rites of a heathen
superstition. He declared that such
ceremonies were utterly vain and fruitless
for souls which, like the souls of
all in that mound, were lost for ever;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
that souls on death went either to a
realm of bliss or a world of woe;
that the living alone could choose,
and, if they preferred the former, he
and the other fathers were there to
show the way. This speech was accompanied
with a present to the assembled
chiefs, a means most effectual
in gaining the good-will of the Indians.
The latter offered no opposition
to the baptism of their infants, and
expressed themselves as if well disposed
towards the faith preached by
the fathers. In December, the mission
among the Hurons was formally
consecrated to the Immaculate Conception.
Baptism was administered
to nearly thirty of the tribe, amongst
whom was one, a little girl, of singular
interest, named Mary Conception.
This little child was remarkable for
her love of prayer and her fondness
for the missionaries and whatever
pertained to religion; she ran as
gaily to catechism as the other children
to their play, and took a singular
pleasure in walking beside the missionary
as he was reciting his office,
making the sign of the cross and
praying louder whenever he turned
in his walk. In 1635, fourteen baptisms
were reported by the fathers,
and in July, 1636, eighty-six, amongst
whom was the chief, who was sincerely
converted to the faith. Father
Brébeuf made many excursions to
distant villages and families. In
October, he visited the family of
Louis de Sainte Foi, who, having
been taken to France by the fathers,
was baptized at Rouen, but was now
grown cold in his religion. This
visit, in which Father Brébeuf was
accompanied by Father Pijart, rekindled
the ardor of the chief, and was
the occasion of announcing the commandments
of God to all his family.
Devotion to the Blessed Virgin, appealing
as it does to the best natural
feelings of the human heart, as well
as to the highest and purest motives of
religion, was easily received, especially
among the Indian mothers, to
whom she was proposed for imitation
by Father Brébeuf. He composed for
them, and in their own language, beautiful
prayers of invocation to the
Mother of God. So great was his proficiency
in the Huron language, that
he was able to attach to his relation
of this year a treatise on the language
and another on the customs
of the Hurons, the former of which
has been published in English.</p>

<p>It was about this time that a delegation
of Algonquin braves came to
solicit the alliance of the Hurons
against the Iroquois. Failing to
secure their point with the Hurons,
the Algonquins next turned to the
missionaries and endeavored to detach
them from the Hurons, and
offered, as an inducement to Father
Brébeuf, to make him one of their
great chiefs. Father Brébeuf, with a
smile, replied, that he had left home
and fortune to gain souls, not to become
rich or to gain honors in war,
and dismissed the negotiators as
usual with a present.</p>

<p>The removal of the headquarters
of the mission from Ihonatiria to
Ossossané had been several times
mooted; one day, as Father Brébeuf
was travelling to visit a sick Christian,
he was met by the chief of Ossossané,
who so forcibly urged the change
that Father Brébeuf was induced to
promise them a compliance with what
had been in fact his previous design.
A promise was readily made on the
other side that the villagers of Ossossané
would the following year erect
the necessary accommodations for
the fathers. When the people of
Ihonatiria heard this, their chief, at
daybreak, from the top of his cabin
summoned all his people out to rebuild
the cabin of the black gown.
Old and young now went forth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
obey the summons, and soon the
work was completed. When the next
season for the feast of the dead came
round, a great change was observable
in its celebration, a proof of the influence
of Christian sentiments with
the people. The accustomed magnificence
was dispensed with, and
those who died Christians were not
reburied, even in a separate portion
of the common tomb. The ceremony
consisted in nothing more than a
touching manifestation of the affection
of the living for their deceased friends,
and the missionaries were too prudent
to interfere. In order to show how
earnest our missionaries were for the
conversion of these tribes, it is worth
recording that they established a
Huron seminary at Quebec, and
during this year Fathers Daniel and
Devost departed from Huronia for
Quebec, with several young Hurons
destined for students in this institution.
It was also during this
year that Fathers Garnier, Chastelain,
and Jogues arrived from
France, and entered this promising
vineyard.</p>

<p>Shortly after these arrivals, a contagious
fever broke out in the Huron
country, and several of the missionaries
were seized with the malady.
It would be impossible, within the
space allotted to this memoir, to detail
all their sufferings and privations.
The hardy Brébeuf and the others
that were not taken down, became
the faithful and constant nurses of
their sick companions, and, when these
were restored, the entire missionary
band dedicated themselves to the
nursing and spiritual succor of the
afflicted people. Here, again, the
fathers met with the usual obstacles
and annoyances from the native sorcerers.
The medicine-men, in whom
the Indians had implicit confidence,
especially in sickness, resorted to their
usual tricks, and the villages resounded
with horrid superstitious orgies. Many
refused to let the fathers baptize their
dying infants. Others, however,
having seen the utter failure of their
sorcerers to effect a single cure, and
having observed how the Christian
baptism was frequently followed by a
restoration of the body also to health,
had recourse to the missionaries. But
in such cases their visits of mercy
were obstructed by the insults, the
threats, and ill-usage of the excited
rabble. But, as Bancroft remarks,
"the Jesuit never receded a foot."
He pressed forward with love and
courage, frequently forcing his way
to the couch of the dying, and encountering
threatened death to save
a single soul. In order to propitiate
the mercy of Heaven for this afflicted
people, Father Brébeuf assembled a
council of the chiefs of several villages,
and succeeded so far as to induce
them, in behalf of themselves and
their people, to promise solemnly, in
the presence of God, that they would
renounce their superstitions, embrace
the faith of Jesus Christ, conform
their marriages to the Christian standard,
and build chapels for the service
of the one true God. With the solemnity
of this scene, however, passed
away also their good resolutions.
The Indian, ever inconsistent, except
in his attachment to his idols and his
hunting-grounds, was soon again
seen raving at the frenzied words
and incantations of the sorcerer Tonnerananont,
who professed himself to
be a devil incarnate. The plague
continued to rage; not even the frosts
of winter arrested its destructive
powers. Night and day Father Brébeuf
and his companions were travelling
and laboring for those miserable
and inconstant savages. They went
about over the country administering
remedies for the maladies of the body
as well as those of the soul. Besides
relieving many by bleeding and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
simple remedies, their heroic labors
were rewarded with other fruits far
sweeter to them, the baptism of two
hundred and fifty expiring infants
and adults. The bold and fearless
advances and the devoted services
of the Jesuit fathers during this
season of disease and death may well
have called forth from Sparks the
remark that "humanity can claim
no higher honor than that such examples
have existed." In the spring
the pestilence abated, and the usual
and regular duties and labors of the
mission were resumed. His superior
knowledge of the language devolved
upon Father Brébeuf the greater
burthen of instructing and catechising
the natives. In May, he called a
council of the chiefs of Ossossané,
and reminded them of their promise
to build a cabin for the fathers. The
appeal was responded to, and, on the
fifth of June, Father Pijart offered
up the Mass of the Holy Trinity at
Ossossané, in "our own House of the
Immaculate Conception." On Trinity
Sunday, another happiness was enjoyed
by Father Brébeuf, in the
baptism of the first adult at Ihonatiria.
This was Tsiwendaentaha, a chief
who had manifested great perseverance
in his wish to become a Christian;
he had repeatedly requested and
entreated to be baptized, and had
renounced all connection with the
medicine-men for three years, and,
what was remarkable among the
natives, had only once during that
time manifested any disposition towards
a relapse. After prolonged
probation and careful instruction,
Father Brébeuf baptized him on
Trinity Sunday, conferring upon him
the Christian name of Peter. The
ceremony was surrounded with as
much magnificence as the infant
church in that wilderness could bring,
and in the presence of immense crowds
of Hurons. The corner-stone of the
new church was laid on the same
occasion.</p>

<p>These consolations of the mission
were soon succeeded by direful calamities.
Sickness still lingered in the
country. Having failed by their superstitious
rites to ameliorate the condition
of the people, the medicine-men
now accused the fathers of being
the cause of the pestilence, and even
of having a design of destroying the
country. A general outburst of indignation
now assailed the holy men.
Everything connected with them or
their religion now became objects of
suspicion&mdash;the pictures in the chapel,
their mission flag flying from the top
of a tree, the Mass in the morning,
the evening litany, the walk of the
missionaries by day, and especially
the clock, were successively condemned
as demons, and signals of pestilence
and death. It was even rumored
that the fathers concealed in
their cabin a dead body, which they
brought from France, and which was
now supposed to be the origin of the
infection. Goaded by their fears, and
incited by their sorcerers, the Indians
rushed into the missionary residence
to seize the mysterious corpse. As
superior, the principal weight of these
persecutions fell upon Father Brébeuf,
who endeavored in vain to dispel
such vain fears. The fathers
were insulted and threatened with
death in their own house. A general
council of chiefs and warriors
was held, in which they were universally
accused of causing all the evils
of the country. The courageous
Brébeuf stood in their midst to refute
their calumnies and expose their follies.
Nothing could appease them.
They offered to spare Father Brébeuf's
life if he would deliver up the
fatal cloth in which he had wrapt
the pestilence. He indignantly refused
to countenance their superstitions
by compliance, but told them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
to search his cabin and burn every
cloth if they thought proper. He
told them, however, that since they
had pressed him so far, he would
give them his opinion as to the origin
of their misfortunes, which he
then went on to trace to natural
causes and their own foolish method
of treating the sick, and spoke to
them of the power of God and his
justice in rewarding the good and
punishing the wicked. Father Brébeuf
concluded his remarks amidst
shouts and insults, but without losing
his characteristic courage and
calmness. Despite his unanswerable
appeal, the assembly thirsted for the
blood of at least one of the missionaries
as an experiment, and at any
moment one of those devoted men
might have fallen dead under the
hatchet of some enraged savage.
Repeated councils were held, and
the death of the strangers was resolved
upon. The residence was burned,
the stake prepared, and Father
Brébeuf led forth. Having prepared
himself for death, he now, in imitation
of the Huron custom, gave
the usual feast, in order to show that
he did not shrink from giving his life
in testimony of the faith he had
preached to them. Just before the
moment of his execution arrived, Father
Brébeuf was summoned to a
council, where, amid insult and interruption,
he delivered another speech
in advocacy of the faith, instead of
explaining the plague, and, by one of
those sudden changes of temper not
unusual in Indian assemblies, he was
acquitted and set free. As he passed
from the wigwam of the council, he
saw one of his greatest persecutors
fall dead at his feet, under a stroke
from the murderous tomahawk: supposing
that, in the dim light of a far-spent
day, the murderer had mistaken
his victim, the future martyr asked:
"Was not that blow meant for
me?" "No," replied the warrior;
"pass on: he was a sorcerer, thou
art not." His companions were anxiously
awaiting the result; and when
he walked into their midst, they received
him as the dead restored to life.
They all united in returning thanks to
God for the safety of the superior of
the mission, and especially for the
announcement which that apostolic
man made to them, that they might
yet hope to remain in that country,
and labor for the salvation of their
persecutors.</p>

<p>The firm and uncompromising character
of Father Brébeuf is strikingly
illustrated in contrast with the fickleness
of the Indians, the difference
between faith and superstition, by another
circumstance which occurred
during the prevalence of the pestilence.
The Hurons, after repeated
recourse to their medicine-men, whose
vile practices they now saw to be
barren of results, resolved to have
recourse to the fathers, whom they
invited to attend a council. "What
must we do that your God may take
pity on us?" they asked of the Christian
priests. Father Brébeuf immediately
answered: "Believe in him;
keep his commandments; abjure your
faith in dreams; take but one wife,
and be true to her; give up your
superstitious feasts; renounce your
assemblies of debauchery; eat no
human flesh; never give feasts to
demons; and make a vow that, if
God will deliver you from this pest,
you will build a chapel to offer him
thanksgiving and praise."</p>

<p>In the midst of their sufferings
and the persecutions they sustained,
these heroic missionaries ceased not
a single moment their labors of mercy
and salvation. Themselves outcast
and friendless, they visited and
nursed the sick; repulsed, they pressed
forward to the bedside of the dying;
reviled for their religion, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
still announced its saving truths;
threatened with death, they bestowed
the bread of life eternal upon
others, even while the deadly tomahawk
glistened over their heads.
Such was the life the early Catholic
missionaries led upon our borders;
such, too, were the labors and sacrifices
which preluded others, equally
sublime and heroic, within the territory
of our own republic.</p>

<p>Among the converts of Father
Brébeuf at Ossossané was Joseph
Chiwattenwha, a nephew on the maternal
side to the head chief of the
Hurons. From the time that he listened
to Father Brébeuf's sermon at
the "feast of the dead," he had
been an earnest and regular catechumen.
He rejected the prevailing
superstitions of his race, and was remarkable
for the purity of his morals,
his freedom from the common Indian
vice of gambling, and for his rare
conjugal fidelity. Notwithstanding
his virtues, and his repeated requests
to be baptized, Father Brébeuf delayed
the sacrament, to make sure of
his thorough conversion, and, finally,
only conferred it upon him in a moment
of danger. The chief recovered
from his illness, and, calling all
his friends together at a grand banquet,
he addressed them zealously in
favor of the faith he had embraced.
His faith and zeal were rewarded by
the manifest protection of Heaven
over himself and his family during
the prevalence of the fever.</p>

<p class="center"><small>TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.</small></p>

<h2>OUR LADY OF LOURDES.</h2>

<p class="center">BY HENRI LASSERRE.</p>


<h3>BOOK EIGHTH.<br />

I.</h3>

<p>The appointment by the Bishop
of a commission of examination, and
the analysis of M. Filhol, deprived
Baron Massy, M. Rouland, and M.
Jacomet of all pretext for continuing
violent measures, or for maintaining
about the grotto strict prohibitions,
barriers, and guards.</p>

<p>In justification of the restrictions
previously made, it had been said:
"Considering that it is very desirable,
<i>in the interest of religion</i>, to put
an end to the <i>deplorable</i> scenes now
presented at the grotto of Massabielle."
Now the Bishop, by declaring
the matter to be of sufficient
importance for his intervention, and
by taking in hand the examination
of those things which affected the
interests of religion, had deprived the
civil power of this motive which it
had made so prominent.</p>

<p>In justification of the prohibition
to go and drink at the spring which
had gushed out under the hand of
Bernadette, it had been urged "that
the care of the local public health
devolves upon the mayor," and that
this water "is suspected on good
grounds to contain mineral ingredients,
making it prudent, before permitting
its use, to wait for a scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
analysis to determine the applications
which may be made of it in medicine."
Now, M. Filhol, by his decision
that the water had no mineral
properties, and that it could be drunk
without inconvenience, had annihilated
in the name of science and of
medicine this plea of "the public
health."</p>

<p>If, then, these considerations had
been real reasons for the civil power,
and not merely specious pretexts; if
it had really been acting in the "interests
of religion and the public
health," instead of being under the
sway of evil passions and intolerance;
or if, in a word, it had been sincere
instead of being hypocritical, it would
now have had nothing to do but to
remove its prohibitions and barriers;
it would have only had to leave the
people perfectly free to drink of this
fountain, the perfect harmlessness of
which had been attested by science,
and to recognize their right to kneel
at the foot of these mysterious rocks,
where for the future the church was
to be on the watch.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>But this was not the case. There
was a great obstacle to this course,
so clearly indicated by logic and conscience;
namely, pride. Pride was
the ruling spirit from one end of the
scale to the other, from Jacomet up
to Rouland, including Baron Massy
and the philosophical coterie. It
seemed hard to them to retreat and
lay down their arms. Pride never
surrenders. It prefers rather to take
an illogical position than to bow to
the authority of reason. Furious,
beside itself, and absurd, it revolts
against evidence. Like Satan, it
says, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non serviam</i>." It resists, it refuses
to bend, it stiffens its neck, till
suddenly it is broken by some contemptuous
and superior power.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>There remained for the official and
officious foes of superstition one last
weapon to use, one final struggle to
make. Though the battle seemed to
be certainly lost in the Pyrenees, perhaps
the lost position might be regained
in Paris, and the favor of
public opinion secured throughout
France and Europe, before the cosmopolitan
assemblage of tourists and
bathers, returning home, should
pass their severe judgments on the
other side. This was tried. A formidable
attack was made by the irreligious
press of Paris, the provinces,
and other countries, upon the events
at Lourdes and the Bishop's ordinance.</p>

<p>While the generals of the infidel
army engaged in a decisive combat
upon this vast scale, the duty of the
Prefect of Hautes-Pyrenees, like that
of Kellerman at Valmy, was to hold
at all costs his line of operation, not
to recede a single foot from it, and
not to capitulate on any terms. The
intrepidity of Baron Massy was well
known, and it was understood that
neither arguments nor the most surprising
miracles would prevail over
his invincible firmness. He would
stand by his sinking ship to the last.
The absurd had in him an excellent
champion.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Débats</i>, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Siècle</i>,
<cite>Presse</cite>, <cite>Indépendance Belge</cite>, and various
foreign journals, also came manfully
to the rescue. The smallest
newspapers of the smallest countries
considered it an honor to serve in
this campaign against the supernatural.
We find, in fact, among the
combatants, a microscopic sheet
called the <cite>Courant</cite>, published at
Amsterdam.</p>

<p>Some, like the <cite>Presse</cite>, by the pen
of M. Guéroult, or the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Siècle</i>, by
those of MM. Bénard and Jourdan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
attacked the very idea of miracles,
declaring that they had had their
day, that the discussion of them was
no longer admissible, and to examine
into a question which had already
been decided by the light of philosophy
was beneath the dignity of free
examen. "Miracles," said M. Guéroult,
"belong to a state of civilization
which is almost gone by.
Though God does not change, the
conception which men form of him
changes from age to age, according
to the prevailing standard of morality
and intelligence. Ignorant nations
who do not understand the harmony
of the laws by which the universe
is governed imagine that they see
continual exceptions to these laws.
They think that God appears and
speaks to them, or sends them a
message by his angels, almost
daily. But as society becomes more
intelligent and better informed, and
as the sciences based on observation
come in to counteract the vagaries
of the imagination, all this mythology
disappears. Man does not on that
account become less religious, but
more so, though in a different manner.
He does not any longer see
gods and goddesses, angels and demons,
face to face; but he seeks to
discover the divine will as manifested
in the laws of the world. Miracles,
which at certain periods have been
necessary to faith and served to convey
the most important truths, have
become in our day the bugbear of
all serious conviction." M. Guéroult
declared that, if he should be told
that the most remarkable miracle
was occurring close by his house on
the Place de la Concorde, he would
not take a step out of his way to see
it. "If such occurrences," added
he, "can occupy a place for a time
among the superstitious trumpery of
the ignorant masses, they only excite
a smile of contempt among enlightened
men, among those whose opinion
is sure to be ultimately adopted
by all the world."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>Other papers valiantly set to work
to distort the facts. Though also
attacking miracles in principle, the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Siècle</i>, in spite of the enormous yield
of twenty thousand and odd litres a
day, still remained, in its capacity of
an enlightened and advanced journal,
at the old thesis of hallucination and
infiltration. "It seems difficult to
us," said M. Bénard, very gravely,
"to see a miracle in the hallucination
of a little girl of fourteen, or in the
oozing out of some water in a cave."</p>

<p>As for the miraculous cures, they
were easily disposed of as follows:
"Hydropathic physicians also claim
to effect the most extraordinary cures
by means of pure water, but they
have not as yet proclaimed upon the
house-tops that these cures are
miracles."<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>But the most curious example of
the good faith of the free-thinkers, or
of their sagacity in examining this
matter, is to be found in the Dutch
newspaper which we have mentioned
above, and whose weighty narrative
was reproduced by the French journals.
Let us see how this friend of
enlightenment enlightened the world
by his account of the matter:</p>

<p>"A new manifestation, designed to
excite and promote the fervor of the
faithful in the worship of the Blessed
Virgin, was imminent. The deliberations
of the bishops on this point had
resulted in the preparation of the
famous miracle of Lourdes. It is
well known that the Bishop of Tarbes
appointed a commission of inquiry.
The so-called conclusions of the report
of the commission, which is
composed of ecclesiastics and persons
in the pay of the clergy, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>prepared long before their first session.
<i>The pretended shepherdess Bernadette
is not an innocent peasant, but
a highly cultivated city girl of a very
wily character, who has passed several
months in a convent, where she was
taught the part she was to play. There,
before a small audience, rehearsals were
made long before the public performance.</i>
As will be observed, nothing
was wanting for the completeness of
this comedy, not even the usual rehearsals.
If at any time there is a
scarcity of actors at Paris, the places
can be admirably filled from the
ranks of the superior clergy. However,
the liberal press has made the
matter thoroughly ridiculous, and it
is not improbable that the clergy, in
their own interest, will see the necessity
of being prudent."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The information
of the journals seems
hardly to have been so accurate as
that which secured the simple faith
of His Excellency M. Rouland. The
public, it is evident, were treated with
no more respect than the minister.
This is too often the way in which
the opinion of those whom M. Guéroult
called in his article "enlightened
men," alluding, no doubt, to the torrent
of light thrown upon them by
the press, is formed.</p>

<p>Another point of attack besides the
actual events and the possibility of
miracles was the ordinance of the
Bishop of Tarbes. Philosophy,
in virtue of the infallibility of its
dogmas, protested against examination,
scientific study, and experiment.
"When some crazy person
sends a paper on perpetual motion or
the squaring of the circle to the Academy
of Science, the Academy passes
to the order of the day without wasting
time in criticising such lucubrations.
And there is no more need
of examination in the case of a supposed
miracle. Philosophy, in the
name of reason, passes to the order
of the day. To examine the claims
of the supernatural facts would be
to admit their possibility and to deny
its own principles. In such matters,
proofs and testimony count
for nothing. We do not discuss the
impossible, but dismiss it with a
shrug." Such was the central idea
of the thousand varied forms assumed
by the fiery and excited polemics of
the irreligious press. Vainly did it
persist in denial and perversion; it
was afraid to examine. False theories
prefer to remain in the fluctuation
and fog of pure speculation. By
some natural instinct of self-preservation,
they fear broad daylight, and
do not dare to descend with a steady
foot upon the firm ground of the experimental
method. They perceive
that only defeat awaits them there.</p>

<p>In this desperate struggle against
the evidence of facts and the rights
of reason, the liberal mask of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des Débats</i> unfortunately fell
off, and showed the depth of furious
intolerance concealed under its philosophical
exterior. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Journal des
Débats</i>, by the pen of M. Prévost-Paradol,
was terrified in advance at
the great weight which the report of
the commission and the decision of
the Bishop were sure to have, and
accordingly appealed to the secular
arm, beseeching Cæsar to put a stop
to the whole thing. "It is evident,"
said he, "that a striking manifestation
of divine power in favor of a religion
makes strongly for its individual
truth, for its superiority over
others, and its incontestable right to
govern souls. It is then an event of
a nature to produce numerous conversions,
both of dissenters and of infidels;
in other words, it is an instrument
of proselytism." He showed
also the political importance of the
result of the examination. "If this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
decision is favorable to the miracle,
it will have a tendency to dissolve
in that part of France the equilibrium
now existing between the religious and
civil powers. The ministers of a religion
in favor of which such prodigies
are authentically asserted are
quite different sort of people from
those which the Concordat provides
for. They have a very different sort
of authority over the people, and in
case of any collision they exert a very
different kind of influence from that
of the council of state and the prefect."</p>

<p>"We have sufficiently shown," said
the writer in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Débats</i>, "the importance
which the decision of the episcopal
commission at Tarbes must
have in various points of view. Now,
there is a truth here which should be
remembered, and of which M. de Morny
has just very properly reminded
the council-general at Puy-de-Dôme;
that is, that nothing of importance
can legally be done in France without
previous authority from the administration.
If, as M. de Morny
very justly remarks, one cannot move
a rock or dig a well without the consent
of the administration, still less
can one without its consent authorize
a miracle or establish a pilgrimage.
Any one who is concerned
with religious matters, and especially
with the opening of churches or
schools of dissenting bodies, knows
that the administration has not merely
one enactment, but twenty or thirty,
which makes it all-powerful in such
cases. The meeting of the commission
of the diocese of Tarbes can be
prevented or its session can be dissolved
in a hundred different ways by the
Concordat, by the penal code, by
the law of 1824, by the decree of
February, 1852, by the central authority,
by the municipal authority, by
all conceivable authorities. The decision
of this commission can also be
annulled by the legal opposition of
the administrative authority to the
erection of a chapel or to the distribution
of the miraculous water. The
same authority can prohibit and
break up all meetings of the people,
and prosecute the originators of such
meetings, etc." Having arrived at
this point, having notified Cæsar and
cried "caveant consules," the able
writer resumed, for form's sake, his
garb of liberalism. "What is our
object," said he hypocritically, "in establishing
this preventive right of the
administration? Is it to urge them
to use it? God forbid." And thus he
crept, by a sort of secret passage,
into the ranks of the friends of liberty.</p>

<p>The provincial journals echoed the
sentiments of those of Paris. The
battle became universal. The sergeants,
corporals, and privates of the
literary army pressed forward on the
steps of the marshals of free thought.
The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ere Impériale</i> of Tarbes charged
its blunderbuss with arguments
from Paris, and fired them off at the
supernatural every other day. The
little <i>Lavedan</i>, also, had picked up a
few grains of powder, rather dampened,
it must be owned, by the water
of the grotto, and did its best,
aided, according to report, by Jacomet,
to make its weekly penny-pistol
effective.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Univers</i>, the <cite>Union</cite>, and the
greater part of the Catholic papers
bravely met their universal attack.
Powerful talents lent themselves to the
service of the yet more powerful truth.
The Christian press re-established the
facts and demolished the miserable
quibbles of philosophic fanaticism.</p>

<p>"Meeting with some unexplained
facts to which the faith or the credulity
of the multitude attributes a supernatural
character, the civil authority,"
said M. Louis Veuillot, "has
decided without information, but also
without success, in the negative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
The spiritual authority comes in in its
turn; it is its right and its duty to
do so. But before making its judgment,
it obtains information. It institutes
a commission, an inquiry to
examine the alleged facts, to study
them, and determine their nature.
If they have actually occurred, and
are really supernatural, the commission
will say so. If they have not
occurred, or if they can be explained
on natural principles, the commission
will also acknowledge that
such is the case. What more can our
adversaries desire? Do they wish
the Bishop to abstain from this examination,
with a double danger before
him, either of failing to recognize
a signal favor which Almighty
God would grant to his people, or of
allowing a superstition to take root
among them?</p>

<p>"The Bishop must necessarily
have observed the strangeness of this
conviction which had become so
firm in the popular mind, upon the
word of a poor and ignorant little girl;
he must have asked also how these
cures could be accounted for, obtained
as they had been by means of a few
drops of pure water, swallowed or externally
applied.... And if there
have been in fact no cures, it must
be ascertained why the contrary has
been believed. But, supposing that
the water has no mineral ingredient,
as is said by the chemists, and that,
nevertheless, the cures are certain,
as many sick people and several physicians
attest, we do not see any difficulty
in recognizing in the case something
supernatural and miraculous,
with all due respect to the explanations
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Siècle</i>."</p>

<p>The vigorous champion contended
with all his enemies at once. A touch
of his pen sufficed to demolish the ridiculous
idea of denying the possibility
of miracles, and of refusing even
an examination to these startling
facts which a multitude had seen
with their own eyes and attested on
their knees. "If any one should
tell M. Guéroult that a great miracle
had been worked in the name of
Christ upon the Place de la Concorde,
he would not go, it seems, to
see it. This is prudent in him certainly,
for he is determined to remain
incredulous; and in presence
of such a spectacle he would not be
so certain of finding a natural explanation
which would dispense him
from going to confession. But he
would be still more prudent if he
would witness the miracle and believe,
yielding to the testimony which
God in his mercy would thus give
him. The people, however, will not
care for his absence, and will not be
at all disconcerted to hear that the
thing is not at all extraordinary, and
that they are the victims of delusion.
Things would take the same course
at Paris as at Lourdes; a miracle
would be proclaimed, and, if there
really had been one, it would have
its effect; that is, many men who
had not as yet '<i>sought to discover the
divine will</i>,' or who have not yet
been successful in their search, would
know and fulfil it; they would love
God with their whole heart, soul, and
mind, and their neighbors as themselves.
Such is the object which
God intends in working miracles;
and it is so much the worse for those
who refuse to profit by them.</p>

<p>"Those who reject the supernatural,
said an ancient writer, destroy
philosophy. They destroy it indeed,
and especially since the advent of
Christianity, because, wishing to take
God out of the world, they have no
longer any explanation for the world
or for humanity. As to this God
whom they exclude, some deny his
existence, that they may get entirely
rid of him; others make of him an
inert and indifferent being, having nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
to require and requiring nothing
from men, whom he abandons to
chance, having created them in a
freak of his disdainful power. Some,
denying him in their very affirmation,
as if they wished to satiate their ingratitude
by doing him a double injury,
pretend to find him in all things,
which theory dispenses them from
recognizing and adoring him anywhere
in particular. Meanwhile,
around them and even in themselves,
humanity confesses its God. They
reply by sophisms which are far from
contenting them, by sarcasms the
weakness of which they can hardly
conceal from themselves, and at last
their science and reason, driven back
to the absurd, deprive them of their
eyes and ears. They destroy all philosophy....
God, taking compassion
on the faith of the weak
which these false teachers would pervert,
shows himself by one of those
unusual displays of his power, which
is nevertheless <i>one of the laws of the
world</i>. They deny it. Look! we
do not wish to see!... David
said of the sinner, 'He has promised
himself in his heart to sin; he refuses
to understand, that he may not
be forced to do well.'</p>

<p>"Ah! no doubt," elsewhere exclaimed
the indignant logician, "there
is an unfortunate multitude on whom
all these commonplaces can be palmed
off without difficulty; but there
are also at Lourdes and elsewhere
some readers whose common-sense
is aroused, and who ask what will
become of history, evident facts, and
reason in such a system, with such a
determination to deny everything
without examination?</p>

<p>"As to preventing the episcopal
commission from acting, we doubt if
there are any laws conferring such a
power upon the government; if there
are, it will probably wisely abstain
from using its power. On one hand,
nothing could be more favorable to
superstition than to do so; the popular
credulity would then go astray
without restraint, for there is no law
which can oblige the Bishop to pronounce
upon a fact about which he
has not been able, and has even been
forbidden, to inform himself....
There is only one course for the enemies
of superstition, that is, to appoint
a commission themselves, to
make a counter-examination, and
publish its result, in case, of course,
that the one appointed by the Bishop
concludes in favor of the miracle.
For if it concludes that the reports
are false, or that there is some illusion,
this will not be needed."</p>

<p>The Catholic press, with a reserve
truly admirable in the midst of the
excitement of the dispute, refused to
decide as to the actual merits of the
case. It did not wish to anticipate
the verdict of the episcopal commission;
but confined itself to refuting
calumnies, absurd stories, and sophisms,
to defending the historical thesis
of the occurrence of supernatural
events, and to claiming in the name of
reason the right of examination and
freedom to ascertain the truth. "The
event at Lourdes," said the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Univers</i>,
"is not as yet verified, nor is its nature
determined. It may have been
a miracle, it may have been an illusion.
The decision of the Bishop will
settle the question.</p>

<p>"For our own part, we believe
that we have answered all that has
been seriously or even speciously said
about the events at Lourdes. We
shall leave the matter here. It was
not right that the press should be allowed
to heap around these facts all
the lies it could think of; but it
would not be becoming to give an
answer to the abundance of its scoffing
words. Wise men will appreciate
the wisdom and good faith of the
church, and as usual, after all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
turmoil, truth will secure for itself in
the world its little nucleus of adherents,
'<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pusillus grex</span>,' which nevertheless
is sufficient to maintain its ascendency
in the world."<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that, in the great polemical
question regarding miracles
which was being discussed on the
occasion of the events at Lourdes,
the two sides were acting on diametrically
opposite plans.</p>

<p>On the one hand, the Catholics
appealed to an impartial examination;
on the other, the pseudo-philosophers
feared the light. The former
said, "Let us have an examination;"
the latter cried, "Let us hear
no more of this matter." The former
had for their watchword liberty of
conscience; the latter implored Cæsar
to put a violent stop to this religious
movement, and to stifle it, not
by the power of arguments, but by
brute force.</p>

<p>Every impartial mind, placed by
its views or circumstances outside of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i>, could not help seeing
with the greatest clearness that justice,
truth, and reason were on the
Catholic side. All that was necessary
for this was, not to be blinded by
the fury of the contest or by an immovable
prejudice.</p>

<p>Although in the person of a commissary,
a prefect, and a minister the
administration had unfortunately taken
a very decided part in this important
affair, there still was a man of
authority who had not had anything
to do with it, and who was in the
conditions of perfect impartiality,
whatever his religious, philosophical,
and political views might be. Whether
there had been a manifestation of
the supernatural or not at Lourdes
made no difference in his calculations.
Neither his ambition, self-love,
doctrines, nor antecedents were
concerned in this question. What
mind is there which in such circumstances
cannot be fair, and give justice
and truth their rights? People
do not violate justice or outrage truth
except when they think it advantageous
to do so, under some strong
prompting of avarice, ambition, or
pride.</p>

<p>The man of whom we speak was
called Napoleon III., and was, as it
happened, Emperor of the French.</p>

<p>Impassible as usual, silent as the
granite sphinxes which watch at the
gates of Thebes, he followed the discussion,
observing the turns of the
battle, and waiting for the public
conscience to dictate, as it were, his
decision.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>While God was thus leaving his
work to the disputes of men, he did
not cease to grant visible graces to
the humble and believing souls which
came to the miraculous spring to implore
the aid of the sovereign power
of the Virgin Mother.</p>

<p>A child of the town of St. Justin,
in the department of Gers, named
Jean-Marie Tambourné, had been
for some months entirely disabled in
his right leg. The pains in it had
been so severe that the limb had
been twisted; and the foot, turned
entirely outward in these crises of
suffering, had come to form a right
angle with the other one. His general
health had rapidly deteriorated
under this state of continual suffering,
which robbed the poor boy of
his sleep as well as of his appetite.
He was in fact sinking into the
grave. His parents, who were tolerably
well off, had tried for his cure
all the treatments which had been
suggested by the physicians of the
neighborhood, but without success.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>They had also had recourse to the
waters of Blousson and to medicated
baths. The result had been almost
complete failure. Any very slight
and temporary alleviations which
were obtained always resulted in a
disastrous relapse.</p>

<p>The parents had at last lost all
confidence in the remedies of science.
Tired of medical treatment, they
turned their hopes toward the Mother
of God, who, it was said, had appeared
at the Massabielle rocks. On
the 23d of September, 1858, the little
boy was taken by his mother to
Lourdes, in the public coach. It was
a long distance, more than thirty
miles. Having reached the town, the
mother hastened to the grotto, carrying
her unfortunate child in her arms.
She bathed him in the miraculous
water, praying with fervor to her who
has been pleased to be called in the
Litany "Health of the Sick." The
child meanwhile had fallen into a
sort of ecstatic state. His eyes were
wide open, his lips apart. He seemed
to be gazing at some strange object.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said his
mother.</p>

<p>"I see the good God and the
Blessed Virgin," answered he.</p>

<p>The poor woman, at these words,
felt a great commotion at her heart,
and the sweat stood out upon her
face.</p>

<p>The child came to himself.</p>

<p>"Mother," said he, "my trouble is
gone. My feet do not ache now. I
can walk, I know I can; I am as
strong as ever I was."</p>

<p>Jean-Marie was right; he was indeed
cured. He went to the village
of Lourdes on foot, ate and slept
there. At the same time that his pain
and weakness ceased, his appetite and
sleep returned. The next day his
mother bathed him once more at the
grotto, and had a mass of thanksgiving
celebrated in the church at
Lourdes. Then they set out for
home; not in the coach this time,
but on foot.</p>

<p>When, after spending one night on
the road, they reached St. Justin, the
child saw his father, who was on the
watch, expecting no doubt that some
carriage would bring back the pilgrims.
Jean-Marie recognized him
far off, and ran to him.</p>

<p>The father almost fainted. But
his darling was already in his arms.
"Papa," cried he, "the Blessed Virgin
has cured me."</p>

<p>The news of this event spread
quickly enough in the town, where
everybody knew the child. They
flocked from all sides to see him.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p>The sister of a notary of Tarbes,
Jeanne-Marie Massot-Bordenave, had
become, after a long and serious illness,
almost entirely crippled in her
feet and hands. She walked only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>with extreme difficulty. Her hands,
habitually swollen, discolored, and
aching, were almost entirely useless.
Her fingers, bent back and stiff, could
not be straightened, and were completely
paralyzed. Having gone to
see her brother at Tarbes, she was
returning home to Arras, in the canton
of Aucun. She was alone in the inside
of the diligence. A flask of wine
which her brother had given her
having become uncorked and overturned,
she could not set it up or
cork it, so entirely powerless had her
fingers become.</p>

<p>Lourdes was upon the road. She
stopped there and went to the grotto.
Hardly had she plunged her hands
into the miraculous water, when she
perceived that they were instantly
coming back to life. Her fingers had
straightened, and suddenly recovered
their flexibility and strength. Successful
perhaps beyond her expectations,
she plunged her feet in the
miraculous water, and they were
healed like her hands. She fell upon
her knees. What did she say to the
Blessed Virgin? How did she thank
her? Such prayers, such bursts of
gratitude may be imagined, but not
expressed in words.</p>

<p>She then put on her shoes, and
with a confident step returned to the
town.</p>

<p>A young girl was walking in the
same direction, coming back from the
woods with an enormous bundle of
fagots on her head. It was warm,
and the poor little peasant was bathed
in perspiration. Exhausted, she sat
down upon a stone at the side of the
road, laying her too heavy burden at
her feet. At this moment Jeanne-Marie
Massot passed before her, returning
quickly and joyfully from the
fountain of grace. A good thought
occurred to her. She went up to the
child.</p>

<p>"My child," said she to her, "our
Lord has just granted me a great
favor. He has cured me; he has
taken away my burden. And in my
turn, I would like to aid and relieve
you."</p>

<p>So saying, Marie Massot took up
with her hands restored to life the
heavy fagots which lay on the ground,
put them on her head, and thus returned
to Lourdes, whence, less than
an hour before, she had gone out
weak and paralyzed. The first-fruits
of her recovered strength had been
nobly used; they had been consecrated
to charity. "Freely have you
received, freely give," said our Redeemer
to his disciples.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>A woman already advanced in age,
Marie Capdevielle, of the village of
Livron, in the neighborhood of
Lourdes, had also been cured of a
severe deafness which had troubled
her for a long time. "I seem," said
she, "to be in another world when I
hear the church-bells, which I have
not heard before for three years."</p>

<p>These cures, and many others,
continue to attest irrefutably the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>direct intervention of God. He
showed his power in restoring health
to the sick, and it was evident that,
if he had permitted persecution, it was
because it was necessary to the conduct
of his designs. It rested with
him to put a stop to it, and for that
purpose to bend and use as it should
please him the wills of the great ones
of the earth.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Polemics on the subject of the
grotto had become exhausted. In
France and abroad, public opinion
had passed judgment, not indeed on
the reality of the supernatural events,
but on the violent oppression to which
all liberty of belief and right of examination
were being subjected to in
a corner of the empire. The miserable
sophisms of anti-christian fanaticism
and of pseudo-philosophic intolerance
had not held their ground
before the cogent logic of the Catholic
journals. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Débats</i>, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Siècle</i>, the
<cite>Presse</cite>, and the common herd of irreligious
sheets kept silence, probably
sorry that they had undertaken this
unfortunate contest, and made so
much noise about these extraordinary
facts. They had only succeeded in
propagating and spreading everywhere
the renown of a host of miracles.
From Italy, Germany, and even more
distant lands, people were writing to
Lourdes for some of the sacred water.</p>

<p>At the Bureau of Public Worship,
M. Rouland persisted in putting himself
in the way of the most holy of
liberties, and in endeavoring to stop
the march of events.</p>

<p>At the grotto, Jacomet and the
guards continued to keep watch day
and night, and to bring the faithful
up before the courts. Judge Duprat
kept on sentencing them.</p>

<p>Between such a minister to back
him, and such agents to carry out his
will, Baron Massy remained bravely
in his desperately illogical situation,
and consoled himself with the omnipotence
of his arbitrary will. Continually
more and more exasperated
by seeing the vain pretexts of religion
and public order with which he had
at first wished to conceal his intolerance
slipping through his fingers, he
gave himself up gladly to the bitter
satisfaction of practising pure tyranny.
He remained deaf to the universal
protest. To all reasoning, to undeniable
evidence, he opposed his own
will: "Such is my determination."
It was sweet to him to be stronger
single-handed than all the multitudes,
stronger than the Bishop, stronger
than common sense, than miracles,
than the God who was manifested at
the grotto.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that two
eminent personages, Mgr. de Salinis,
Archbishop of Auch, and M. de
Rességuier, formerly of the deputies,
called on the Emperor, who was at
the time at Biarritz. Napoleon III.
was receiving at the same time from
various quarters petitions demanding
urgently, in virtue of the most sacred
rights, the annulment of the arbitrary
and violent measures of Baron
Massy. "Sire," said one of these
petitions, "we do not pretend to
settle the question as to the apparitions
of the Blessed Virgin, though
almost all the people here, on account
of the startling miracles which they
claim to have personally witnessed,
believe in the reality of these supernatural
manifestations. But it is
certain and indisputable that the
fountain which appeared suddenly,
and from which we are excluded, in
spite of the scientific analysis which
asserts its perfect harmlessness, has
been hurtful to no one; on the other
hand, it is undeniable that a great
number of persons declare that they
have there recovered their health. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
the name of the rights of conscience,
which should be independent of all
human power, permit the faithful to
go and pray there if they choose. In
the name of humanity, allow the sick
to go there for their cure, if they entertain
such a hope. In the name of
free thought, suffer the minds which
need information for their study and
examination to go there to unmask
error or to discover truth."</p>

<p>The Emperor, as we have said
above, was disinterested in the question,
or rather it was for his interest
not to waste his power in fruitlessly
opposing the course of events. It
was for his interest to listen to the
cry of souls asking for the liberty of
their faith, the cry of minds demanding
freedom to study and see for
themselves. It was for his interest
to be just, and not to crush, by an
arbitrary act and an evident denial
of justice, those who believed
the evidence of their senses, as well
as those who, though not yet believing,
still claimed the right to examine
publicly the mysterious occurrences
which were occupying the attention
of France.</p>

<p>It has been seen what wild romances
the honest Minister Rouland had
gravely accepted as incontestable
truths. The information which his
benevolent excellency must have given
the Emperor could hardly have
given the latter much light upon the
subject. The newspaper discussions,
although they had triumphantly
brought to light the right of one party
and the unjust intolerance of the
other, could not have given him a
perfectly clear idea of the situation.
At Biarritz only did it appear to him
in its fulness and complete details.</p>

<p>Napoleon III. was not a very demonstrative
sovereign; his thoughts
were seldom plainly indicated by his
words; rather by actions. As he
learned the absurd and violent proceedings
by which the minister, the
prefect, and their agents had been
bringing authority into disgrace, his
dull eye brightened, it is said, with a
flash of anger; he shrugged his
shoulders nervously, and a cloud of
deep displeasure passed over his
brow. He rang the bell impatiently.</p>

<p>"Take this to the telegraph office,"
said he.</p>

<p>It was a brief dispatch to the Prefect
of Tarbes, ordering him, in the
name of the Emperor, to rescind instantly
the decree closing the grotto
at Lourdes, and to leave the people
free.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>We are familiar with the discoveries
of science with regard to the wonderful
electric spark, which the network
of wires covering the globe carries
from one end of the earth to the
other in an instant. The telegraph,
as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savants</i> tell us, is the same
thing as the thunderbolt. On this
occasion, Baron Massy was entirely
of their opinion. The imperial despatch,
falling suddenly upon them,
stunned and bewildered him, as a
sudden stroke of lightning would
have done coming down upon his
house. He could not believe in its
reality. The more he thought of it,
the more impossible it seemed for
him to retrace his steps, to reverse
his judgment, or to bear his retreat
publicly. Nevertheless, he had to
swallow this bitter draught, or hand
in his resignation and put far away
from his lips the sweet prefectoral
cup. Fatal alternative! The heart
of a public functionary is sometimes
torn by fearful anguish.</p>

<p>When a sudden catastrophe comes
upon us, we have at first some difficulty
in accepting it as definitive,
and we continue to struggle after all
is lost. Baron Massy did not escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span>
this illusion. He hoped vaguely
that the Emperor would revoke
his decision. In this hope, he undertook
to keep the dispatch secret
for some days, and not to obey.
He wrote to the Emperor, and also
secured the intervention of Minister
Rouland, who was less publicly but
as completely affected as himself by
the unexpected order from Biarritz.</p>

<p>Napoleon III. was as insensible
to the protests of the minister as to
the representations and entreaties of
the prefect. The judgment which
he had made had been based upon
evidence, and was irrevocable. All
these steps had no other result than to
show him that the prefect had dared
to set aside his orders and to postpone
their execution. A second despatch
left Biarritz. It was couched
in terms which permitted no comment
or delay.</p>

<p>Baron Massy had to choose between
his pride and his prefecture.
He made the grievous choice, and
was humble enough to remain in his
office.</p>

<p>The head of the department resigned
himself to obedience. Nevertheless,
in spite of the imperative
orders of his master, he still tried,
not to resist, which was evidently
impossible, but to hide his retreat and
not surrender publicly.</p>

<p>In consequence of some official
indiscretions, and perhaps also by
the account of the gentlemen who
had waited on the Emperor, the purport
of the orders from Biarritz was
already vaguely known by the public.
It was the topic of general conversation.
The prefect neither confirmed
nor denied the prevailing rumors.
He instructed Jacomet and
his agents to draw up no more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbaux</i>,
and to discontinue the
watch. Such a course, coming in
connection with the current reports
as to the instructions of the Emperor,
ought to have sufficed (at least such
was his hope) to put things in their
normal state, and make the prohibitory
decree a dead letter. It was
even probable that the people, restored
to liberty, would hasten themselves
to root up and throw into the
Gave the posts bearing the caution
against entering upon the common
land and within the barriers which
enclosed the grotto.</p>

<p>M. Massy was, however, mistaken
in his calculations, plausible as they
may have been. In spite of the absence
of the police, in spite of the
reports which were circulating without
official contradiction, the people
feared some snare. They continued
to pray on the wrong side of the
Gave. The trespasses were as before,
generally speaking, few and far
between. No one touched the posts
or the barriers. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</i>, instead
of disappearing of its own accord,
as the prefect had hoped, obstinately
remained.</p>

<p>Considering the character of Napoleon
III., and the clearness of the
orders from Biarritz, the situation was
dangerous for the prefect, and Baron
Massy was too intelligent not to perceive
it. Every moment it was to be
feared that the Emperor would hear
of the way in which he was trying to
beat around the bush. He may well
have dreaded continually that some
terrible message would arrive setting
him aside for ever, and turning him
out in the cold, out from the luminous
realms of functionarism into the exterior
darkness in which the miserable
unofficial world is involved.</p>

<p>The end of September had come.</p>

<p>It happened that, during these perplexities,
M. Fould had occasion to
make another visit to Tarbes, and
even to go to Lourdes. Did he increase
the alarm of the prefect by
speaking of the sovereign, or did
the Baron receive some new telegram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
more crushing than the others? We
do not know. But it is certain that,
on the 3d of October, M. Massy, as
if struck down by some unseen hand,
became pliable as a broken reed, and
that his arrogant stiffness was suddenly
changed to a complete prostration.</p>

<p>The next day he issued, in the name
of the Emperor, an order to the mayor
of Lourdes to repeal the decree publicly,
and to have Jacomet remove
the posts and barriers.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>M. Lacadé did not hesitate like
M. Massy. This issue freed him at
once from the heavy burden which
the mingled desire of pleasing both
the prefect and the people, both the
heavenly and earthly powers, had
imposed upon him. By an illusion
very common with undecided people,
he imagined that he had always been
on the side which now prevailed, and
in this spirit he drew up a proclamation
to the following effect: "Citizens
of Lourdes, the day which we have so
earnestly desired has at last come;
we have earned it by our wisdom,
perseverance, faith, and courage."
Such was the sense and style of his
proclamation, the text of which is
unfortunately not extant.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>The proclamation was read through
the town, with an accompaniment of
drums and trumpets. At the same
time the following notice was posted
on the walls:</p>


<p class="center">The Mayor of Lourdes,<br />
Acting upon instructions addressed to
him,</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Orders As Follows</span>:</p>

<p class="center">The order issued on the 8th of June, 1858,
is revoked.</p>

<p class="center">Done at Lourdes, at the Mayor's Office,
Oct. 5, 1858.</p>


<p class="signature">The Mayor, <span class="smcap">A. Lacadé</span>.</p>


<p>At the same time, Jacomet and the
sergents-de-ville repaired to the grotto
to take away the barriers and posts.</p>

<p>A crowd had already collected
there, and was increasing every moment.
Some were praying on their
knees, and, endeavoring not to be
distracted by the hubbub around,
were thanking God for having put a
stop to the scandal and the persecutions.
Others were standing up talking
in a low voice, and awaiting with
emotion what was about to take place.
Many of the women were saying their
beads. Some held bottles in their
hands, which they wished to fill at
the source of the fountain. Some
were throwing flowers over the barriers
into the interior of the grotto.
But no one touched the barriers. It
was necessary that those who had
publicly placed them there in opposition
to the power of God should
come and remove them publicly in
submission to the will of a man.</p>

<p>Jacomet arrived. Although, in spite
of himself, he showed some embarrassment,
and though from the paleness
of his face his profound humiliation
might have been suspected, still he
had not, contrary to the general expectation,
the dejected appearance
of one who had been conquered.
Escorted by his subordinates with
their hatchets and pickaxes, he came
forward with a bold face. With a
seemingly strange affectation, he wore
his full-dress costume. His large
tricolor scarf was wrapped around
him and rested upon his parade
sword. A vague tumult, a dull murmur,
with some distinct cries here
and there, was heard from the crowd.
The commissary took up his position
upon a rock, and signed to the people
that he wished to speak. Every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[541]</a></span>
listened. His words are said to have
been to this effect: "My friends, these
barriers which the municipality, to my
great regret, has ordered to put up,
are about to be removed. Who has
suffered more than I from this obstacle
raised against your piety? I also am
a Christian, my friends; I share your
faith. But the official, like the soldier,
has only one duty; it is the duty,
often a very painful one, of obedience.
The responsibility does not rest upon
him. Well, my friends, when I saw
your admirable patience, your respect
for authority, your persevering faith,
I informed the higher authorities. I
pleaded your cause. I said, 'Why
prevent them from praying at the
grotto, from drinking at the fountain?
They will do no harm.' And thus,
my friends, the prohibition has been
removed, and the prefect and I have
resolved to take down these barriers
for ever, which were so displeasing to
you and much more so to me."</p>

<p>The crowd maintained a cold
silence. Some of the young people
chuckled and laughed. Jacomet was
evidently troubled by his want of success.
He gave orders to his men to
take away the fence, which was done
without delay. The boards were
piled up near the grotto, and the
police came at nightfall to take them
away.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing at Lourdes.
All the afternoon crowds were
going and coming on the road to the
grotto. Before the Massabielle rocks
immense numbers of the faithful were
kneeling. Canticles and litanies were
sung: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virgo potens, ora pro nobis</span>."
The people drank of the fountain.
Faith was free. God had triumphed.</p>

<h2>MR. FROUDE AND CALVINISM.</h2>


<p>The Robert-Houdin of modern
English writers, and author of that
popular serial novel grimly entitled
<cite>The History of England</cite>, appears
to be only at home in an element of
paradox, and in the clever accomplishment
of some literary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tour de
force</i>. <i>Calvinism:</i> An Address delivered
at St. Andrews, March 17,
1871, by James Anthony Froude,
M.A.,<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> is his latest performance.</p>

<p>Always liberal in his assumption
of premises, no one need be surprised
that the author should claim Calvinism
to have been "accepted for two
centuries in all Protestant countries
as the final account of the relations
between man and his Maker," and
should represent that "the Catholics
whom it overthrew" assail it, etc.
It will be news to most Protestants,
Lutherans and Anglicans in particular,
that Calvinism was thus accepted,
and the 'overthrown Catholics'
will be not less surprised. Throughout
the address, Mr. Froude industriously
insists upon the false idea
that Luther was a Calvinist. The
statement refutes itself in its terms.
No argument is needed to show that
Luther's free-will doctrine and Calvin's
predestination were simply irreconcilable.
It was not skilful in
Mr. Froude to smother in its very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>birth his labored vindication of Calvinistic
doctrine by such a presentation
as this (p. 4):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has come to be regarded by liberal
thinkers as a system of belief incredible
in itself, dishonoring to its object,
and as intolerable as it has been
itself intolerant. To represent man as
sent into the world under a curse, as
incurably wicked&mdash;wicked by the constitution
of his flesh, and wicked by
eternal decree&mdash;as doomed, unless exempted
by special grace which he cannot
merit or by any effort of his own obtain,
to live in sin while he remains on earth,
and to be eternally miserable when he
leaves it&mdash;to represent him as born
unable to keep the commandments, yet
as justly liable to everlasting punishment
for breaking them, is alike repugnant to
reason and to conscience, and turns existence
into a hideous nightmare. To
tell men that they cannot help themselves
is to fling them into recklessness and
despair. To what purpose the effort to
be virtuous, when it is an effort which is
foredoomed to fail&mdash;when those that are
saved are saved by no effort of their own,
and confess themselves the worst of sinners,
even when rescued from the penalties
of sin; and those that are lost are
lost by an everlasting sentence decreed
against them before they were born?
How are we to call the Ruler who laid
us under this iron code by the name of
Wise, or Just, or Merciful, when we
ascribe principles of action to him
which in a human father we should call
preposterous and monstrous?"</p></blockquote>

<p>As types of Calvinism and almost
perfect human beings, as men of
grandeur and nobility of character,
upright life, commanding intellect,
untainted selfishness, unalterably just,
frank, true, cheerful, humorous, and
as unlike sour fanatics as it is possible
to imagine any one, Mr. Froude
names William the Silent, Luther,
John Knox, Andrew Melville, the
Regent Murray, Coligny, Cromwell,
Milton, and John Bunyan. The
Calvinism of all the members of this
remarkably assorted group is at least
open to serious question. As to
their supereminent goodness and
almost angelic purity, it would be an
easy but not a pleasant task to point
out the refutation in their fatal shortcomings.
It may be that Cromwell
had "the tenderness of a woman" in
his heart, but no testimony to support
that assertion could possibly be procured
in Ireland. It may be that
Knox was not a sour fanatic, that
William was all unselfishness, that
Coligny was blameless, and that
Milton's wife was mistaken in her
estimate of her husband.</p>

<p>As to the Regent Murray, who
was told to his face by John Knox
that his religion was "for his own
commoditie," and whom Aytoun<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
has incarcerated in the immortal
amber of his verse as "the falsest
villain ever Scotland bred"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"False to his faith, a wedded priest:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still falser to the Crown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False to the blood, that in his veins<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Made bastardy renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False to his sister, whom he swore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To guard and shield from harm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The head of many a felon plot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But never once the arm!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A verier knave ne'er stepped the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since this wide world began;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet&mdash;he bandies texts with Knox,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And walks a pious man!"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>we are perfectly satisfied that
Robespierre is an accomplished
Christian gentleman beside him, for
Robespierre at least never stole his
sister's jewels nor took bribes from
his country's enemies.</p>

<p>Then we are treated by the author
to a promenade down the path of
ages, amid the wrecks of empires
and of systems, and to rhetorically
embroidered sketches, with mention
more or less extended of Olympus,
Valhalla, Egyptian idolatry, Buddhism,
in which "Zoroaster, like
Moses, saw behind the physical
forces into the deeper laws of right
and wrong," Greek theology, the
Stoics, "the Galilean fishermen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>and the tentmaker of Tarsus," and&mdash;Islamism.
Of all these, the last
most decidedly brings out Mr.
Froude's warmest enthusiasm, and
we find ourselves querying if it is
Mohammed's fatalism he so much admires,
for the monotheism of the
prophet could hardly be called
Calvinistic, thus making the burning
of Servetus a gratuitous waste of
cord-wood. Here we feel bound in
justice to say that, although the men
of Galilee and of Tarsus do not
appear to excite any very strong
admiration in our author, he nevertheless
makes the handsome concession
that he is not "upholding
Mohammed as if he had been a perfect
man, or the Koran as a second
Bible," and that "the detailed conception
of man's duties was inferior,
far inferior, to what St. Martin and
St. Patrick, St. Columba and St.
Augustine, were teaching or had
taught in Western Europe."</p>

<p>The early Christian church being
essentially Catholic, it does not draw
very heavily on either Mr. Froude's
enthusiasm or his admiration, and, in
speaking of "the mystery called transubstantiation"
in the twelfth century,
he makes an attempt to sum up Catholicity
in a vein partaking of the
brutality with which, in his <cite>History
of England</cite>, he has the cool insolence
to speak of the Catholic religion&mdash;the
religion of Copernicus, Sir Thomas
More, Fénelon, and Dr. Newman&mdash;as
"a Paphian idolatry."</p>

<p>The Reformation is, of course, introduced
with flourish of trumpets.
But the Reformation was essentially
Lutheran, and not Calvinistic. Luther
himself, who was, so Mr. Froude
assures us, "one of the grandest men
that ever lived on earth," than whom
"none more loyal to the light that
was in him&mdash;braver, truer, or wider-minded,
in the noblest sense of the
word"&mdash;this Luther, we say, was as
sincere a believer as Saint Augustine
in the real presence&mdash;in transubstantiation,
as Mr. Froude has it&mdash;a doctrine
which, on all occasions and as
far as in him lies, our English writer
seeks to drag in the mud. And yet
this Luther, so believing, was, Mr.
Froude seeks to persuade us, a Calvinist.</p>

<p>Calvinism, in practice, was a lovely
thing, and Mr. Froude proves that it
was by&mdash;John Knox, whom he thus
cites: "Elsewhere," says Knox, speaking
of Geneva, "the word of God is
taught as purely; but never anywhere
have I seen God obeyed as faithfully."</p>

<p>Mr. Froude is, moreover, surprised
that Calvinism should have been
called intolerant,<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and sums up its
vindication thus: "Intolerance of an
enemy who is trying to kill you seems
to me a pardonable state of mind."</p>

<p>In the face of this citation, it is almost
unnecessary to state that the
name of Servetus does not once occur
in the forty-seven pages of the
<i>Address</i>, nor is the slightest allusion
made to him. And if the curious
reader, unacquainted with the practical
working of Calvinism in Geneva,
where God was "obeyed so faithfully,"
should inquire how it was that
this perfect Christian man, Calvin,
wrote his laws in blood and enforced
them with the aid of executioners and
torturers; how it was that he persecuted
some men and, under color of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>law, assassinated others, he may be
referred to these witnesses: <i>First</i>.
Jerome Bolsec, exiled for proposing
"an opinion false and contrary to the
evangelical religion." <i>Second.</i> Peter
Arneaux, who, for saying that Calvin
was "a wicked man announcing false
doctrine," was condemned to walk
the streets of Geneva in his shirt, a
lighted torch in his hand, bare-headed
and bare-footed. <i>Third.</i> Henri
de la Marc, exiled for saying that
Peter Arneaux was a worthy man,
and that, if Calvin had a spite against
any one, he gratified it. <i>Fourth.</i>
Jacques Gruet, who was beheaded
and his head afterward nailed to a
post, for the crime of being the
author of placards accusing the Calvinists
of persecution, and for proofs
of impiety found in his private writings
when his house was searched.
<i>Finally.</i> Servetus, who, for being "a
sower of heresies," was, by Calvin's
authority, imprisoned, left there for
two months to suffer by hunger and
nakedness, and then brought out and,
at the age of forty-four years, burned
alive.</p>

<p>We cannot be certain that Mr.
Froude has ever heard of any of
these Protestants martyred for their
opinions. If he has heard of them,
we presume he means to vindicate
Calvin, and to cover their cases by
the crushing statement at page
43: "It is no easy matter to tolerate
lies clearly convicted of being
lies under any circumstances; specially
it is not easy to tolerate lies which
strut about in the name of religion."</p>

<p>The passage is characteristic of
Mr. Froude's capacity for ambiguity
and indirection, but he neglects to
indicate the tribunal of truth at
which these lies are "clearly convicted."
It is a serious matter for a
gentleman of no particular religious
principle to say that this or the other
theological conviction is a lie
which struts about in the name of
religion; for, in the eye of the theologically
convicted, the most offensively
disgusting of all struts is the strut
of "no religion to speak of." Moreover,
the author had better have left
unpublished the last member of the
sentence we have quoted, because,
in his case, it irresistibly suggests this
other phrase: "It is not easy to tolerate
novels which strut about in the
name of history."</p>

<p>Thus we know, as matter of record,
that Norman Leslie proposed
to Henry VIII. the assassination of
Cardinal Beaton for a sum of money,
that the negotiation, at first delayed,
was finally closed and carried out.
Leslie got his money, and the cardinal
was murdered, because, as Mr.
Froude touchingly relates it, Henry's
position "obliged him to look at
facts as they were rather than through
conventional forms."</p>

<p>Mr. Froude presents the hired bravo
of Henry VIII. thus: "Norman
Leslie did not kill Cardinal Beaton
down in the castle yonder because
he was a Catholic, but because he
was a murderer."</p>

<p>Mr. Froude does not appear by
his writings to have an unvarying
standard of morality. Apparently
incapable of judging actions as they
are, he measures them by his personal
like or dislike of the actors. Always
the advocate, never the philosophical
historian, he presents but
one side of a case. Certain personages
in history are with him always
right, certain others are always wrong.
Even the crimes of the former are
meritorious, or, at worse, indifferent,
while the indifferent sayings and doings
of the latter are sins of deepest
die. We may see this tendency exemplified
in the address before us
which seeks to make Calvinism
lovely.</p>

<p>The author says, in plain terms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
that it was not more criminal in a
Calvinist to burn a witch than for
any other person to invite a spirit-rapper
to dinner.</p>

<p>Of course he expresses the opinion
euphuistically and in mellifluous
phrase, but, nevertheless, he does
express it. And that our readers
may fully understand that we do not
even unintentionally misrepresent
him, we give his words. At page
43, we read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In burning witches, the Calvinists followed
their model too exactly; but it is
to be remembered that they really believed
those poor creatures to have made
a compact with Satan. And, as regards
morality, it may be doubted whether inviting
spirit-rappers to dinner, and allowing
them to pretend to consult our dead
relations, is very much more innocent.
The first method is but excess of indignation
with evil; the second is complacent
toying with it."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is worth while to notice how
deftly Mr. Froude handles his positive
and comparative.</p>

<p>For Calvinists to burn people alive
is <i>innocent</i>, and intercourse with spirit-rappers
is <i>not very much more innocent</i>.</p>

<p>With such juggling as this of facts
and phrases, the author of Calvinism
has written his <cite>History of England</cite>,
the delight of circulating library subscribers
because it is "as interesting
as a novel."</p>

<p>And so it is, for the best of reasons.</p>

<p>In reading the lives of the saints,
I have been particularly struck with
their love for, and their power over,
the animal world. They seemed to
live nearer the heart of nature than
other mortals, and perceived there
diviner harmonies. Perhaps this
sympathetic relation sprang from the
belief that, as the whole natural,
world participated in the fall of man,
so it has its part in the fruit of our
Saviour's Passion. At least, they believed
that animals, in common with
man, received life from God and exist
through him. "All creatures,"
says Denis the Carthusian, "partake
of the divine, eternal, and uncreated
beauty." The saints respected in
animals that divine wisdom which
Albertus Magnus tells us, in his book
on animals, is to be recognized in
their instinct. Dr. Newman says:
"Men of narrow reasoning may
smile at the supposition that the
woods and wild animals can fall
into the scheme of theology and
preach to the heart the all-pervading
principles of religion; but they
forget that God's works have a unity
of design throughout, and that the
author of nature and of revealed religion
is one."</p>

<p>Dr. Faber saw throughout creation
a threefold manifestation of God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
typifying his being, the generation of
the Son, and the procession of the
Spirit.</p>

<p>Sanctity seems to restore man to
his primeval relation to nature, and
give him back the power he possessed
in Eden over the animal world. The
Holy Scriptures tell us of beasts and
birds sent to minister to the wants of
man, and how the very lions reverenced
the prophet Daniel. Animals
were submissive to man before his
fall, and they went obediently into
the ark at the command of Noah.
Such things are renewed and repeated
in the lives of the Christian saints.
It is not more wonderful that a raven
should bring St. Paul the Hermit
half a loaf every day for sixty years,
and a whole one when visited by St.
Anthony, than that one should feed
the prophet. St. Gregory of Nazianzen
relates that St. Basil's grandmother,
St. Macrina, having taken refuge with
her husband in the forests of Pontus
during a persecution, was miraculously
fed by stags. St. Bega, when
a hermitess in a cave on the Cumberland
coast, lived in supernatural
familiarity with the sea-birds and the
wolves of Copeland forest, and they
in part supplied her with food. St.
Roch is usually represented with the
dog that used to accompany him in
his pilgrimages. When St. Roch
had the plague, the dog went daily
into the city and returned with a
loaf of bread for his master.</p>

<p>Among the old legends that embody
the popular idea of the veneration
of the animal world for holiness,
is that of the Flight into Egypt. It
is said the lions and leopards crept
out of their lairs to lick the baby
hands of the infant Jesus. When
Christians, in the times of persecution
under the Roman emperors,
were thrown to the wild beasts in
the amphitheatre, there are many
examples of these usually ferocious
animals refusing to touch the holy
victims, as in the well-known instances
of Andronicus and Tarchus.</p>

<p>St. Blaise is depicted surrounded
by a variety of animals, such as the
lion and the lamb, the leopard and
the hind, who seem to have laid aside
their animosity. This saint was obliged,
in the persecution of the reign of
Diocletian, to take refuge in a cave
of the mountains. It was the haunt
of wild beasts, whose ferocity he so
disarmed that they came every morning,
as if to ask his blessing, says the
old legend. One day, he met an old
woman in distress for the loss of her
only earthly possession, a pig, which
had been carried off by a wolf. Such
power had St. Blaise over the animal
world, that when he ordered the wolf
to bring back the pig he obeyed.</p>

<p>Some time after, the woman killed
her pig and took a part of it to St.
Blaise, who had been thrown into
prison and left without any food,
thereby preventing him from starving.</p>

<p>St. Jerome is represented, in Christian
art, with the lion he healed, and
which remained with him. The legend
tells us the saint made the lion
guard the ass that brought his fagots
from the forest. One day, the lion
went to sleep in the woods, and the
ass was stolen. The lion returned
home with drooping head, as if
ashamed. St. Jerome made him
bring the fagots in place of the ass,
which he did till he discovered his
old friend in a caravan of merchants,
whom he so terrified that they confessed
their sin to St. Jerome and
restored the ass.</p>

<p>There is a very similar legend of
the Abbot Gerasimus, who lived
near the river Jordan.</p>

<p>We are told, in the lives of the
fathers of the desert, of one of them
who was carrying provisions across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
the desert to his brethren. Wearied
with his burden and the long journey,
he called to a wild ass he espied to
come and aid him, for the love of
Christ. The ass hastened to his assistance,
and bore the father and his
load to the cells of his brethren.</p>

<p>St. Aphraates dispersed the army
of locusts that threatened the country
around Antioch.</p>

<p>St. Martin commanded the serpents,
and they obeyed him.</p>

<p>And we read how the wolf-hounds,
hungry and fierce, that were kept for
the chase, respected St. Walburga
when she went, late at night, to visit
the dying daughter of a neighboring
baron.</p>

<p>It would almost seem as if these
animals recognized, as an able writer
says, the presence of Him who lulled
the tempest with a word in the souls
in whom he dwells.</p>

<p>Tradition records the fondness of
one of the twelve apostles&mdash;the loved
apostle John&mdash;for animals. Every
one has heard of the tame partridge
he took pleasure in feeding. He was
seen tending his bird by a passing
hunter, who expressed his surprise to
see the apostle, so renowned for his
age and sanctity, thus employing his
time. St. John asked him if he always
kept his bow bent. "That
would soon render it useless," said the
hunter. "So do I unbend my mind
in this way for the same reason you
unbend your bow&mdash;to prevent its becoming
useless." Perhaps he derived
his love for animals from his ancestress
Rebecca, who showed the kindness
of her nature in offering to water
the camels of the stranger. Eliezer
saw it, and began wooing her for his
master's son.</p>

<p>There are numerous instances in
which animals instinctively betook
themselves to the saints for protection.
A hind, pursued by dogs, took
refuge with St. Giles in his cave near
the mouth of the Rhone. The hunters,
following on his track, found the
wounded beast crouching beside the
saint, who protected him. The hind
remained with St. Giles, who fed on
his milk. This saint is represented
in paintings with the animal beside
him. "Ane hind set up beside Sanct
Geill," says Sir David Lindsay.</p>

<p>There is a similar legend about St.
Procopius, a hermit, with whom a
hunted hind took refuge.</p>

<p>As St. Anselm was riding to the
Manor of Herse, a hare, pursued by
hunters, sought shelter under the
housings of his mule. St. Anselm
wept, but the foresters laughed, and
the hounds stood around at bay. The
saint said: "This poor hare reminds
me of the soul of a sinner beset by
fiends eager to seize their prey." He
ordered the hunters not to pursue the
hare, which fled.</p>

<p>So a deer took refuge from hunters
in the cell of St. Aventin, a hermit
who lived on an island in the Seine.
One night a bear attacked his hut
with furious cries. The saint betook
himself to prayer, and at dawn found
the animal, subdued and gentle, lying
at his door licking his paw. The saint
saw it was pierced by a thorn, and
drew it out, when the beast went
quietly away into the forest. When
a person, who lived for a time with
St. Aventin, caught some fish, the
saint threw them back into the river,
saying: "Go, little creatures, return
to your element and food and remain
there at liberty: my element and
food are Jesus Christ, to whom I wish
to return, that in him I may live for
ever."</p>

<p>St. Bartholomew, a hermit of Farne,
was so gentle in his movements that
the wild sea-birds were not afraid of
him. He allowed no one to molest
them. He tamed an eider-duck,
which daily fed out of his hand.
One day, as St. Bartholomew was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
sitting on the sea-shore, a cormorant
pulled the edge of his garment with
its bill. He followed the bird, and
found its young had fallen into a fissure
in the rocks. He rescued them
from danger.</p>

<p>St. Helier, a hermit in the isle of
Jersey, lived for years on a barren
crag overlooking the sea. Attention
was called to the place of his retreat
by the flight of the birds who shared
the rock with him, and he was beheaded
by his pagan discoverers.</p>

<p>The marine animals would fawn
on St. Cuthbert while he was praying
by night on the island of Farne.
The eider-ducks are called by the islanders
to this day "St. Cuthbert's
ducks."</p>

<p>So the nuns of Whitby "exulting
told"</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"How sea-fowls' pinions fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As over Whitby's towers they sail,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>St. Serf, an old Scottish monk, had
a pet ram which he had raised and
used to follow him about. The laird
of Tillicoultry stole the animal and
"ate him up in pieces small." Being
accused of the theft, the laird declared
on oath that he had neither stolen
nor eaten the ram. Whereupon, so
runs the old legend, the ram "bleated
in his wayme"! The saint predicted
that no heir born to the estate
of Tillicoultry should succeed to his
patrimony, which prediction has been
verified down to our own time.
During the last two centuries Tillicoultry
has been in the possession of
thirteen different families, and in no
case has the heir born to it become
the owner. Lord Colville, a distinguished
soldier of the time of James
VI., retired to his estate of Tillicoultry
to spend the rest of his life in
retirement. Walking on the terrace
one day, he slipped while looking up
at an old hawthorn tree, and fell down
the bank and was instantly killed.
The estate was afterwards sold to the
Earl of Stirling, at whose death it
was sold to Sir Alexander Rollo, and
so it has passed from one family to
another down to our time. In 1837,
it was bought by Mr. Stirling, who
was accidentally killed. His brother,
not the born heir, succeeded him, but
sold it in 1842 to Mr. Anstruther, who
in turn sold it to his brother, the present
proprietor.</p>

<p>St. Richard, Bishop of Winchester,
through excessive tenderness for the
animal world, hardly ever ate any
meat. When he saw any lamb or
chicken on his table, he used to say:
"We are the cause of your death, ye
innocent ones. What have ye done
worthy of death?" He thought as
Frederick Schlegel, who remarks:
"The sorrows of beasts are certainly
a theme for the meditations of men,
and I could not agree to the justice
of regarding it as a subject unworthy
of reflection, or of permitting sympathy
with them to be banished from
the human breast." St. Richard's
love extended to the whole natural
world. In the time of his troubles
he used to retire to the parsonage of
a country curate, not far from Winchester,
to find solace in communion
with nature. His friend loved to
look at him walking in the garden
watching the unfolding of the flower-buds
or amusing himself by budding
and grafting, forgetful of the wrath
of the king and the number of his
enemies. A graft which the owner
regarded with great pride having
died, Richard regrafted it. It lived
and bore fruit.</p>

<p>Many stories are told of the love
of St. Waltheof, Abbot of Melrose,
for animals, and, in particular, of his
affection for the old gray horse which
he constantly rode, and used playfully
to call Brother Grizzle (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Frater Ferrandus</i>).
He was even known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
discipline himself for having killed an
insect, saying he had taken away the
life of one of God's creatures which
he could not restore. His gray horse
was well known in the valley of the
Tweed. The humble abbot rode him,
with his own luggage and that of his
few attendants slung on before him,
including the boots of his groom.
He appeared before his kinsman, the
King of Scotland, in this array.
Waltheof's brother was ashamed of
him, but the king was so edified that
he knelt to ask the abbot's blessing,
and granted him all his petitions,
saying: "This man hath put all
worldly things under his feet, but we
are running after this fleeting world,
losing soul and body in the pursuit."</p>

<p>Sophronius, writing in a more remote
age, says: "Going to New
Alexandria, we found Abbot John,
who had spent eighty years in that
monastery, so full of charity that he
was pitiful also to brute animals.
Early in the morning he used to give
food to all the dogs that were in the
monastery, and would even bring
grain to the ants and the birds on the
roof."</p>

<p>And, at a later day again, at Citeaux
a great number of storks built
their nests around the abbey, and, on
going away for the winter, would
hover over the monks working in the
fields, as if to ask their blessing, which
was given them.</p>

<p>We are told in the annals of Corby
that the novices had an otter
which they kept for a long time in
the refectory. And the success of
Friar Baddo in training a dog is
spoken of.</p>

<p>There was a peculiar breed of
black dogs in the Abbey of St. Hubert
in the Ardennes, called the dogs
of St. Hubert.</p>

<p>The birds of Croyland would feed
from the hands of St. Guthlac, the
hermit, and alight on his head and
shoulders, and the fish would come
up out of the water for the food he
gave them.</p>

<p>So a white swan was for fifteen
years in the habit of coming up from
the marshes and flying around St.
Hugh of Lincoln, and then alighting
to eat from his hand, sometimes
thrusting its bill into his bosom.
This swan survived the saint many
years, but, after his death, returned
to its old wild habits, avoiding all
human beings.</p>

<p>St. Columba used to feed the sea-beaten
herons that alighted on the
island of Iona.</p>

<p>The sparrows would descend and
eat out of St. Remi's hand.</p>

<p>And the birds would hover around
the hermits of Montserrat and eat
from their hands.</p>

<p>Hugo of St. Victor shows his familiarity
with the habits of animals
by his allusions to them in his instructions.</p>

<p>Digby relates that in 1507 there
was a lamb in the convent of Muri
that used to go to the choir at the
sound of the bell and remain during
the chanting of the divine office.
When the matin bell rang, it would
run around the corridors and knock
its head against the door of each cell
till it had roused the inmate, and, on
going to the choir, if it saw one vacant
stall, it would return to the dormitory
and bleat for the missing one.</p>

<p>St. Philip Neri could not bear to
witness the slightest cruelty to animals,
and would caution the coachman
not to run over one. And
even wild animals would respond to
his tenderness by their familiarity
with him, and dogs would leave
their masters to follow him. Seeing
one of his congregation tread on a
lizard as he was passing through the
court, St. Philip said to him: "Cruel
fellow, what has that poor little animal
done to you?" He was greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
agitated at seeing a butcher wound
a dog with his knife. A boy having
brought him a bird, St. Philip through
pity ordered it to be let out at the
window. Shortly after, he expressed
regret for having given the
bird its freedom, for fear it might die
of hunger. Louis, one of his young
penitents, had two little birds which
he gave St. Philip. He accepted
them on condition the giver would
come every day to see after them,
wishing to exert a good influence
over the youth. One day Louis
came and found the saint ill in bed,
and one of the birds perched on his
face. It then fluttered around his
head, singing very sweetly. St. Philip
asked Louis if he had accustomed
the bird to do so. Louis replied in
the negative. St. Philip tried in vain
to drive the bird away, and finally
had the cage brought, when it went
in as if through obedience.</p>

<p>Father Pietro Consolini, of the Oratory,
tells a curious story of a good
brother who worked in the kitchen.
In order to satisfy his devotion for
the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, he
would put a cat upon the kitchen table,
and order it to keep watch while
he was absent. Then he would go
off to church with a peculiar confidence
in God. The cat, as if remembering
the submission due to
man in his primitive state of innocence,
used to mount the table as
desired, and remain there, as if on
guard, till the good brother returned.</p>

<p>St. Anthony of Padua also was
full of love for animals, as well as of
nature in general, as he showed by
constant allusions in his sermons.
He was always dwelling with delight
upon the whiteness and gentleness
of the swans, the mutual charity of
the storks, the purity and fragrance
of the flowers of the fields,
etc., etc. When preaching once to
sinners who refused to listen to him,
he suddenly turned away from them,
and, appealing to the animal world,
asked the fish of the water to hearken
to him. The old legend tells how
they lifted their heads in great numbers
from the water to listen to his
words.</p>

<p>St. Bernard would deliver the bird
from the snare of the fowler, and the
wild hare from the hounds.</p>

<p>St. Ignatius Loyola admired the
beauty, wisdom, and power of the
Creator in his creatures. He was
often rapt in contemplation before
an insect, a flower, or a blade of
grass.</p>

<p>St. Francis de Sales so constantly
manifests an extraordinary love of nature
in his writings that they have been
compared to the sacred veil of Isis,
on which was embroidered all created
things. Here is an extract taken
at random from his writings, which
lose their rare <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouquet</i> in translating:</p>

<p>"It had been snowing, and there
was in the court, at least, a foot of
snow. Jean swept a small space in
the centre, and scattered grain on
the ground for the pigeons to eat.
They came in a flock to take their
food there with wonderful peace and
quietness, and I amused myself with
looking at them. You cannot imagine
how much these little creatures
edified me. They did not utter a
sound, and those who had finished
their meal immediately made room
for others, and flew a short distance
to see them eat. When the place
was partly vacated, a quantity of
birdlings that had been surveying
them came up, and the pigeons that
were still eating drew up in one corner
to leave the more space for the
little birds, who forthwith began to
eat. The pigeons did not molest
them.</p>

<p>"I admired their charity, for the
pigeons were so afraid of annoying
the little birds that they crowded together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
at one end of their table. I
admired, too, the discretion of the little
mendicants, who only asked alms
when they saw the pigeons were
nearly through their meal, and that
there was enough left. Altogether,
I could not help shedding tears to
see the charitable simplicity of the
doves, and the confidence of the little
birds in their charity. I do not
know that a sermon would have affected
me so keenly. This little picture
of kindness did me good the
whole day."</p>

<p>And again, in writing to Madame
de Chantal on the repose of
the heart on the divine will, he
says:</p>

<p>"I was thinking the other day of
what I had read of the halcyon, a
little bird that lays on the sea-shore.
They make their nests perfectly round,
and so compact that the water of the
sea cannot penetrate them. Only on
the top there is a little hole through
which they can breathe. There they
lodge their little ones, so if the sea
rises suddenly, they can float upon
the waves with no fear of being wet
or submerged. The air which enters
by the little hole serves as a counterpoise,
and so balances these little
cushions, these little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barquettes</i>, that
they are never overturned."</p>

<p>There is in the Louvre a charming
little picture by Giotto of St. Francis
preaching to the birds. The
saint's face, with an earnest, loving
expression, is looking up at the birds,
that, with outstretched necks and
half-open beaks, appear to catch his
words. The old legend which this
painting illustrates with all the artist's
vividness in presenting a story, is
equally charming in its simplicity.
It is as follows: As St. Francis was
going toward Bivagno, he lifted up
his eyes and saw a multitude of
birds. He said to his companions:
Wait for me here while I preach to
my little sisters the birds. The
birds all gathered around him, and
he spoke to them somewhat as follows:
"My little sisters the birds, you
owe much to God your Creator,
and ought to sing his praise at all
times and in all places, because he
has given you liberty, and the air to
fly about in, and, though you neither
spin nor sew, he has given you a
covering for yourselves and your little
ones. He sent two of your
species into the ark with Noah that
you might not be lost to the world.
He feeds you, though you neither
sow nor reap. He has given you
fountains and rivers in which to
quench your thirst, and trees in which
to build your nests. Beware, my little
sisters, of the sin of ingratitude,
and study always to praise the Lord."</p>

<p>As he preached, the birds opened
their beaks, and stretched out their
necks, and flapped their wings, and
bowed their heads toward the earth.</p>

<p>His sermon over, St. Francis made
the sign of the cross, and the birds
flew up into the air, singing sweetly
their song of praise, and dispersed
toward the four quarters of the world,
as if to convey the words they had
heard to all the world.</p>

<p>The sympathy of St. Francis of
Assisi with nature, both animate and
inanimate, is well known. He has
been styled the Orpheus of the middle
ages. Like the Psalmist, he called
upon all nature to praise the
Lord: "Praise the Lord from the
earth, ye dragons and all ye deeps;
fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy winds
which fulfil his word, mountains
and all hills, fruitful trees and all cedars,
beasts and all cattle, serpents
and all feathered fowls."</p>

<p>The very sight of a bird incited
St. Francis to lift his soul to God on
the wings of prayer. Crossing the
lagunes of Venice on his way from
Syria, he heard the birds singing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
said to his companions: "Let us go
and say the divine office in the midst
of our brethren the birds, who are
praising God." But finding they diverted
his attention from his office,
he said: "My brethren the birds,
cease your song till we have fulfilled
our obligations to God." The birds
ceased their song till the saint gave
them permission to resume it.</p>

<p>Preaching in the open air, in the
environs of Alviano, St. Francis could
not make himself heard on account
of the number of swallows. He
stopped and addressed them: "My
sisters the swallows, you have spoken
long enough. It is only right
that I should have my turn. Listen
to the word of God while I am
preaching."</p>

<p>Meeting a young man who had
caught a number of doves, he looked
on them with eyes of pity, and said:
"O good young man! I entreat thee
to give me those harmless birds, the
scriptural emblems of pure, humble,
and faithful souls, so they may not
fall into cruel hands and be put to
death." The young man gave them
to St. Francis, who put them in his bosom,
and said to them in the sweetest
of accents: "O my little sisters the
doves! so simple, so innocent, and so
chaste, why did you allow yourselves
to be caught?" He made nests for
them in the convent, where they laid
and hatched their young, and became
as tame as hens among the friars.</p>

<p>St. Francis was often seen employed
in removing worms from the road
that they might not be trampled on
by travellers, remembering that our
Divine Redeemer compared himself
to a worm, and also having compassion
on a creature of God.</p>

<p>He revered the very stones he trod
on, so that he sometimes trembled
in walking over them, recalling him
who is the chief corner-stone of the
spiritual edifice.</p>

<p>He wished the brothers when they
cut wood in the forest to leave some
shoots in memory of Him who wished
to die for us upon the wood of
the cross.</p>

<p>A flower reminded him of the rod
of Jesse which budded and blossomed,
and whose perfume is diffused
throughout the world.</p>

<p>He sometimes wished he were one
of the rulers of the land, that at
Christmas he might scatter grain by
the wayside and in the fields, that
the birds also might have occasion
to rejoice on that festival of joy.</p>

<p>Before his death, St. Francis made
a great feast at Christmas, to which
he invited the animals. He prepared
a manger in the woods, in which
there was straw, an ox, and an ass.
A long procession of friars, followed
by a crowd of people bearing torches
and chanting hymns, descended
the mountain. Mass was offered,
and St. Francis preached on the birth
of Christ, after which, filled with a
holy joy, he went through the fields
bursting forth into a hymn, calling
upon the vines, the trees, the flowers
of the field, the stars of heaven,
and the sun, and all his brethren and
sisters throughout nature, to rejoice
with him, and to unite with him in
blessing their Creator.</p>

<p>A wolf ravaged the environs of Agobio
to the great terror of the people.
St. Francis went forth armed with
the sign of the cross, and commanded
his brother the wolf, in the name
of Christ, to do no more harm. The
wolf, that was making furiously at
the saint with distended jaws, stopped
short, and lay down meek as a lamb
at his feet. Then St. Francis laid
before the wolf the enormity of his
offence in devouring men made in
the image of God, and promised that
if he would henceforth abstain from
his ravages he should be fed daily
by the inhabitants. The wolf signified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[553]</a></span>
his assent to the arrangement
by placing his paw in that of St.
Francis. Then the saint took the
wolf to the market-place, and made
known to the people the compact he
had made. They ratified the agreement
to feed the wolf daily till the
end of his days, and for two years
he went from door to door to get his
food, harming no one, at the end of
which time he died, greatly to the
sorrow of all.</p>

<p>Frederick Ozanam says in this legend,
which may provoke a smile:
"The animal that preys upon the
spoils and lives of men is the representative
of the people of the middle
ages, fierce and terrible when their
passions were excited, but never despaired
of by the church, who took
their blood-stained hands in her divine
ones, and gently led them on
till she succeeded in inspiring them
with a horror of rapine and violence."</p>

<p>St. Francis would salute in a friendly
manner the cattle in the pastures.
Once, seeing a lamb among the goats
and cattle, he was filled with pity,
and said to his brethren, "So was
our sweet Saviour in the midst of
the Pharisees and Sadducees." A merchant
that happened along bought
the lamb and gave it to St. Francis.
It was confided to some nuns, who
carefully tended it, and of its wool
spun and wove a garment for the
saint, who often kissed it tenderly
and showed it to his friends. Going
to Rome, St. Francis took the lamb
with him and, when he left, gave it
to a pious lady. The lamb followed
her everywhere, even to church. If
she did not rise early enough in the
morning, he would strike his head
against her bed till he roused her.</p>

<p>St. Francis would weep if he saw
a lamb about to be killed, recalling
Him who was led as a sheep to the
slaughter, and would sell his very
garments to save it from death.</p>

<p>He loved the ant less than any
other insect, because it was so thoughtful
for the morrow. Of the whole
animal world, he cared the most for
birds, who loved him too, and at his
death joyfully sang his triumphant
entry into heaven. The larks, in
particular, assembled at an early hour
on the roof of the cell where the
dead saint lay, with songs of extraordinary
sweetness that lasted for several
hours.</p>

<p>An infinite number of such examples
could yet be cited, but enough
have been given to show how the
animal world lays aside its ferocity
in proportion as man returns to his
primitive state of innocence. This
is quite in accordance with our idea
of the millennium: The wolf also
shall dwell with the lamb, and the
leopard shall lie down with the kid,
and the calf, and the young lion, and
the fatling together, and a little child
shall lead them.</p>

<p>If, then, sanctity brings man back
to his true relations to the Deity, and
restores him to his primitive relations
with nature, let us work our way
back to Eden by our purity, fasts,
vigils, and prayers.</p>

<h2>CATHOLICITY AND PANTHEISM.<br />

<small>NO. XI.</small></h2>


<h3>RELATIONS BETWEEN THE SUBLIMATIVE
MOMENT AND SUBSTANTIAL CREATION.</h3>

<p>It will be the aim of this article
to point out some consequences
which result from the essence and
properties of the supernatural term,
considered respectively to the term
of substantial creation. They go to
establish the absolute supremacy of
the supernatural term over substantial
creation. We shall give them in as
many propositions.</p>

<p><i>1st. In the general plan of the cosmos,
the supernatural term in itself and
in its application, forming that part of
the cosmos which may be called the
supernatural order, takes precedence of
substantial creation, or the natural
order.</i></p>

<p>This proposition is easily proven.
The greater the intensity of perfection
in a being, the nobler is the
being; or, in other words, the greater
amount of being a thing contains
or exhibits, the higher is the place
which it occupies in the ordinate location
and harmony of the cosmos.
The principle is too evident to need
any proof, and we assume it as granted.
Now, we have shown that the
supernatural term in itself and in its
application is by far more perfect
than substantial creation; because it
is a higher and more perfect similitude
of Christ and of the Trinity; because
it is the complement and the
perfection of nature, and enables it
to be joined with the Theanthropos,
and through him to be ushered into
the society of the three divine persons,
communicating with their life,
and thus arriving at the palingenesiacal
state. Consequently, the supernatural
in the cosmic plan must take
precedence of substantial creation,
and in the intention and design of
the creator must precede nature.</p>

<p><i>2d. The supernatural is the end of
substantial creation, and third end of
the exterior action of the infinite.</i></p>

<p>In a series of means co-ordinate
with each other, and depending one
upon another in order to attain a
primary object, that which in force
of the excellence and perfection of its
nature precedes others, is to be considered
as end in respect to those
means which follow next to it in
dignity of nature; otherwise the
means could have no relation whatever
with each other, and the primary
end could not be attained. In a
series of means co-ordination implies
dependence, and this dependence is
established by the superiority of the
one, and inferiority of the other.
Hence the superior means in the
series becomes <em>end</em> respectively to inferior
means in the same series. Now,
we have demonstrated that the supernatural
term precedes nature in excellence
and intensity of perfection;
it becomes, therefore, in the harmony
of the cosmic plan, the end of the
substantial moment; as the Theanthropic
moment is end in reference
to the supernatural, and as God's
manifestation of his infinite excellence
and perfections is the end of the
Theanthropos, and thus the primary
end of the cosmic plan is obtained.</p>

<p>"All things are yours," said St. Paul
of those in whom the supernatural
term is realized: "you are Christ's;
Christ is God's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p><i>3d. The supernatural term is the
exemplar and type of substantial
creation.</i></p>

<p>For it is the end which determines
and shapes the nature of the means.
The creative intelligence of the infinite,
by contemplating the end which
it has in view, and the essential laws
of being residing in his nature, which
is <i>the Being</i>, shapes and fashions mentally
the nature and properties of the
means. Hence it is evident that, the
supernatural term being the end of
substantial creation, it stands towards
it as the exemplar and type to its
copy.</p>

<p><i>4th. The supernatural term is the
mediator between the Theanthropos and
substantial creation.</i></p>

<p>This last proposition is a consequence
of the preceding ones. For,
if the supernatural term precedes
substantial creation in excellence and
perfection of being, if it is its end
and its type, it is evident that, in the
general order and harmony of the
cosmos, its natural place is between
the Theanthropos and substantial
creation. Consequently, it is
mediator between them. Of course,
the intelligent reader will easily understand
that this mediatorship is not
one merely of place and location, but
a mediatorship of action; since the
terms here in question are all agents.</p>

<p>These four properties of the supernatural
moment, which, we flatter
ourselves, have been demonstrated
and put beyond the possibility of
doubt, will enable our readers to see
the philosophy of various other
truths held by Catholicity, and denied
by rationalism, Pantheism, and Protestantism.</p>

<p>And, first, the possibility of miracles
follows evidently from these principles.</p>

<p>A miracle is a sensible phenomenon
superseding or contrary to the established
laws of corporal creation.
A body left to itself by the ordinary
law of gravitation should fall to the
ground. Suppose it should hover
between heaven and earth without
any support, it would present a
phenomenon contrary to the natural
law of bodies. It would be
what is called miracle, from the word
<i>miror</i>, to wonder or to be amazed,
because our intellect is always astonished
when it cannot see at once
the cause of an effect.</p>

<p>The possibility of such phenomena
contrary to the established laws of
nature has been denied by Pantheists
and rationalists, both for the same
reason, though each draw that reason
from a different source. The
Pantheist, who admits that the cosmos
is nothing but that primary
indefinite something which is continually
developing itself by a necessary
interior movement, denies the
possibility of miracles on the ground
that the development of the infinite
being necessary, and being performed
according to the necessary
laws of being, the development must
necessarily be uniform, and the phenomena
resulting from it always the
same.</p>

<p>The rationalist, though not admitting
the germinal primary activity
of Pantheism, asserts the absolute immutability
of the laws of creation,
and consequently cannot concede the
possibility of any contravention to the
results of those laws, without supposing
their total overthrow.</p>

<p>We hold that the possibility of
miracles follows clearly from the
properties of the supernatural moment;
for, if the supernatural moment
precedes nature in force of its
intrinsic excellence and perfection
of being, if it is the end and type of
the natural order, it is perfectly evident
that the whole natural order is
dependent upon and subject to the
supernatural order by the law of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
<i>hierarchy</i>; and consequently it is
evident that the laws governing the
sensible order are also dependent
upon and subject to the supernatural
order, and must have been determined
and fashioned in such a manner
as to serve every purpose of that
same order.</p>

<p>Hence, if the supernatural term, in
order to assert itself before created
spirits, to prove its own autonomy,
its necessity, requires a phenomenon
contrary to the established law of
sensible creation, those laws must necessarily
give way before their hierarchical
superior, otherwise the whole
order of the cosmos would be overthrown.
This consequence is absolutely
inevitable; and any one who
has followed us in the demonstration
of the intrinsic superiority of the supernatural
term over substantial creation,
cannot fail to perceive it. But
to make it better understood we shall
enter for a moment into the very
heart of the question.</p>

<p>Let us take, as an example, the law
of gravitation. Why do bodies left
to themselves fall to the ground? The
natural philosopher, with a look of
profound wisdom, will answer at once,
because of the law of gravitation.
Now, if our philosopher claims to
give no other answer but that which
is within the sphere of his researches,
the answer is correct; because his science
of observation can carry him
no further. But if by the word gravitation
he should pretend to give a
satisfactory ultimate reason of the
phenomenon of the fall of bodies,
his answer would make a metaphysician
laugh. The law of gravitation!
Indeed! But what is that law? Does
it exist in the body, or in God? or
has it an existence independent of
both? If it exists in the body, how
can it be a general law, when each
body is an individuum? If it exist
in God, how is it broken or altered,
or destroyed, when the phenomenon
of a miracle affects only a particular
body? If it has an existence independent
of both, what is it? Is it a
god, or a Platonic idea, and, if so,
whence does it derive the force to
assert itself over God's creation?</p>

<p>These few questions, and many
more which we could bring forward,
show that to account for the fall of
bodies by the law of gravitation, is
to give no particular or satisfactory
reason for the phenomenon.</p>

<p>We have already given one theory,
the theory of the most profound metaphysicians
of the world, that no
finite beings can act without the aid
of God; that God must really and
effectively excite them to action, aid
them during the action until it is accomplished;
because he is necessarily
the first and the universal cause.
Therefore, bodies as well as higher
beings are absolutely dependent upon
God for their action; and that which
natural philosophers call the law of
gravitation, or any other law, such
as attraction, repulsion, and so forth,
in itself is nothing more than the action
of God upon bodies. Now, God
in acting in and upon bodies has
certainly a plan and an order marked
out in his mind, according to which
he acts in and directs them. This
order he has derived from the infinite
laws of being, which are his very
essence, and consequently, in this
sense, that order is stable and immutable.
But it must be borne in mind
that this order marked out in the
mind of God, according to which he
acts in and directs bodies, is <i>not the
whole order of the cosmos</i>. It is only
a part, a moment, and the most inferior
of all. Consequently, it is an
order subject to and dependent upon
the order of the other and higher
moment, and upon the universal order
of the cosmos. Hence the same
divine essence, the eternal model and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
type of everything, at the same time
that it marks out the order for the
acting in and directing of bodies,
subjects it to the order of higher
moments, and to the cosmological,
universal order. In the application,
therefore, of this eternal order marked
out by his infinite essence, God
acts in and directs bodies according
to the stable and immutable order
proper to this moment, until an exception
is necessary. But when the
order of higher moments and the
universal order demand an exception,
the order of the direction of bodies,
being inferior, must necessarily yield
to the superior, and the sensible order
must, so to speak, be suspended
for that occasion. We have said,
so to speak, because even then the
sensible order is not altered or broken,
as rationalism imagines; it is the
application of the general sensible
order to a particular body which is
suspended. It is not the objective
order, but the subjective particular
realization of it, which is superseded.
Let us take as example the law so
often mentioned. The general order
established in the mind of God with
regard to acting in bodies is to make
them gravitate toward the centre of
the earth. Suppose an exception of
this law becomes necessary to assert
the supernatural order. God, upon
that particular occasion, does not
apply the general law in a particular
body, but acts in it contrary to that
law. Is the law of gravitation broken
or altered in consequence of that
exception? If the law were an essential
property of bodies, a natural consequence
of their essence, it would be.
But the law in its general and objective
essence exists in God only; it
does not exist in the body; and consequently
it cannot be altered by a
suspension of its application in a
given case.</p>

<p>Were God to act otherwise than
to admit such exceptions in the subjective
application of the order of
sensible creation, he would go against
reason, and act contrary to his essence;
for in that case he would prefer
a particular and inferior order to
the general and superior order of the
whole cosmos. The true principles,
then, in the present matter are the
following:</p>

<p>1st. The laws according to which
bodies act and are directed do not
exist in bodies, but are an order
marked out in the mind of God as
derived from his infinite essence.</p>

<p>2d. This order is an element, and
an inferior one, of the universal
order of the whole cosmos, and consequently,
by the law of hierarchy, is
subject to that same universal order.</p>

<p>3d. This sensible order is always
stable and permanent in itself and
in its objective state, but in its application
to particular bodies is subject
to variation when this variation
is demanded by a superior order, or
by the universal order of the cosmos.</p>

<p>The reader will observe, after what
we have said, how futile is the argument
of rationalists that a miracle is
impossible because the laws of bodies
are immutable. Certainly, if the laws
exist in the bodies. But the laws of
bodies, as we have said, are nothing
more than the order marked out in
the mind of God, according to which
he acts in and directs them, and, this
order being universal and objective,
is never changed or altered. Only
its application in particular bodies
on a particular occasion is not made,
or made in a contrary sense, because
such is the requirement of the universal
order. If this be kept in view,
every difficulty will vanish in reference
to this matter; for this is exactly
that which prevents rationalists,
from understanding the possibility of
miracles&mdash;their want of perception
that it is <em>God</em> who acts in every single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span>
body. They imagine a general
principle, as if it were self-existing,
which pervades all the bodies, which
ought to be destroyed to permit the
exception. Now, this is a mere phantom.
It is God, we repeat it, who
applies the order marked in his mind
in every single body, which in his
mind <em>only</em> is universal and objectively
immutable, but subjectively, in its
application, it need not be constant,
except so long as no exception
is required. Our natural philosophers
of the rationalistic school
imagine the law of bodies to be a
sort of demigod, stern and immutable,
particularly loth of and averse to
being disturbed, and consequently
cannot see the possibility of a
miracle.</p>

<p>The second truth which follows
from the attributes of the supernatural
moment, is that <i>prayer governs the
universe</i>.</p>

<p>Prayer, taken in its strictest acceptation,
is the universal mode of action
of spirits elevated to the supernatural
moment. To understand
this rightly, it is necessary to observe
that every moment of the action of
God, considered in its term, is possessed
of a particular mode of action
resulting from and befitting its essence
and attributes. Thus, substantial
creation, or the whole aggregate
of being included in this moment, acts
as it were by <i>apprehension and volition</i>.
In spiritual beings, this manner
of acting is strictly and properly
so; in inferior beings, like the brutes, it
is less so, but bears a great resemblance
to it, for the animal has apprehensive
faculties, though wanting
in the power of generalization
and abstraction, and confined within
the concrete and in the individual;
and he has also instincts and tendencies
leading toward the object
apprehended. The vegetable kingdom
acts according to the same
manner, though more materially; for
it apprehends the elements required
for its growth from the earth and the
atmosphere, and, assimilating them
to itself by an interior force, is able
to develop itself. Every one is
aware that the general laws of matter
are those of <i>attraction and repulsion</i>,
which bear a resemblance,
though a faint one, to the law of
apprehension and volition.</p>

<p>Now, the particular mode of acting
in persons elevated to the supernatural
moment is by <em>prayer</em>, which
is composed of various elements according
to various relations under
which it is considered.</p>

<p>It may be considered in itself, its
essence and nature, and in the persons
to whom it has reference. The
persons are the infinite and the finite.
In itself, prayer is divided into two
moments&mdash;a deprecatory moment,
and a life-giving moment.</p>

<p>A deprecatory moment&mdash;because
the effect of the prayer, resting absolutely
on the free will of the infinite,
cannot be claimed by the finite as a
right, but as an effect of an infinite,
goodness yielding to a supplication;
and in this sense it implies the following
elements on the part of the
finite:</p>

<p>1st. An acknowledgment, theoretical
and practical, of the infinite
as being the absolute and universal
source of all good; and of the absolute
dependence of the finite upon
the infinite in all things; this acknowledgment
arising in the finite
from the consciousness and feeling
of its finiteness both in the natural
and the supernatural order.</p>

<p>2d. A gravitation, natural and supernatural,
on the part of this finite
toward the infinite, as the origin
and the preserver of the being in both
orders, as the mover of its natural
and supernatural faculties, and as the
final complement of both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span></p>

<p>3d. A cry to the infinite for the
satisfaction of this aspiration.</p>

<p>4th. A firm and unshaken reliance
of being satisfied in this aspiration,
founded both on the intrinsic goodness
and on the personal promises
of the infinite.</p>

<p>These four elements on the part
of the finite are absolutely necessary
to constitute a prayer in its deprecatory
sense; and they are either implicitly
or explicitly to be found in
every prayer. The spirit who bows
before the infinite must acknowledge
theoretically and practically that
God is the Master and Lord of all
things, the infinite eternal source of
all being and all perfection; he must
acknowledge and be conscious freely
and deliberately that his being comes
from God, and that that same divine
action which created and elevated
it must maintain it in existence, aid
it in the development of its faculties,
and bring it to its final completion.
He must freely and deliberately yearn
after all this, and have firm reliance
that the infinite will maintain his being,
aid it in its growth, and bring it
to its full bloom in the palingenesia.</p>

<p>On the part of the infinite, prayer
in this same deprecatory sense implies
an action of God existing and
aiding the finite in producing the
aforesaid four acts necessary to constitute
a prayer.</p>

<p>If we regard prayer in its life-giving
moment, it implies two elements: one
on the part of the infinite, the other
on the part of the finite. On the
part of the infinite, it implies a real
actual and personal communication,
a giving of himself by a personal intercourse
to the finite; and, on the
part of the latter, a personal apprehension
of the infinite, and an
assimilation of and transformation
into the infinite. We cannot refrain
here from quoting a beautiful page of
a French writer in explanation of this
last element: "When man's will, lifted
by an ardent desire, succeeds in putting
itself in contact with the supreme
will, the miracle of the divine intervention
is accomplished. Prayer,
which <i>renders God present to us</i>,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> is
a kind of communion by which man
feeds on grace, and assimilates to
himself that celestial aliment of the
soul. In that ineffable communication,
the divine will penetrates our
will, its action is mingled with our
action to produce but one and the
same indivisible work, which belongs
whole and entire to both; wonderful
union of grandeur and of lowliness, of
a power eternally fecund, and of a
created activity which is exhausted
by its very duration, of an incorruptible
and regenerating element with
the infirm and corruptible elements
of our being; union, which believed
in invariably, though conceived in
different manner by the savage tribes
as well as by the most civilized nations,
has been under different forms,
and in spite of the errors which have
obscured it, the immortal belief of
humanity."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Now, we maintain that prayer, understood
in all its comprehension,
besides the effect which it produces
in its own natural sphere, is also the
hierarchical superior of the action of
the whole substantial creation; and
that, consequently, the latter must
yield to the former, whenever they
should happen to come in conflict
with each other; and thus, under this
respect, it may be said that prayer
governs the world.</p>

<p>This may be proven by two sorts
of argument; one as it were exterior,
the other intrinsic to the subject.</p>

<p>The first is drawn from the properties
of the supernatural moment.
For, if this moment is superior to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>substantial creation, if it is the end
and type of it, every one can see
that the mode of acting of elevated
spirits&mdash;spirits in whom the supernatural
moment is realized and concreted&mdash;must
necessarily precede and
be superior to the mode of action of
substantial creation, and that the
latter must necessarily be subject to
the former&mdash;unless we abolish and
deny the universal law of hierarchy
presiding and ruling over all the moments
of the exterior action of God,
and founded on the intrinsic and respective
value of beings. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Actio sequitur
esse</i> is the old axiom of
ontology. If the being of the supernatural
moment is superior to the
being of substantial creation, the mode
of action of the first must also, in force
of that axiom, be superior to the mode
of action of the latter. When, therefore,
a natural law, a law of substantial
creation, comes in opposition
with a true prayer, a prayer made
with all the conditions which its
nature requires, the natural law must
yield and give way to prayer.</p>

<p>The second argument is drawn from
the essence of prayer as a life-giving
agent. What is prayer in this sense?
It is an actual communication of the
finite with the infinite, an actual participation
of the infinite and his attributes;
it is a possession which the
finite takes of the infinite, the appropriation,
the assimilation of the infinite.
It is the finite transported and transformed
into the infinite. For in it the
mind of the finite takes hold of the
mind of the infinite, and is, as it were,
transformed into it; the will and
energy of the finite grasps the will and
the almighty power of the infinite, and
is changed, as it were, into it; the person
of the finite is united to the person
of the infinite, and is assimilated to
him. Now, it is evident that prayer
understood in this sense is no longer
an act of the finite alone, but an act
of both the finite and the infinite; it
is the result of the energy of both.
Its efficacy and energy therefore must
be as superior to the energy of all
substantial creation as the infinite is
superior to the finite. Consequently,
it is evident that when a natural law
pregnant with finite energy comes in
conflict with a prayer impregnated,
so to speak, with infinite energy, the
former must yield to the superior force
of the latter.</p>

<p>Prayer governs the world also in a
sense more general than the one we
have hitherto indicated for it. The
sum of all the actions of substantial
creation has been so disposed, and
is so ruled and governed, as to be
always subject to the sum of all the
actions of the supernatural moment,
and this for the same reasons developed
above.</p>

<p>Here it can be seen with how
much reason those philosophers who
call themselves rationalists sneer and
wax indignant at the fact, constant
in time and place, of the importance
which mankind has attached to
prayer for physical reasons, as for
rain, for fair weather, for a good harvest,
and the like. They show evidently
how far they are from understanding
the sublime hierarchical
harmony of the cosmos, which the
simple ones of the earth, who have
faith in God, instinctively feel and
acknowledge. For if God did not
create the cosmos at random without
a plan or design, he assuredly must
have followed and maintained the
necessary relations of things. Now,
if substantial creation and its mode
of action is hierarchically&mdash;that is, in
comprehension of being&mdash;inferior to
the supernatural term and its mode
of action, if the latter is the end and
type of the former, and if they are
not to be kept apart, but to be
brought together into unity and harmony,
and must thus harmoniously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
act, it is clear to the rudest understanding
that the one mode of action
must be subject to the other, and
that consequently, when a prayer is
in opposition with the realization of
natural law, the natural law must
yield, and the prayer must prevail.</p>

<p>Nor will it do to say that if such
were the case the natural order
would no longer enjoy any stability
or permanence, because some prayer
or other might come continually in
opposition to it. For the whole series
of actions of substantial creation
is marked out eternally in the mind
of the infinite. Likewise the whole
series of actions of the supernatural
moment is marked out in the same
mind; they are brought together in
beautiful harmony in the same divine
intellect from all eternity. God has
foreseen when and how a prayer
would require the suspension of the
natural law, and has willed and decreed
it, so that no suspension of
natural law, consequent upon a prayer,
can take place which has not
been foreseen and arranged harmoniously
from all eternity; and if we
could for a moment cast a glance
into the mind of the infinite, we
should see an infinite series of actions
of substantial creation; an infinite
series of actions of the supernatural
moment; all intertwined in a most
harmonious whole, and the different
exceptions here and there only linking
together the two orders, putting
them in bolder relief, and enhancing
the beauty and harmony of the whole
cosmos. The theory which we have
been vindicating explains also a phenomenon
so frequent and so common
in the history of the Catholic
Church&mdash;the saint who works miracles,
or the <i>Thaumaturgus</i>.</p>

<p>A saint is one in whom a certain
fulness of the supernatural term resides,
and hence a certain fulness of
the particular mode of action belonging
to that moment. A saint can
pray well; therefore he can work
miracles, and does oftentimes. Protestantism
has not only denied most
of the miracles not recorded in the
Bible, but has gone so far as to deny
the possibility of such miracles ever
occurring after the establishment
and propagation of Christianity, on
the plea that they are no longer
necessary. It was but a logical
consequence of its doctrine of justification.
If man is not really made
holy in his justification, if he does
not receive in his soul the term of
the supernatural moment as really
inherent in him, it is clear he cannot
have or possess the mode of action
of that moment, still less a certain
fulness of it. Consequently, neither
is he elevated above substantial creation,
nor is his mode of action superior
to the action of that same moment,
and therefore he cannot exercise a
power and an efficacy which he has
not. In other words, a man justified
according to the Protestant doctrine
cannot be a saint intrinsically,
and cannot consequently pray. And
how could he work miracles? It
was natural to deny such possibility.</p>

<p>But endow a man with the supernatural
term in a certain fulness, and
hence suppose him possessed of a
fulness of its mode of action intrinsically
superior in energy to the mode
of action of substantial creation, and
you may suppose he is likely to exercise
it, and work miracles oftentimes.</p>

<p>As to the plea of necessity, it is
absolutely futile. A miracle would
be necessary even after the establishment
of Christianity in all times and
places, which, by the bye, has not
been accomplished yet, if for no
other reason, in order to assert and
vindicate from time to time the existence
and the supremacy of the
supernatural over the natural.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>The third truth emanating from
the qualities of the supernatural moment
is that those created persons
in whom the term of that moment is
realized are essentially mediators between
the Theanthropos and substantial
creation.</p>

<p>The principle follows evidently
from the fourth quality essentially belonging
to the supernatural term, that
of being mediator between the other
moments, the hypostatic and the
substantial.</p>

<p>For if the term of that moment in
intensity of being and perfection
hold a place between the other two
moments, it is evident that those in
whom the moment is realized must
hold the same middle place and be,
consequently, mediators. Hence, it
appears how the Catholic doctrine
of the intercession, and, by logical
consequence, of the invocation, of
saints, is a cosmological law, as imperative
as any other law of the
cosmos. For what does the word
mediator mean? Limiting the question
to location or space, it signifies
a thing placed or located between
two others; in a hierarchical sense,
confining the question to being and
essence, it expresses a thing in essence
and nature inferior to one and
superior to another; in the same
sense, confining the question to action
and development, it exhibits a
thing in its action and development
inferior to the action and development
of one and superior in the same
to another. The person, therefore, in
whom the supernatural term is realized
is mediator in the sense of being
in essence, nature, attributes, action,
and development, superior to the
same things of substantial creation,
and inferior to those of the Theanthropos.
Now, as the cosmos is not
governed by the law of hierarchy
alone, but also by the law of unity
and communion, and as these laws
imply a real and effective union and
communication of being and action
between the terms of the cosmos, it
follows that the person in whom the
supernatural term is concreted is in real
and effective communication with the
Theanthropos, as inferior, and in real
and effective communication, as superior,
with substantial creation; he is
in communication with the former as
subject and dependent, with the latter
as superior, and with both as medium;
that is, a recipient relatively to
the Theanthropos, as transmitting
what it receives from the Theanthropos
relatively to substantial creation;
both relations being exercised by the
person elevated in every sense, either
as receiving from the Theanthropos
and transmitting to substantial creation,
or as representative of substantial
creation before the Theanthropos.</p>

<p>And as we are speaking of moral
persons, that is, free, intelligent agents,
in what can these relations consist
but in this, that elevated persons,
acting as mediums, may intercede
and obtain favors for created persons
from the Theanthropos, and these
may invoke their intercession in their
behalf?</p>

<p>The doctrine, therefore, of the intercession
and the invocation of
saints is a cosmological law, resulting
from the law of hierarchy, unity, and
communion, and governing the relation
of purely created persons with
those elevated to the supernatural
moment.</p>

<p>It must be here remarked that the
mediatorship of persons elevated is
not confined only to persons in their
mere natural state, but it extends
also to persons elevated to the supernatural
moment, because the supernatural
term admits of variety of
degree, some persons being endowed
with a certain fulness of that
moment, some with much less. Those
in whom the fulness is realized are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
hierarchically mediators between the
Theanthropos and other elevated
spirits possessing a less amount of
that term, and can consequently intercede
for the latter.</p>

<p>It must be remarked, in the second
place, that the law governs the cosmos
not only in its germinal state,
but also in its state of completion
and perfection; and we cannot possibly
discover or imagine by what
logical process Protestantism, which
admits this law in the germinal and
incipient state of the cosmos, denies
it to exist between persons elevated
to the state of palingenesia and those
who are yet in the germinal state.
This denial, so far as we can see,
could be supported only by the supposition
that as soon as an elevated
person reaches its final development,
every tie of union, every bond of intercourse,
is immediately broken
asunder between him and other persons
living yet in the germinal state
of the cosmos. But how false and
absurd this supposition would be is
evident to every one who at all understands
the exterior works of God.
The cosmos being measured by time,
is essentially successive; in other
words, all the elements of the cosmos
cannot possibly reach their final completion
at one and the same time,
the law of variety and hierarchy necessarily
forbidding it. It is absolutely
necessary, then, that some
elements should reach their final perfection
first and some afterwards, in
proportion as they come to take place
in the cosmos successively. If, therefore,
by one element of the cosmos
reaching its final development all intercourse
were to be broken between
it and all other elements which have
not reached so high a condition, it
would follow that the cosmos would
never be one, never in harmony, until
all had reached their final completion
and the creation of more elements
entirely ceased. It would be a
continual disorder and confusion until
the end of the world. Now this
is absurd, since unity and harmony
must always govern and adorn
God's works. Nor can we see any
intrinsic reason why it should be
broken. The only plea alleged by
Protestants in support of this suspension
of all communion between the
spirits in palingenesia and those
living on earth, is that there can be
no possible means of communication
between them. They express this
idea commonly by saying that the
saints in heaven cannot hear our
prayers. How philosophical this plea
is we leave it to the intelligent reader
to determine. Suppose we had no
direct answer to give to this plea, the
absolute necessity of the cosmos
being one and harmonious would
make a true philosopher infer that
the infinite must have found a means
whereby to keep up this communication,
though it might be unknown to
us what that means actually is.</p>

<p>But the direct answer is at hand.
The Word of God is essentially the
life of the cosmos. He is the type
of all the essences, of all the natures,
of all the personalities, of all the acts
composing the cosmos. The cosmos,
in all these respects, is reflected
in the Word. "All that was made in
him was life." (St. John.)</p>

<p>Now, all elevated spirits are united
to and live in the Incarnate Word.
The spirits or persons in the germinal
state are united to his person by the
supernatural essence and the supernatural
faculties of intelligence and
of will. This forms the essential
union between them and the Theanthropos.
The spirits in the final
state are united to him in the same
substantial sense, with the exception
that their supernatural essence has
reached its utmost completion, their
supernatural intelligence is changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
into intuition, and their supernatural
will has immediate possession of
God.</p>

<p>The consequence of these principles
is that the spirits in the germinal
state produce acts of invocation to
the spirits in the final state, and these
acts are reflected or reproduced in
the Theanthropos as the type and the
intelligible objective life of the cosmos.</p>

<p>The spirits in the final state see, by
intuition, in the Theanthropos all those
acts of invocation of the spirits in the
germinal state, and thus come to
know what the spirits on earth claim
from them. As orator and audience,
living in the same atmosphere, can
hold intercourse with each other, because
the words uttered by the orator
are transmitted by the air to the ears
of his audience, so the spirits on earth
and the spirits in heaven hold intercourse
with each other, because they
live in the same medium.</p>

<p>The spirits on earth making acts
of invocation to their brethren in
heaven, these acts are reflected or
reproduced in the Theanthropos, and
from him reverberate and reach the
eyes of the spirits in heaven living in
him, and thus they come to the knowledge
of the wants and prayers of
their brethren on earth.</p>

<p>But why such interposition of persons
when we could go directly to
the Theanthropos? Does this not
detract from the mediatorship of
Christ?</p>

<p>Why, but because the cosmos must
be one? Why, but because all the
elements of the cosmos must communicate
with each other? And
how can this doctrine detract from
the mediatorship of Christ when <em>he</em>
is made the source, the origin, the
end of everything? If Catholic doctrine
claimed this intercourse independently
of the Theanthropos, it
would certainly detract from his mediatorship.
But do we not establish
and centre this mediatorship of the
saint entirely in the Theanthropos?</p>

<p>The last truth which follows from
the essence of the supernatural term
is what is called the worship of saints.
This truth is not only a cosmological
law, but an ontological principle, since,
considered in its simplest and most
ultimate acceptation, it implies nothing
more than the duty incumbent
on every moral agent to acknowledge,
theoretically and practically,
the intrinsic value of being. Suppose
a certain being is possessed of a
hundred degrees of perfection, so to
speak, I cannot, without a flat contradiction
to my intelligence, which
apprehends it, deny or ignore it; I
cannot, without a flat contradiction
to my expansive faculty or will, which
is attracted by it, fail to appreciate it
practically. Now, the worship of
saints, against which Protestantism
has written and said so much, is
founded entirely on that ontological
principle. The saint is possessed of
a certain fulness of the supernatural
term. The supernatural intelligence
of other elevated spirits apprehends
this fulness, and the supernatural
will of the same spirits cannot fail to
value it. This theoretical and practical
appreciation is esteem, and
when expressed outwardly is honor
and praise. By the ontological principle
of recognizing the value of being,
therefore, it is evident that the
Catholic theory of the worship of
saints is not only theologically lawful,
but eminently philosophical.
Protestantism, in denying this worship,
follows the same principle without
being aware of it.</p>

<p>It starts from its own doctrine of
justification, which consists, as we
have seen, not in the interior cleansing
of the soul from sin and in its
elevation to the supernatural moment,
but in an external application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
to it of the merits of Christ. The
example of the cloak is most appropriate.
Suppose a man, all filthy and
loathsome; cover him with a rich and
splendid cloak, so as to hide the filth
and loathsomeness, and you have an
example of Protestant justification. It
is all foreign, outward, unsubjective.
Now, apply the ontological principle
of the value of being to a saint of this
calibre, and it is evident that you
cannot esteem and value him because
he is worth nothing subjectively,
and hence the denial of the
worship of saints is a logical consequence
of the Protestant doctrine of
justification, and an application, in
a negative sense, of the ontological
principle of the value of beings.</p>

<p>On the contrary, admit the Catholic
doctrine of justification, whereby a
man is not only cleansed from sin,
but elevated to a supernatural moment,
receiving as inherent in him a
higher and nobler nature and higher
and nobler faculties, and it is evident
that you must acknowledge <em>this</em>,
value, esteem, and honor it.</p>

<h2>SAYINGS OF THE FATHERS OF THE DESERT.</h2>


<p>So that there were in the mountain
monasteries like tabernacles, full
of divine choirs of men singing, reading,
praying; and so great an ardor
for fasting and watching had his (St.
Antony's) words enkindled in the
minds of all that they labored with
an avidity of hope and with unceasing
zeal in works of mutual charity,
and in showing mercy to those who
needed it, and they seemed to inhabit
a sort of heavenly country, a city
shut off from worldly conversation,
full of piety and justice. Who, looking
at such an army of monks&mdash;who,
beholding that manly and concordant
company, in which there was
none to do harm, no whisper of detraction,
but a multitude of abstinent
men and an emulation of kind offices,
would not immediately break forth
into the words: How beautiful are
thy tabernacles, O Jacob, and thy
tents, O Israel! As woody valleys, as
watered gardens near the rivers, as
tabernacles which the Lord hath
pitched, as cedars by the waterside
(Num. xxiv. 5, 6)?</p>


<p class="p2">The disciple of an aged and famous
monk was once assailed by
temptation. And, when the old man
saw him struggling, he said to him:
Do you wish me to ask God to take
away this trial from you? But he
answered: I see and consider, father,
that though I wrestle painfully,
yet out of this labor I bear fruit.
But ask this of God in thy prayers,
that he may give me patience to endure.
And his father said to him:
Now I know, my son, that thou hast
made great progress, and surpassest
me.</p>

the world, think that he has left anything
great.&mdash;<i>From the Life of blessed

<h2>THE ITALIAN GUARANTEES AND THE SOVEREIGN
PONTIFF.</h2>


<p>After having been proposed by
the government of Italy, recast by
the Chamber of Deputies, amended
by the Senate, adopted by the Chamber
as amended, and approved and
signed by the King and his ministers,
the project of the guarantees for the
Sovereign Pontiff's independence has
become a part of the law of the land.
We are perfectly willing to believe
that his majesty, regarding this scheme
as promising the fullest amount of
freedom it was possible to obtain
from his parliament for the Head of
the Church, signed it with a feeling
of relief; for if we are to credit the
rumors, more or less well founded,
one hears in Florence and in Rome,
broken tables and furniture overturned
bore witness to the unwillingness
of the supreme authority in the
state to permit the violation of the
Papal territory or to accept the plébiscite
of the so-called people of
Rome. Not so, however, was it with
the legislators of the kingdom. To
them the Papacy has been and is a
huge incubus, that disturbs their rest,
frightens them in their dreams, and
which can be got rid of in truth only
by their waking up to a sense of what
their real duty is. Their aim has
been, in dealing with it, to yield up as
little as possible of their ill-gotten
power over the successor of St. Peter,
and to secure themselves as effectually
as possible against the only power they
ever feared&mdash;his spiritual weapons.
This is the criterion by which we
should study these guarantees; by
the light of it we propose to examine
them, and to discuss their pretended
advantages.</p>

<p>When the Italian government,
hurried on by the spirit of revolution,
seized upon Rome during the complications
of last autumn that insured
impunity for the moment to the act,
they found themselves face to face
with the spiritual ruler of the whole
Catholic world, and with the fixed
convictions or invincible prejudices
of two hundred millions of men, who
regarded the position in which the
Sovereign Pontiff had been placed as
not only against all law, but also hurtful
to their best interests. How were
they to deal with so delicate a question?
The situation of Europe might
for a time delay the solution, but
eventually there must be an account
given and satisfaction rendered to the
Catholic world. The cabinet hit on the
only means it could hope to use with
any appearance of success, and the
promises of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Sig. Visconti Venosta, served
as a decent pretext to liberal governments
not to interfere actively in the
accommodation of things in Italy.
These promises are contained in the
despatches sent to different governments
during last winter, and published
in the diplomatic documents
laid before the various legislative
bodies of Europe during the past six
months. To do the minister justice,
he has stood out successfully against
the extreme radical party in parliament
that opposed most violently
any idea of concessions such as he
had designed for the independence
of the Sovereign Pontiff, and his appeal
to the loyalty of Italy brought
down the applause of the house, and
effectually destroyed the influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
his opponents. Still, even if we attribute
to any other feeling than fear
of foreign intervention the measures
adopted, they are not for that reason
intrinsically enhanced in value, nor
are they anything more than the most
the Italian government is capable
or willing to do to protect the power
of the Pope.</p>

<p>That power, be it well understood,
is in the eyes of the rulers of Italy
merely a spiritual power, for the temporal,
they consider, was annihilated
by the cannon that beat down the
walls on the 20th of September, 1870,
and by the plébiscite of the 2d of
October following. How does this
law of guarantees confirm the exercise
of that power? We shall see by
referring to several of the articles,
not quoting the law at length, as it
has already appeared in the public
journals.</p>

<p>Article II. says in the last clause:
"The discussion of religious questions
is entirely free."</p>

<p>Article III. says that the Sovereign
Pontiff may have his guards "without
prejudice to the obligations and duties
resulting from such guards, from the
existing laws of the kingdom of
Italy."</p>

<p>Article IV. contemplates the possibility
of the government taking upon
themselves the expenses of the museums
and library of the Pontifical
palaces.</p>

<p>Article V. says these museums,
library, collections of art and of
archæology, are "<i>inalienable</i>."</p>

<p>Article VIII. forbids sequestration
of papers <em>merely</em> spiritual in their
character.</p>

<p>Article XIII. declares that the
ecclesiastical seminaries of Rome,
and of the six suburban sees presided
over by cardinals, are to continue
subject to the Holy See, without any
interference on the part of the <i>scholastic</i>
authorities of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Article XVI. says: "The dispositions
of the civil laws with regard to
the creation and the manner of existence
of ecclesiastical institutions,
and the alienation of their property,
remain in force."</p>

<p>Article XVII. The recognition of
the juridical effects of the spiritual
and disciplinary acts, as well as of
any other act of the ecclesiastical
authority, belongs to the civil jurisdiction.
Such acts, however, are
void of effect if contrary to the law
of the state or to public order, or
hurtful to the rights of private persons,
and are subject to the penal
laws if they constitute a crime.</p>

<p>Let us take a cursory glance at
these cullings from the "guarantees,"
and see if they conflict at all with
the spiritual power of the Pontiff.
Before the twentieth of September,
1870, the whole of the city of Rome
and the dependent provinces were
presided over in spirituals by the
Pope, and all of the inhabitants were
Catholics, except a few Jews, treated
with charity, though not allowed to
make proselytes. By this decree the
door is thrown open to every sect
that chooses to come and try to
proselytize the Roman people. They
must see as clearly as we do that the
last clause of Article II. deals the
most powerful and insidious blow at
the spiritual power of the Pope in
spiritual matters, encouraging his
people to spiritual defection, or at
least lessening him in their esteem as
a spiritual teacher. This is too evident
to need further dwelling on, and
we pass to the next indictment.</p>

<p>The Pope's guards are to protect
him and execute his orders, but inasmuch
as they are not on this account
freed from the obligations of
Italian citizens by the tenor of Article
III., it is quite easy to understand
how in the course of time
elements of discord may arise; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
therefore, in the use of his guards
the Pope must conform to the civil
code of the kingdom of Italy, or
take the consequences referred to
further on.</p>

<p>Articles IV. and V. regard the
library and museums of the Vatican
and of other palaces. The original
draught of the project declared these
collections the property of the state.
The criticism it excited on this account
brought about the modifications
we have here, which substitute
<i>inalienability</i> for the asserted right of
property, without adverting to the
fact that such a modification implies
dominion in the one making it,
while there is contemplated a possible
taking on themselves by the
government of the expenses of these
museums that certainly points to the
same idea.</p>

<p>The VIIIth Article forbids the sequestration
of papers and documents
of the ecclesiastical authorities <em>merely</em>
spiritual in their nature. The inference
is that any other documents
not merely spiritual may be sequestrated;
and, as doubts may arise,
who is to decide? Certainly not
the church or the Pope, for he is
the accused; there is no umpire; and
a strong police force is at the beck
of the Italian government, and the
question will be solved readily.</p>

<p>The XIIIth Article, regarding the
ecclesiastical seminaries and colleges,
exempts them from the control
of the <i>scholastic</i> authorities, but, with
regard to their temporal concerns,
we are told in the XVIth Article they
must be subject to the civil jurisdiction.
We leave it to our practical
men of America to say whether or
not the man who holds the purse-strings
and manages the funds has
any influence on the people he pays
or are paid through him. In the
case before us the Italian civil authorities
are those who pay, having
in many cases the full administration
of the funds. We feel tempted to
refer to the case of the Roman College,
the funds of which have been
withheld since the first of January,
1871.</p>

<p>The first draught of Article XVII.
was too strong. It said openly:
In case of conflict between the civil
and ecclesiastical powers, the supreme
civil tribunal of the kingdom
was to decide. This was toned
down to suit better rather tender
susceptibilities. The result we have
in the clause quoted above, which
says the same thing in other words,
and in stronger terms, if we look to
the penal sanction referred to. Here
is the whole pith of the matter. "As
long as it is possible for us to get on
without dispute," say the government,
"all well; but the moment a
question arises, <em>we</em> must solve it."
Moreover, as the legislative authorities
have made the law, they can
amend or alter it if they think proper,
and there is and can be no
guarantee that they will not.</p>

<p>Such are the disadvantages created
by the vexed project, which from
the amount of discussion it has
caused, deserves the title of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pons
Asinorum</i> of the Italian parliament.</p>

<p>There are several points in this
law which have some title to be
looked on as advantages, relatively
to the condition in which the Sovereign
Pontiff has been placed since
the overthrow of his temporal sovereignty.
These are the inviolability
of the person of the Sovereign Pontiff,
the payment of the monthly sum of
fifty thousand dollars, the protection
of the Conclave as well as of the
Pontiff in the discharge of duty, the
immunity of ecclesiastics employed
by him, the postal and telegraphic arrangements,
and the abolition of the
royal 'placet' and 'exequatur.' But
it is to be remarked that, on the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
place, with regard to some the dignity
of the Head of the Church will
not permit him to avail himself of
them; then with reference to others,
they are imperatively wrung from the
Italian government by the public
opinion of foreign nations; while,
lastly, respecting others, the government
will always have it in their
power to exercise a surveillance that
renders the concessions more or less
nugatory, and in nowise satisfactory
to the people of Catholic and non-Catholic
nations.</p>

<p>But independent of all the above
reasons, there are intrinsic motives
that make any code of guarantees
worth little more than the paper on
which they are indited. All are
agreed that the Head of the Church
must be independent; the Italian
government acknowledges it, and
Catholics and non-Catholics proclaim
it throughout the world. In what
does this necessary independence
consist? It consists essentially in
being free of undue influence from
any source whatsoever. Now, such
freedom can be obtained only by restoring
the Pope to the condition in
which he was prior to the year 1860.
For we can imagine the several other
conditions in which the Pope might
be placed.</p>

<p>He may continue as he is at the
present moment.</p>

<p>He may be the privileged citizen
of a Roman republic.</p>

<p>He may be the sovereign ruler of
the city of Rome under the protection
of the Italian government together
with other governments throughout
the world.</p>

<p>None of these conditions is a
guarantee of his freedom.</p>

<p>In the first place, we suppose him
to be in the condition in which he is
at the present moment. The reasons
we have given above, the practical
experience had of the protection
given to the Pope and those attached
to him, the seizure of the encyclical,
and other acts of which his eminence
the Cardinal Secretary of State has
complained publicly, the subjection
a salary paid by the Italian government
would bring with it, and the
general suspicion to which his acts
are liable, from the influence of the
powerful government under which he
lives&mdash;all make it impossible that
this state of things should continue.</p>

<p>Nor is it possible that the Sovereign
Pontiff should be the privileged and
protected member of a Roman republic.
To tell the truth, the present
state of things is preferable to that.
Republics, and particularly a Roman
republic, are too liable to commotion,
a mob is too easily excited to violence,
a demagogue is too likely to
gain great influence over this city, to
make it at all advisable that the
Pontiff should have republicans for
his neighbors. A prince has duties
to his people, to his dynasty, and to
other nations that check him, and
make him keep order in his realm;
whereas the common people are restrained
by no such consideration,
and a clamorous hostile demonstration,
with a stoppage of supplies,
would very probably be the answer
to any act of the Sovereign Pontiff
that did not meet with their approbation.
The vicissitudes of the days
of Cola di Rienzi are there to show
how incompatible with the mobile
masses of a republic is the necessarily
unbending firmness of a moral ruler.
Not much happier than the foregoing
is the idea proposed by the able deputy
of the Italian parliament, Signor
Toscanelli, who would have Rome a
free city under the sovereign control
of the Sovereign Pontiff and protected
by the Italian government. It would,
practically speaking, be impossible to
eliminate all influence on the part of
the government protecting and closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
in material contact with the Roman
Curia. Even supposing that
the maintenance of the Pope and his
dependents did not come from that
government, it would not be advisable
or satisfactory. In this case, the money
for the support of the ecclesiastical
authorities would have to come
from foreign nations. Although this
would save the Sovereign Pontiff from
much of his subjection to the rulers
of Italy, it would still leave him subject
to influence of another kind very
undesirable. The point is a delicate
one, but we will treat it with all due
consideration for those concerned.
In legislating for mankind, you have
no right to expect heroic actions, and
this more particularly if those actions
pertain to the supernatural order. This
rule is to be applied to the Sovereign
Pontiffs as to every one else. To
their great honor, the Sovereign Pontiffs
have stood nobly firm in the exercise
of the duties of their exalted
state; many a one has shed his blood
for the faith, many a one has languished
in chains for the good of his
flock, many a one has braved the fury
of crowned tyrants for the safety and
well-being of the church of Christ.
But above all praise as their conduct
has often been, you have no right to
put them in a position that requires
the exercise of such heroic firmness.
Now, what is the condition of a Pope
dependent on the precarious contributions
of foreign nations for his
support? It is one in which an external
influence is continually at work
to check him in the free and impartial
discharge of his duty; it is one in
which he is continually forced to
lay aside all human considerations
of prudence and throw himself with
fulness of faith on Divine Providence.
The position is a sublime one, but
for that very reason no man or body
of men have any right to place him
in it. If he sees fit to condemn some
cherished opinion in a nation, the
people cool in their devotion to him,
and as the contributions of which we
speak are voluntary, the disinclination
to receive his decisions brings
with it a disinclination to give spontaneously
what had been so given
before, and the direct consequence
of every pontifical act unacceptable
is very likely to be a diminution in
the funds that come in for the support
of the Pontiff; in fact, if we
may be allowed the expression, these
contributions may be looked on as a
kind of spiritual thermometer, that
by their rise or fall indicate the
warmth or the coolness of feeling
towards the Pope. In point of fact,
it is well known that not a few
prophesied, during the discussions of
the question of the infallibility in the
past year, that the passing of the decree
would bring about a decided
falling off in the Peter Pence. Notwithstanding
this, the Sovereign Pontiff
threw himself upon Providence,
and his hope was not deceived. To
the honor of Catholics throughout
the world be it said, the contributions
of the Peter Pence of to-day exceed
those of all other epochs, and enable
the Holy Father to administer to the
most pressing wants of the flock over
which he personally and directly presides.
The hand of Providence is
certainly here. Such manifestations
of Providence, however, as we have
said, no one has a right in legislating
to look forward to, and therefore it
is absolutely necessary that the Head
of the Church should be the sovereign
of a small state, large enough
to save him from the necessity of tutelage,
and yielding a yearly revenue
sufficient to maintain him and those
he must have around him with the
decorum due to his condition. To
this it may be objected, that his subjects
will be deprived of many advantages
enjoyed by free nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
We are very sceptical about these
advantages; the progress of Rome
under Pius IX. has been solid and
satisfactory; and, on the other hand,
the Roman subjects of the Pontiff
will have many advantages to which
other nations are often strangers: the
advantage of light taxation, the advantage
of laws repressing immorality,
the advantage of peace with
its delightful arts, the advantage of
an enlightened protection of science
and of the fine arts, and then the
great material advantage of seeing
their city the resort of the cultivated
and wealthy classes of all nations,
who flock to Rome to see the successor
of St. Peter, and to enjoy the
gorgeous and imposing ceremonial
of the church. For far less advantages
than these we deprived the
citizens of a portion of our country
of the great privilege of their political
franchise; of all nations we should
be the last to find fault with the infliction
of a similar disqualification,
of much more apparent harm than
real, and which is compensated for
an hundredfold. And this we say
all the more earnestly because, in the
case of Rome, it is not the welfare of
a collection of states that is provided
for, but the peace and good order of
all nations of the earth.</p>

<h2>THE ROSE.</h2>


<p>Is there any portion of mankind
that has not inhaled the sweet perfume
of this lovely flower? From
Borneo to the ruins of the Parthenon;
from Kamschatka to Bengal;
from the neighborhood of Hudson's
Bay to the mountains of Mexico;
from Cairo to the Cape of Good
Hope, it graces the palace and the
chamber, lavishes itself full-leaved on
the processions of Corpus Christi,
and serves as a pretty plaything to
the child, who cracks the swollen
petals on his innocent forehead.</p>

<p>Of it the Hebrews made their
crowns, and in their solemnities
the high-priest wreathed it around
his head.</p>

<p>When the Queen of Sheba visited
Solomon, it is said, she tried every
means to assure herself not only of
his superior wisdom, but also of the
quickness of his perception. She
placed before him one day two roses,
one artificial, but so well made that
she defied the king to distinguish the
false one from the real. He sent for
a bee, which naturally alighted on
the true one, and thus, without approaching
either, was able to give
his decision.</p>

<p>Among the Hebrews, the bridegroom
as well as the bride wore a
crown of roses, of myrtle, or of olive.</p>

<p>Mythology assigns to the rose the
most illustrious origin. At the moment
when Pallas came out of the
brain of Jupiter, the earth produced
the rose, that delight might follow in
the wake of wisdom. White at first,
the poets have not quite agreed to
what it owed its many-purpled hues.
We are told by some that the exquisite
Adonis was mortally wounded
by a boar, and that his flowing blood
fell on the roses, and colored them
for ever. According to others, Venus
ran to protect him, and the
thorns and briers tore her lovely
skin, and the purple drops fell on a
wild rose, dyed it, and consecrated
it for ever in her honor. Such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
circumstance was scarcely necessary
to make so perfect a flower sacred
to the goddess of beauty. Some
authors say that in the midst of
an Olympian fête the goddess
Hebe spilled the embalmed vermilion
nectar, and that the white roses
spread their petals to receive the
perfume and the color.</p>

<p>Mythology also relates that Love
presented to Harpocrates, the god of
silence, the flower that no one had
ever seen, and that consequently
had never revealed anything. Hence
came the custom of suspending a
rose from the ceiling of the room
where families assembled, in order
that discretion, of which it was the
symbol, might become the guarantee
of the sacred security of all their
conversations. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sub rosa</i> (under the
rose) was a proverb that signified:
We can speak freely, without suspicion.</p>

<p>Venus and Cupid were represented
crowned with roses; so, also,
Flora, the goddess of flowers, and
Comus, who presided at festivities.</p>

<p>Aglaë, the youngest of the Graces,
carried the rosebud in her hand, the
attribute of youth and beauty.</p>

<p>The Graces, the Muses, and Bacchus
also received their homage in
crowns of roses; their altars were
hung with garlands, and those good
old servants the Penates were sometimes
decorated in like manner. Of
all the flowers, the rose was dedicated
to the greatest number of divinities,
although nearly all of them had
some plant especially sacred.</p>

<p>The opening hour of day sowed
roses in Aurora's path, who at sight
of her father the sun wept tears of
joy over her favorite flowers. So the
poets of antiquity explain the drops
of dew that tremble and scintillate
on the roses in the morning light.
The rose designates the dawn; and,
bathed with dew, it is the emblem
of filial piety.</p>

<p>Peace is represented holding a
rod of thorns with roses and olive
branches, and the muse Erato, when
presiding over lyric poetry, was
always crowned with myrtle and the
rose.</p>

<p>The appearance of Christianity
gave to the rose another origin, and
we cite the legend. Once, a holy
virgin of Bethlehem, falsely accused
and calumniated, was condemned to
perish by fire. She prayed to our
Lord, beseeching him to come to
her aid, because he knew she was
not guilty of what they reproached
her with. The fire went out immediately;
the burning fagots were
transformed into red-rose bushes covered
with flowers, and those that
were not lit into white ones. These
roses were the first ever seen, and
became from that time the flower of
the martyrs.</p>

<p>The rose appeared at a very distant
epoch as the emblem of the
Virgin; it was particularly recognized
as such by St. Dominic, when he
instituted the devotion of the rosary,
in direct allusion to the life of holy
Mary.</p>

<p>Prayer appears always to have
been symbolized by roses. There is
a story told of a servant who, having
to carry an immense amount of
treasure belonging to his master
through a wood, was there awaited
by a band of robbers. On entering
the forest, he remembered that he
had that morning omitted his Ave
Marias, so he knelt down to say
them. As he prayed, the Virgin
placed a beautiful garland on his
head, to which at each Ave she added
a rose. The brilliancy around
him became intense, and the whole
wood was illuminated. The good
man knew nothing of his beautiful
crown of roses, but the robbers saw
the vision and let him pass unharmed.</p>

<h2>NEW PUBLICATIONS.</h2>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom.</span>
Translated by H. C. Romanoff.
London, Oxford, and Cambridge:
Rivingtons. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a neat little book, translated,
by a Russian, from the original
Greek. The catechism contained
in the front is so very ancient
and Catholic that it will be a difficult
task indeed for those members
of the Protestant Episcopal Church
in England and America who dream
of union with the Greek schism, ever
to reconcile it with the catechism
that begins, "What is your name?
N. or M."</p>

<p>There is a note at the bottom of
page 79, to the effect that, when the
priest signs the elements and says
the words, "And make this bread
to be thy Holy Body, and what is in
this cup to be thy Holy Blood," it is
supposed that the consecration takes
place, or, as the translator says, <i>transubstantiation</i>.
This is an error invented
by the modern Greeks and
introduced by one Nicholas Cabasilas,
contrary to the Council of Florence
and to all Catholic tradition.
For it is the universal teaching and
belief that the consecration or transubstantiation
takes place when the
priest does what Christ did, and
says the very same words that
Christ said: "This is my body; this
is my blood." That is the <i>form</i> of
the sacrament of the Eucharist.
The ritualists object to the Roman
vestments on the ground that they
are not of the ancient shape. We
would like them to look at page 18,
and answer this question: Which is
the more like the ancient vestment&mdash;the
Roman or the Greek? Any
candid man would answer that the
former is. The Greek chasubles are
cut away in front, the Roman at the
sides. However, we hope that the
day will soon come when these good
people will learn that the essence of
religion does not consist in the shape
of a chasuble or the cut of a cope,
but rather in a childlike obedience
to that Infallible Authority which is
able to regulate matters of discipline
and worship as well as to define
matters of faith and morals.</p>

<p>A delicious book for those who
are favored with sensible devotion

<p>The contents of this series are as
follows: "Tales of Catholic Artists;"
"Honor O'More's Three Homes;"
"Sir Ælfric, and other Tales;" "Select
Tales for the Young;" "Tales

<p>These are very far removed from
those tales, selected at haphazard,
too often to be met with in libraries
for the young which are juvenile
but in name, the compilers of which
are apparently ignorant of the fact
that as much depends on judicious
selection as careful rejection. In
external appearance, paper, typography,
binding, and illustration, we
have also displayed, in miniature,
the distinguishing characteristic of
the works issued by the Publication
Society, liberality of expenditure
limited only by the suggestions of
good taste. But, while thus equal
in every respect to the preceding
sets, and coming, too, most opportunely
just in time for the annual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>

one great drawback which the reviewer

six volumes only; each of the

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The State of the Dead.</span> By the Rev.
Anson West. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott
&amp; Co. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>The only "dead" on whose "state"
this work throws any light are those
who, like the author, are dead to the
grace of humility. "Fathers, councils,
creeds, and decrees," says he,
"are of no account and of no authority
in establishing the doctrines
of divine truth"&mdash;(Preface, p. ix.)
"We have ignored these," he adds,
"and have <i>deferred to no one</i>" (<i>sic</i>).
And so, forsooth, his own "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</span>,"
the complacent "we deny" with
which he quashes an argument, <em>are</em>
"of account and authority in establishing
the doctrines of divine truth."
"Divine truth," indeed! What can
he know of that, entombed as he is
in his own self-sufficiency?</p>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Life of the Most Rev. Oliver Plunket.</span>
By the Rev. Patrick Moran, D.D.
8vo, pp. 396. New York: P. O'Shea.
1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>This abridged edition of the life,
sufferings, and execution of the celebrated
Archbishop of Armagh, taken
from the larger work of the same author
published in Ireland some years
ago, will be found, from its intrinsic
merits and portable form, to be a
favorite and popular book among
the mass of American Catholics.
Though relating, in a concise manner,
the leading facts in the life of
that persecuted primate, it is necessarily
deficient in many of the features
which made Monsignor Moran's
original memoir so valuable an
addition to the historical annals of
the reign of the Second Charles of
England. The voluminous correspondence
of Dr. Plunket with the
Internunzio at Brussels and the
Secretary of the Propaganda; his
reports on the condition of ecclesiastical
affairs in Ireland from 1670
till within a short time of his death;
and the decrees of the general and
provincial synods convoked by him,
all of which are very fully reproduced
in the original book, are totally
or partially omitted in the compendium
before us. Still, we are
glad to see an authentic account
of the piety, learning, and heroism
of the illustrious victim of Protestant
intolerance placed within the
reach of all who reverence his memory,
and especially of those who
feel proud in being able to call him
their countryman.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Truce of God.</span> A Tale of the Eleventh
Century. By George H. Miles.
1 vol., 16mo. Baltimore: John
Murphy &amp; Co. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>The contest between Pope Gregory
VII. and Henry IV. of Germany
forms the groundwork of this delightful
story, which abounds with
interesting descriptions of feudal
times, and gives us, with charming
simplicity, the details of the daily
religious life of the people of those
"dark ages," so luminous with the
light of faith.</p>

<p>The character of the intrepid, patient
Hildebrand is drawn with a
skilful hand, and reminds us that
persecution has ever been the lot of
the faithful Vicar of Christ.</p>

<p>The pleasing title of the book
brings to our remembrance the fact
that the church of God in those
days sanctified to peace a portion of
every week, beginning at sunset on
Wednesday and continuing till Monday
morning. All private warfare
was forbidden during these days,
under pain of excommunication.</p>

<p>This precept mingles with the
thread of the story, which is both
attractive and instructive, leaving
upon the mind and heart a most
agreeable impression.</p>

<p>The mechanical portion of the
book is beautifully executed, and
we are delighted to see that all the
books got out this season by Mr.
Murphy are in the same elegant
style.</p>

Ward, M.A., Fellow of St. Peter's College,
Cambridge, and Professor of History
in Owens College, Manchester.
Vol. I. New York: Scribner. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>Every scholar knows how learned
Germans write history. Dr. Curtius
ranks with Mommsen as a historian,
and his <cite>History of Greece</cite>, of which
this volume is the first instalment,
is to be classed with the <cite>History of
Rome</cite> by the latter author. We believe
that it has the advantage over
it of being complete, and, moreover,
its subject is even more interesting
to students and men of letters. It
is brought out in a style of excellence
similar to that of Mommsen's
<cite>History</cite>, leaving nothing in that respect
to be desired. We hope that
the demand for works of this kind
may be sufficient to induce some one
of our great publishing-houses to
favor the public with a translation
of Leo's <cite>Universal History</cite>, which is
the masterpiece of German historical
works.</p>

a Member of the English Church. With
a Preface by the Rev. Frederick G. Lee,
D.C.L., F.S.A., Vicar of All Saints',
Lambeth. London: John Hodges.
1870.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a singular and a singularly
interesting little volume. It is Anglican,
as the title shows; yet, strange
to say, it is made up of brief but well-written
and affectionate memorials
of More, Campion, Arundel, Plunket,
and a number of other illustrious
martyrs of the Catholic
faith and the supremacy of the Roman
Church in England and Ireland.
It is a book which we can unhesitatingly
recommend to Catholics as well
as Protestants, and which we should
rejoice to see extensively circulated.
We cherish the most unbounded veneration
for these heroic martyrs, and
ardently long for the time when they
may be solemnly canonized by the
authority of that Holy See for whose
rights they suffered torments and
death. The author has our thanks
for his pious tribute to the sacred
and holy memory of these blessed
victims of Protestant English cruelty.
May it help to bring England to a
penitent recognition of their merits,
and bring a blessing from God to himself.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The American Annual Cyclopædia
and Register of Important Events
of the Year 1870.</span> Vol. X. New
York: D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>This volume of <cite>Appleton's Cyclopædia</cite>
is certainly, at least considered
as a register of current events, of
unusual interest. No recent year
has witnessed events in Europe of
such importance as have occurred
in 1870; and the accounts given of
them are sufficiently full. Of course
they have been carefully prepared,
and are interesting from the nature
of the case. So far as we have noticed,
the proper scope of such a
publication has been well observed,
plain statements of facts being given
without comment or apparent prejudice.
The statement of the preface,
however, that by the overthrow
of the temporal sovereignty of the
Pope, "liberalism and authority have
been brought to a final issue before
the world," is somewhat objectionable;
as is also, and in a much higher
degree, the introduction of a
portrait of the wretched man who,
unfortunately for himself as well as
others, is the nominal head of the
Italian kingdom, for a frontispiece.
Portraits are also given of two really
distinguished and remarkable men,
Generals Von Moltke and Robert
E. Lee.</p>

<p>The results of the United States
census of 1870 are given, and full
information as to the present condition
and growth of each state. The
scientific information is on the whole
valuable and accurate. In the present
intense activity of research in
this field, it is of course impossible
to admit into a work of this kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
everything of interest and importance,
and nothing besides, and a
better selection could hardly have
been made. The volume is very
creditable to its able and enterprising
publishers.</p>

<p>We have so often spoken in praise
of the volumes of this series, known
as "The Library of Wonders," that it
is with regret we are compelled, as
in the case of the present volume,
to condemn any of them. But such
books as these need careful editing,
and in the volume before us this has
evidently been neglected; for on
page 88 we find "the idolatries of
the Catholic Church," as well as
similar expressions elsewhere, that
unfit it for circulation amongst our
Catholic youth. We would most
respectfully suggest to the publishers
a little more care in future
volumes, if they desire to have these
books placed in Catholic libraries,
or given as school and college premiums,
for both of which they are,
otherwise, admirably adapted.</p>

<h2>INFALLIBILITY.</h2>



<p>We propose to treat this topic in
a manner somewhat different from
the ordinary one, and which may
seem indirect and circuitous. We
hope to come to the point more securely
in this way than by the more
direct road, and to drive before us
the whole body of outlying, straggling
difficulties and objections. In
particular, we intend to place in a
clear, intelligible light the nature,
purport, and ground of the recent
definition of the Council of the Vatican,
which has made the infallibility
of the Roman Pontiff an article of
faith. It is for this purpose that we
have taken up the general topic of
infallibility; and the reason for discussing
this general topic rather than
the exclusive question of Papal infallibility
alone is, that the latter
cannot be properly explained except
in its relation to the former. The
infallibility of the church is a more
general and extensive idea than the
infallibility of the Pope. In the
order of time, it was prior to it in
the minds of the great mass of the
faithful as a certain truth of the divine
revelation, and it was before it
as an article of explicit Catholic
faith. The precise point which many
persons have not clearly understood
has been, how it could have been
less clearly known and less explicitly
believed by a number of good Catholics
before the Council of the
Vatican than after it, especially considering
its very great practical importance.
They are puzzled to
think that it was not an article of
universal, explicit faith always, as
much as the infallibility of the
church. Or, in few and plain words,
they do not understand how a council
could define it as an article of
faith which must be believed as a
condition of Catholic communion,
when it had not been always proposed
as an article of faith, with the
obligation of believing and professing
it, to all the faithful everywhere. If
it is a new dogma, how can it be a
part of the old Catholic faith handed
down from the apostles, and what
authority has a council to create a
new dogma? If it is an old dogma,
how could the denial of its certain,
infallible truth have been tolerated,
and the judgment of a council make
this denial now, for the first time, to
become a heresy, to which the penalty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>of an anathema is affixed? The
answer to these questions is plain
enough to any one who has a moderate
knowledge of the elements of
theology. No council can create a
dogma which is new, in the sense of
being a new doctrine, or a new revelation.
The new definitions of
the Council of the Vatican are definitions
of old truths, old doctrines,
revealed by Jesus Christ and the
apostles, and contained in Scripture
and tradition. But some of the
truths proposed by these definitions,
although old doctrines, and contained
in the original deposit of faith, are
new dogmas in this sense, that they
are more explicit statements of truths
implicitly contained in dogmas previously
defined or declared, and that
they are now newly proposed under
this more precise and extended form
to the faithful, as revealed doctrines,
with the obligation of receiving them
as articles of faith. The dogma of
the infallibility of the Roman Pontiff
was contained implicitly in the dogma
of the infallibility of the church,
and in the dogma, long since explicitly
defined, of the Papal supremacy;
in Scripture and tradition also;
and in the general teaching of the
schools of theology, in a more distinct
and express form. Wherefore,
as we have said, it is useful and important
to show how it is contained
in and related to the general principles
of the essential constitution
and infallibility of the church, as well
as to make an exposition of the specific
proofs of its truth as a distinct doctrine
from the Scripture, the fathers,
and the general teaching which has
prevailed in the church. In this
way, a Catholic, to whom new truths,
or truths less clearly and certainly
known than others, have been proposed
as a part of the Catholic faith
by the Council of the Vatican, will
see that his ideas are not changed
but enlarged, and enlarged not by
an addition of extrinsic matter, but
by the growth and development
within his own mind of the faith
which he already possessed in its integrity.</p>

<p>Let us begin by defining and
clearly comprehending the term <i>infallibility</i>.
It is a negative term in
its literal meaning. Fallible means
liable to err. Infallible means not
liable to err; and infallibility is the
exemption from liability to error.
When we say that the church is infallible,
we say, in strictness of meaning,
that the church is not liable to
err. Her infallibility is some kind
of immunity from error, which is one
of her essential notes. This immunity
from error evidently implies
some sort of unerring possession of
truth, and therefore denotes a positive
quality or prerogative, as is
frequently the case with terms of
a negative form. What it denotes
in Catholic theology we will explain
more fully as we proceed. The positive
idea, in which the general
notion of infallibility has its foundation,
is one of the first principles not
only of Catholic theology, but of all
theology and philosophy. The unerring
and certain possession of some
eternal and universal truths is, and
must be, affirmed by all who profess
that man has or can have the knowledge
of God and of the relation of
his own soul to him, whether by reason
or revelation; that is, by all
except sceptics. With sceptics we
wish to have nothing to do, for they
are not entitled to be treated as rational
beings. Every rational man
will admit that there is such a thing
as wisdom, and that the wise man
possesses it, and therefore knows
something in the order of rational
truth. St. Augustine has proved this
in a most subtle and conclusive manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
in his short treatise, <i>Against the
Academicians</i>, the earliest of his published
works, written while he was
preparing for baptism. The wise
man, he proves, cannot have the
notion of probability or verisimilitude,
unless he has the idea of truth. He
knows, at least, that there is such a
thing as truth, otherwise he could
not affirm in a reasonable manner
that anything is probably in conformity
with truth, that is, appears
to be true, or resembles truth, which
is the meaning of verisimilitude.
Moreover, every man is forced to
admit the certain truth of a number
of disjunctive propositions. "I am
certain that the world is either one
or not, and if not one, either a finite
or an infinite number. Also, that
this world has its order, from a merely
physical law of nature, or some
higher power; that it either is without
beginning or end, or else has a
beginning and no end, or had no
beginning but will have an end, and
numberless other things of the same
kind."<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> In the same manner, we
may say: Either the visible world is
an illusion or real; either God exists
or he does not exist; Christianity
is either true or false; either
Catholicity is genuine or counterfeit
Christianity; either the existence of
God, the truth of the Catholic religion,
the infallibility of the Catholic
Church, can be proved with certitude,
or they cannot be proved. These
disjunctive propositions can be multiplied
indefinitely, and they are
only different examples of that principle
of logic called the principle of
contradiction, which it is impossible
for any one seriously and intelligently
to deny or even to doubt. Reason,
therefore, forces us to affirm that
we know something with unerring
certainty, that is, that the human
intellect is at least to this limited
extent exempt from liability to deception
or error, and, so far, infallible.
The only possible dispute in philosophy
or theology relates to the
subject and extent of infallibility.
What truths are known or knowable
with infallible certitude, and where
is the infallibility seated which gives
this certitude?</p>

<p>Every man who affirms that God
obliges the human conscience to give
a firm and undoubting assent to certain
truths, and to obey certain moral
rules, must admit that he also gives
the means of knowing with unerring
certainty these truths and moral rules.
Even the probabilist cannot escape
this. For he who would act safely
on a probable conscience must have
a reflex certainty that he does not
sin in doing so. If we are bound to
assent to truth, and to obey law, of
which we have only probable evidence,
and this obligation is certain,
we must know with certainty that we
are subjectively acting in a right
manner in giving our assent and obedience.
A philosopher who affirms
that we have certain knowledge of
this truth and this law is, of course,
a more strict infallibilist than the other.
Yet the principle is in common.
When a man affirms that God has
made a positive revelation, and that
in his revelation he has disclosed
truths and promulgated laws which
he binds the conscience of every one
to whom they are proposed to believe
and obey, he extends the principle
of infallibility much further. If I
am to believe these truths, especially
such as are above reason, with a firm,
undoubting assent, and to be held
bound to keep these laws, especially
such as are hard to keep, the revelation
must be made to my mind in
such a manner as to give me certainty,
without any fear of error. Whoever
admits this must assent also to
the following disjunctive proposition:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
Either the revelation of God is made
known to the individual mind through
the medium of the Catholic Church,
or in some other way. We are not
concerned at present to prove the
proposition that the revelation is
made known through the church as
a medium. Our argument is immediately
directed to those who admit
and believe it already. Therefore,
leaving aside all discussion with those
who are not Christians or not Catholics,
we merely affirm, as a consequence
from what has been proved,
that the principle of infallibility, so
far as Christian faith is concerned, is
seated in the church as the medium
of divine revelation. With us Catholics
it is unquestioned that the church
is that visible society whose supreme
head is the Pope. Our only object
of investigation is the nature, extent,
and more precise seat of that infallibility
which the church possesses as
the depository of divine revelation,
and the medium of communicating
it to individual minds.</p>

<p>The church is infallible. To make
more plain the meaning of this proposition,
let us go back once more
to the etymology of the term infallible.
The Latin word from which it
is derived is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fallo</i>, signifying <i>deceive</i>.
Infallible signifies incapable of being
deceived or deceiving. The church,
as infallible, cannot be deceived or
deceive, respecting that body of truth
which has been deposited in her by
the apostles, and which they received
from Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit.
The positive and fundamental
truth from which this negative statement
of the inerrancy of the church
is derived, and which it protects, is,
that the church, as a visible, organized
society, is the immediate recipient
of a certain divine revelation, and
the medium of its transmission and
communication. This divine revelation
must be accepted and believed
with a firm assent, excluding all
doubt, by each individual. It is a
revelation of dogmas and doctrines,
some of which are mysteries above
reason, and of laws which are strictly
obligatory. Each individual must
receive the faith and law from the
church, of which he is a member by
baptism, with unquestioning submission
and obedience of the intellect
and will. But this entire, unreserved
faith and obedience could not be
justly exacted, unless the church were
divinely enabled to impart pure, unmixed
truth, and to prescribe pure,
unmixed holiness to her members,
and divinely secured from imparting
or prescribing error or sin. Authority
and obligation are correlative in
nature and extent. As is the obligation,
so is the authority. If the obligation
is universal and without reserve,
the authority is sovereign and
supreme. If the obligation requires
an absolute, undoubting assent of the
mind, and a divine faith, the authority
must be infallible. Whoever is
bound to unconditional assent must
be secured in immunity from error in
believing. Whoever is authorized to
command assent must be secured in
immunity from error in teaching. Supreme
and sovereign authority in
teaching, and absolute obedience in
receiving what is taught, require and
exact, as a necessary condition, inerrancy
in that society which is constituted
on the principle of this authority
and its correlative obedience.
The fundamental idea of the Catholic
Church, therefore, contains in it
that passive and active infallibility
which belongs to the hierarchy and
the faithful as composing one body
under their head, the Roman Pontiff.
Wherever divine and Catholic faith, or
certain knowledge derived from faith,
and the obligation of unreserved,
complete assent and obedience, are
found, there is the passive infallibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
of the church. Wherever supreme
teaching authority is found, commanding
this obedience, declaring or defining
this faith, or revealed doctrine,
or certain truth derived from and depending
on it, there is the church's
active infallibility in exercise. The
influence of those gifts of the Holy
Ghost by which the church is rendered
infallible pervades the whole
body of the church, and manifests
itself in the most multiform ways.
The church is living and immortal.
Her life is divine and supernatural,
and its principle is faith. The faith
is, therefore, the principle of an immortal
life, and itself an immortal
principle within the church. Like
the principle of animal vitality, it is
found in every part of the organization,
but vitalizing each organ and
member in a different way, according
to its function. Brain, heart, lungs,
and fingers are vitalized by the same
principle, although each one fulfils
a special office. So in the church,
the supreme head, the hierarchy, the
laity, are animated by the same divine
principle of faith, and concur
in the general functions of the great
organic unit, but each in his own
place and in a special office. The
result of their combined and complex
action is the perpetuation of
the divine revelation in all times and
places until the end of the world.
We have to consider, therefore, a
great many other constituent parts,
organs, and members of the body
of the church, as well as the head,
in order to understand the relation
which the head bears to them and
they to it, and the manner in which
its special function influences and is
influenced by the other functions.
We can do this only in a brief and
imperfect manner in a short essay,
but we will endeavor to touch
upon some of the principal parts
of this great and extensive subject
in a manner sufficient for our purpose.</p>

<p>The revelation which proceeded
from the Incarnate Word of God
was diffused, in a great variety of
ways, by the apostles, and committed
to a great number of various channels
for transmission through the coming
ages. They gave it to the faithful
by their preaching, they embodied
it in the hierarchy, in the sacraments,
in the creed, in the liturgy,
in fasts and festivals, in rites, ceremonies,
and worship. They taught
it to their companions and successors
in the episcopate in the most complete
and thorough manner. They
committed it to writing, in great
part, in their inspired scriptures, and
gave their sanction to other books
written under divine inspiration by
those who were not apostles. To
use a figure, there are many great
rivers by which the inspired and divine
doctrines of the apostles flow
through all parts of the world, and
through all the succeeding periods
of time. The great sources of these
rivers are, nevertheless, but two:
Scripture and tradition. The Holy
Scripture is infallible, as well the
Old Testament, which is proposed
anew to Christians by the church, as
the New Testament, in which the
clearer and more complete revelation
is contained. Apostolic tradition
is infallible, and therefore Catholic
tradition, which is an unerring
transmission of it, is also infallible.
The written and oral teaching of the
apostles has come down to us by the
numerous great rivers and the smaller
numberless rivulets of Catholic
tradition, irrigating the fields and
gardens of the church, and opening
the way to intellectual communion
between different countries and centuries.
These streams can be traced
back to their sources by the student.
The single doctrines of faith and theology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
can be traced one by one,
and the whole body of doctrines, as a
complete system, can be followed
up, through the expositions, meditations,
and commentaries of saints,
doctors, and fathers of the church,
to the Holy Scripture. In the same
way, the student can go back to the
original tradition. He is not restricted
to one line of argument or
evidence, for there are many converging
lines, each one more or less
certain and sufficient by itself, and
all, taken together, irresistibly and
overwhelmingly conclusive and convincing.
One who is not able to
make an investigation of this kind
may, nevertheless, be competent to
understand the general and equally
conclusive argument from prescription.
He may know enough of history
to be aware that the principal
doctrines of the faith were universally
held in the tenth century, still
further back in the fifth, and before
that, indefinitely, without any record
of a change, or any adequate cause
for such general consent, except the
teaching of the apostles.</p>

<p>Not only are the Scriptures and
apostolic tradition infallible sources
of doctrine which is unerringly transmitted,
but the general sense and belief
of the faithful is also infallible.
The faithful have received from the
beginning the teaching of the divine
revelation by a supernatural sense,
a divine gift of faith, so that the revelation
has not remained merely
extrinsically proposed to them, but
also received and appropriated by
them, in a living manner, through
the inward operation of the Holy
Spirit in their minds. This sense of
the faithful is even one of the motives
of the definitions made by popes
and councils. It was consulted by
Pius IX. when he was preparing to
make his decree respecting the Immaculate
Conception, and it was recognized
at the Council of the Vatican
as expressed in the numerous
petitions for the definition of papal
infallibility. The body of the faithful
cannot lose the faith, or any part
of it, or embrace any heresy as belonging
to faith. Their unanimous
consent in doctrine is an infallible
evidence of the true faith in itself,
and a note of the true religion. The
body of the church is immortal in
the life of faith, and indefeasible in
its supernatural existence, and therefore
infallible, as well as the head.
It cannot separate from its head in
doctrine. The universal recognition
of the Pope by the church makes it
infallibly certain that he is the true
and legitimate Pope, and the universal
acceptance of a council as
œcumenical makes it infallibly certain
that it is a true council, although
it be certain also, on other infallible
motives, that Pope and council are
legitimate. The want of this universal
recognition caused for many
years the legitimacy of certain popes
to be doubtful in a large part of
Christendom, and of course made the
authority of their decrees doubtful,
and would have made the authority
of any council convoked by them as
a general council also doubtful. It
was the unanimous agreement of the
whole church in recognizing Martin
V. as the true successor of St. Peter,
which gave to all the faithful certainty
that he was their lawful head.
If a Catholic had no other evidence
that the dogmatic decree of Pius IX.
declaring the Immaculate Conception
a doctrine of faith, and the decrees
of the Vatican Council defining
the infallibility of the Pope, are
valid and binding, except the universal
profession of the faithful that
they believe these doctrines with a
divine and Catholic faith, that alone
would be sufficient to give him infallible
certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span></p>

<p>The infallibility of the church in
this general sense, which is an attribute
of the whole body or visible society,
includes and exacts the infallibility
of the teaching and ruling hierarchy
in a special and particular
sense, which is also capable of an independent
proof of its own. The
faithful are subject to the hierarchy
and dependent on it for the sacraments,
for regulation, and for instruction.
All that life which is diffused
throughout the body must exist
in a more immediate and intense
action in its highest organs. An infallible
church cannot be subject to
a fallible teaching authority. The
apostles were infallible witnesses,
teachers, and judges, in respect to the
faith and everything connected with
it, as the original founders of the
church under the Lord Jesus Christ,
by whom they were immediately
commissioned. The church was
made infallible by participation with
them, as they were made infallible
by participation with Christ, who was
himself infallible as the Son of God.
The authority of officially declaring
the testimony of the church, of teaching
authoritatively its doctrine, of
judging in all controversies, and of
punishing all delinquents, was left by
the apostles to their successors the
bishops; and the special authority
of St. Peter, as the Vicar of Christ,
was transmitted by him to his successors
in the See of Rome. In their
prophetical office, as the immediate
organs of the revelation of the Holy
Spirit, they left no successors, for
when the faith and law of Christ
were once fully revealed, the necessity
of this office ceased. But their
official infallibility was, of necessity,
perpetuated in that episcopal order
which inherited the hierarchical dignity
and authority of the Apostolic
College. The church is infallible in
teaching and judging, as well as in
keeping and professing the deposit
of faith, and accepting what is taught
by lawful authority. Every Catholic
knows this to be a fundamental
doctrine of the faith. But it is the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ecclesia Docens</i>, the church or assembly
of prelates, which is meant
in this proposition. There is no infallibility
in fathers, doctors, theologians,
priests, or the faithful generally,
which is separate from or independent
of the authority of the episcopate.
Even bishops who separate
from the unity of their order by
revolting against its supreme chief,
lose all their authority. No matter
how many bishops, priests, and laymen
separate from this unity, their
whole number is of no more account
than if there were but one, since
they are totally cut off from the
church. Tertullian, Apollinaris, Cranmer,
Luther, the whole mass of
Oriental schismatics and other seceders,
count for nothing. Those who
revolt from the unity of the church
lose the grace of faith, and have no
longer any share in the church's infallibility.
The consent of fathers,
doctors, theologians, and of the faithful
is infallible, because it represents
Catholic tradition, which is itself a reflection
or image of the authoritative
teaching of the apostles and their successors.
There is no contradiction or
dissension possible in truth, but only
in error. In how may ways soever
the truth infallibly manifests itself,
these various manifestations must
always agree with each other. In
order that the official teaching and
judgments of the episcopate may
always agree with Scripture, tradition,
with each other, with the teaching
of fathers, theologians, doctors,
and the consent of the faithful, they
must be infallible. All alike being
infallible, they must agree. No individual,
or number of individuals,
therefore, can be qualified to cite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
either Scripture or tradition against
the authority of the church, any more
than to cite the authority of one apostle
against that of another apostle.
To do this, is merely to oppose private
judgment, individual opinion,
to public, official, and authoritative
judgment, which is destructive of the
very principle of authority and organization.
The supreme teacher and
judge must decide in all doubtful and
disputed cases, without appeal, what
is the doctrine and law, what is the
sense of Scripture, the witness of
tradition, the doctrine of the fathers,
the common belief of the faithful.</p>

<p>From this final and decisive authority,
and the correlative obligation
of obedience, we derive another and
most cogent proof, that wherever
sovereignty in the order of ideas or
doctrinal supremacy resides in the
church, it must be there that the
active infallibility of the church is
principally seated. A supreme and
final judgment or decree must be an
infallible judgment. It is irretractible,
irreformable, irreversible. The
church is committed to it, and bound
by it for ever, and that by the law of
God. It must be, therefore, the absolute
truth, and whatever tribunal
is qualified to pronounce it to be so,
and to exact unlimited assent and
obedience from all the faithful, must
be infallible.</p>

<p>We must be careful, however, not
to limit the authority to teach, and
to require outward obedience or even
inward assent, or the obligation of
submission to authority, to the sphere
of infallible declarations and judgments.
In the natural order itself,
we are frequently bound in conscience
to assent to things which
are only probable, and to act on
the supposition that they are true.
Probability is the only and the sufficient
guide of life in most things.
Self-evident and demonstrable truths,
and indubitable facts, are comparatively
few in number. Without
a basis of certitude, there would
be no such thing as real versimilitude
or probability. But with that basis
we can construct a great edifice of
beliefs, opinions, and practical rules,
which have more or less of the firmness
and stability of their foundation.
The probability of these beliefs is to
a great extent extrinsic&mdash;that is, derived
from authority which in reason
and conscience we are bound to respect.
It is reasonable, and it is a
duty, to receive the instruction of
parents, teachers, masters, with docility;
to respect the authority of
learned and wise men, of tribunals,
and of the common sense of society.
In the supernatural order it is the
same. The authority of the Holy
Scripture is not restricted to that
portion of its teaching which the
mind perceives with an absolute certitude.
There is a moral obligation
on every student of the Scripture to
give its probable sense and meaning
that inward assent which corresponds
to the degree of probability which
his mind and conscience apprehend,
and which may approach indefinitely
near to certainty. It is the same
with tradition, and with other sources
of Catholic doctrine, such as the
teaching of standard authors in dogmatic
and moral theology, the official
instructions of confessors, preachers,
and pastors of the church, including
those of councils and of the Sovereign
Pontiff. Under this head are
to be classed the decrees of the Roman
Congregations, excepting those
cases in which the Pope gives them
a higher sanction than the one ordinarily
given. There is, therefore,
a wide sphere in which an authority
is exercised within the order of ideas
which is legitimate, and to which
deference and obedience are due, but
which is not guaranteed to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
complete and perpetual immunity
from all error. We cannot say, therefore,
that there cannot be any exercise
of teaching authority in the
church which is fallible, but only that
the church cannot be left without
any authority except that which is
fallible. To a certain extent, Scripture
and tradition may be ambiguous,
doubtful, capable of being interpreted
differently; but we cannot be left
altogether in doubt or uncertainty
about their meaning. Catholic
schools may have their differences
about dogmatic or moral theology,
but they cannot be altogether divided
and dissentient. The common
belief of the faithful may shade off
insensibly, so that it is difficult or
impossible to draw a precise line between
what is in itself pertaining to
faith and that which is only opinion,
but it cannot be in all things indistinct
and vague. The confessor, the
pastor, the bishop, the theologian,
the father of the church, may teach
something which is erroneous, but
this liability to error cannot be universal.
The tribunals of the church,
even, may be obliged to decide upon
partial and incomplete evidence and
knowledge of the cause, and afterwards
to annul their decisions, as in
the case of the heliocentric theory.
But these tribunals cannot be always
and altogether without a higher and
more certain rule to guide them.
There must be a supreme and sovereign
authority in the church which
is infallible, and which can guide, direct,
restrain, and correct all inferior
and fallible exercise of authority.
This sovereign authority is only exercised
in the declaration and definition
of doctrine in an irreversible and
irreformable manner, and with an
obligation annexed of that assent
which excludes even a hypothetical
doubt, or a right of ever withdrawing
or modifying assent. It is this
authority which we say must be infallible.
And, moreover, it is impossible
to conceive of the real existence
of an authority of this kind which is
not infallible. The belief of the infallibility
of the church was therefore
contained, from the first, demonstrably,
in the belief of the supreme
authority of the church. Moreover,
it has always been distinctly believed
and taught, as well as acted on, in
all ages, and has been explicitly declared
by the Council of the Vatican,
and, so far as the Pope is concerned,
defined in express terms.</p>

<p>This infallible and perpetual magistracy
of the church is exercised in
its ordinary way by the official teaching
of the Catholic episcopate, whose
supreme head is the Pope, and of the
priests commissioned by them to
teach. It began before the New
Testament was written, and continued
for nearly three hundred years
before any œcumenical council was
held. It is a great mistake to fancy
that either the Scripture, or the decrees
of councils, created the faith.
It existed before them, and was apprehended
with a vividness and distinctness
perhaps surpassing anything
which has been witnessed in later
periods.</p>

<p>The solemn and special exercise
of this magistracy is through the
judgments and definitions of the
Holy See, either with or without the
concurrence of œcumenical councils.
These solemn acts have had for their
first object to express in definite terms
what was always taught and believed
as of the Catholic faith, and to condemn
all opposite errors. Their second
object has been to declare and
define revealed truths contained in
Scripture and tradition, but not proposed
by the church as of Catholic
faith before their solemn definition.
Their third object has been to define
truths not revealed, but so connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
with or related to revealed truths,
that they are necessary to the protection
of the faith and law of the
church. Many of the judgments belonging
to the last two classes, also,
are negative in their form, that is,
condemnations of heretical, erroneous,
or otherwise censurable tenets
and opinions. The necessity for making
these definitions has been so constant
and frequent during the history
of the church, that the principal doctrines
of the faith, and a vast body
of doctrine pertaining to or connected
with it, are distinctly and explicitly
taught in the collection of the
acts of the Holy See and the œcumenical
councils. It would be, however,
a most grievous error to suppose
that everything contained in
Scripture and tradition, much less
the whole body of truth which is capable
of infallible definition, has been
exhausted, or could be expressed in
a certain definite number of propositions,
to which no addition could
ever be made. The fountain is inexhaustible.
And, no matter how long
time may last, the church can still
proceed to make new and more explicit
elucidations and definitions of
that complete and Catholic body of
truth which she has held and taught
either explicitly or implicitly from
the beginning. The notion that the
church is a merely mechanical medium,
for transmitting a definite and
precise number of propositions of
faith, is wholly false. It is the notion
of a certain number of Anglicans,
but wholly foreign to the true
and Catholic idea. It is not only heterodox,
but rationally untenable and
ridiculous. Equally so is the common
Protestant notion of a division
among revealed truths into two classes,
the fundamental and non-fundamental,
in the sense in which those
terms are used by Protestant theologians.
Undoubtedly, there are mysteries
and doctrines which are fundamental
in the sense that they are at
the basis of Christianity, and more
necessary to be universally known
and explicitly believed than any others.
And, consequently, there are
other truths which belong to the superstructure,
to the minor and less
principal parts of the system, or to
its finish and ornamentation. But,
in the sense to which we have reference,
they are all equal. That is,
there is the same obligation of believing
any one revealed truth as
any other, because the authority of
God is equally sovereign and majestic
in each single instance. We are
bound to believe, implicitly, everything
contained in the written and
unwritten word of God. Whatever
the church proposes as a revealed
truth we are bound to believe explicitly
as a part of the Catholic faith,
as soon as we know it. Whatever
else we know certainly to be contained
in the word of God, we are bound
to believe by divine faith. In regard
to all that portion of revealed
truth which is not thus clearly made
known to us, we are bound to submit
our minds unreservedly to the
decisions and judgments which the
church may hereafter make, and in
the meantime to adhere to that which
seems to be the truth. A Catholic
must not only believe what the
church now proposes to his belief, but
be ready to believe whatever she
may hereafter propose. And he must,
therefore, be ready to give up any
or all of his probable opinions so
soon as they are condemned and proscribed
by a competent authority.
Moreover, he must believe what the
church teaches, not simply or chiefly
because he has convinced himself by
his own investigations that her doctrines
are really contained in the
word of God, but because the infallible
authority of the church proposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
them as revealed doctrines. The
latest decisions of the church have,
therefore, the same authority as the
earliest. The Council of the Vatican
is equally sacred with the Council
of Trent, and the Council of
Trent with the First Council of Nicæa.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to prove to any
tolerably instructed Catholic that this
is the only doctrine which has been
recognized as orthodox, or taught
with the sanction of the hierarchy,
within the Catholic communion. It
is found in all our catechisms and
books of instruction, and preached
by all pastors. It is an amazing fact
that some ostensible converts to the
church in England, who have lately
renounced their sworn allegiance to
her authority, have declared that
they never understood this doctrine.
This only shows the depth of the
ignorance of Catholic doctrine which
prevails among many of the most intelligent
and educated Protestants, especially
those of the Anglican sect. Priests
educated in the faith from their childhood,
cannot easily apprehend such
ignorance in persons who apparently
hold Catholic doctrines and are attracted
by Catholic ceremonies. They
may, therefore, in some cases presuppose
in their catechumens an understanding
of the fundamental Catholic
principle which they have not,
and pass them in with a superficial
instruction which leaves them as
much Protestants as they were before.
It is to be hoped that greater
precaution will be used hereafter in
this important matter. It is also
true that a number of nominal Catholics,
and, sad to say, some priests,
a few of whom had stood in high
repute, have recently manifested to
the world how utterly they had in
their secret hearts thrown off the allegiance
due to the authority of the
church. But these examples prove
nothing. It is as clear as the sun
that the doctrine we have laid down
is the doctrine of the Catholic Church.
It is the doctrine of Bossuet as well
as that of Bellarmine, of Waterworth
as well as of Wiseman. No other
doctrine has ever been tolerated
in the church, and if any have
held or taught any other, at any
time, who have not been personally
condemned and excommunicated,
they were still only pretended but
not real members of the Catholic
communion. A most signal manifestation
of the universal faith of the
church in this doctrine was made in
the year 1854. The doctrine of the
Immaculate Conception, which St.
Thomas and many other Dominican
writers had opposed without censure,
and which the Holy See had strictly
forbidden all theologians to call a
dogma of Catholic faith before the
definition, was then proclaimed as a
dogma of faith by Pius IX. with the
applause of the whole body of bishops,
clergy, and faithful. Another
one has been made within the last
year by a number of bishops, priests,
and other Catholics, who have given
up their opinions respecting the infallibility
of the Pope, and have received
that doctrine as a doctrine of
faith, simply upon the authority of
the Council of the Vatican.</p>

<p>This remark brings us to a part,
and a very important part, of our subject,
which we promised at the beginning
of this article to treat of at
its close, and thus give a complete
view of the doctrine of infallibility.</p>

<p>The definition of the Council of
the Vatican, by virtue of the foregoing
principles, furnishes every one
of the faithful with an infallible
motive for believing the infallibility
of the Pope as a dogma of faith, and
imposes the obligation of faith on his
conscience. The teaching of the
universal episcopate, in accordance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
with that definition, furnishes another
equally infallible motive. And so
does the universal belief of the faithful,
who receive and submit to that
infallible definition of the council.
There is, moreover, such an abundance
of proof from the Scripture,
and the most conspicuous monuments
of tradition, of the doctrine in question,
that any person of ordinary
education is capable of understanding
enough of the evidence in the case
to make a reasonable judgment, and
might have done so, even before the
case was decided. The fact that a
small number of theologians held a
different opinion was really of no
weight at any time, considering the
vastly preponderating weight of the
judgment of all the saints, the great
majority of theologians, and almost
the entire body of the bishops.
Whatever seeming probability the
opinion of this small minority might
have had in the minds of some
having been totally destroyed by the
judgment of the council, the reasons
from Scripture and tradition gain
now their full force and are seen in
their true light. But the purpose we
have had in view, and which we
stated at the outset, is not the exhibition
of these specific proofs, but
the exposition of the relation of the
new definition to the supremacy itself
and the general doctrine of infallibility;
as well as an answer to the
question, how the infallibility of the
Pope could have remained so long
without an express definition.</p>

<p>In the first place, as to the supremacy.
The Pope is, by divine right,
supreme ruler, supreme teacher, and
supreme judge over the universal
church, and over all its priests and
members, individually and collectively.
As supreme ruler, he must be
infallible; not indeed in all his particular
acts, but in his principles and
rules of government. Otherwise, he
might subvert the constitution of the
church, destroy morality, oppress and
depose the orthodox prelates, promote
heretics to the highest places, and
do in the Catholic Church what the
schismatical Eastern patriarchs have
done, and what Cranmer did in England.
By the very supposition, there
would be no authority in the church
to control him, and all the prelates
and faithful would be bound to obey
him. For, if there is any authority
in the church superior to the Papal
authority, the supremacy is in that
authority, and not in the Pope. As
supreme teacher, he can instruct all
Christian bishops, as well as laity,
in regard to the doctrine which they
must believe, and bind their consciences
to submit to his teaching.
It follows from our entire foregoing
argument that infallibility is necessary
to the possession and exercise of
such a power. As supreme judge in
questions of faith and morals, his
decision must be final and irreversible;
for there is no judge above
him except our Lord Jesus Christ
himself. But the final judgments
which the whole Catholic Church is
bound to accept must be infallible.
Sovereignty, or the possession of the
plenitude of power, when it extends
over the realm of mind and conscience,
exacts infallibility. And this
has been most lucidly and conclusively
proved, during the recent controversies,
by Archbishop Dechamps,
Dom Guéranger, and various other
able writers.</p>

<p>The infallibility of the Pope is
implicitly contained in and logically
concluded from the infallibility of the
church in general, and of the teaching
hierarchy in particular, in substantially
the same way as it is in
the supremacy. The church is essentially
constituted by its fundamental
principle, which is that of organic
unity under one visible head, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
successor of St. Peter. The vital
force of this organic unity is faith,
and, as the body is infallible in faith,
and also governed by the head, the
head must be infallible in a higher
and more immediate sense; otherwise,
the body of the church would
be liable either to become corrupt in
faith by remaining united to a corrupted
head, or to cease to be a body
by separating from its head. If we
take the church as represented by
another similitude, it is founded, as a
building, on the Rock of Peter;
that is, the Roman Church and the
succession of Roman pontiffs. The
foundation must be stable and immovable
in faith, if the structure
resting upon it has this immovable
stability. So, also, the episcopal
hierarchy, whether dispersed or congregated
in a general council, must
remain in communion of faith and
doctrine with the Roman Church and
Pontiff. The Pope must sanction
their decrees, otherwise they are null
and void. Those bishops who separate
from the faith of the Roman
Pontiff, no matter how numerous
they may be, fall out of the communion
of the church and forfeit their
authority to teach. Evidently, therefore,
if the teaching hierarchy is infallible,
the rule and authority which
directs and governs it must be infallible.
If a pilot is placed on the
flag-ship of a fleet which has to pass
through a dangerous strait, and orders
are given to every ship to follow in
his wake, it is evident that the success
of the passage depends on the
unerring skill of the pilot. A fallible
head to an infallible hierarchy, a fallible
guide to an infallible church, a
fallible supreme teacher, a fallible
Vicar of Christ! What a contradiction
in terms! Who can believe that
our Lord Jesus Christ ever constituted
his church upon such inconsistent
principles? The supremacy
of the Pope and the infallibility of
the church plainly cannot coexist
with each other in fact, or be united
into a coherent whole in logic, without
the infallibility of the Pope as
the term of union. Yet these two
doctrines have always been the constitutive
principles of the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>It is, however, still requisite to
answer the question, how any doctrine
different from that defined by the
Council of the Vatican could have
existed and been tolerated so long
among Catholics, and how the church
could have postponed her definition
to this late period. When we say it
is requisite, we mean, merely, requisite
in order to complete the explanation
we promised to make. We
have no right to ask reasons of the
church, any more than of Almighty
God, as a preliminary to our submission.
We are to take with unquestioning
docility whatever instruction
the church gives us. Yet, we are
permitted to make investigation of
the truths of our religion, in order to
understand them better, to confirm
our belief, and to be ready to answer
objections. Therefore, we reply to
the question stated above, first, in
general terms, that the infallibility of
the Roman Pontiff has always been
held, taught, and acted on by the
supreme authority itself, and practically
acknowledged by all good Catholics;
and that its explicit definition
was delayed until the necessity and
expediency of such a definition was
made clearly manifest, and the fitting
occasion furnished by the providence
of God.</p>

<p>The argument will be made more
clear if we substitute the term <i>irreformable</i>
in the place of <i>infallible</i>.
All irreformable decrees are confessedly
infallible, and the question of
law and fact is therefore precisely
this: whether the Roman Pontiffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
have ever suffered their dogmatic
decrees to be judicially revised by
the bishops, or to remain suspended
as to their complete obligatory force,
until the express or tacit assent of
the bishops had been manifested;
and whether the church has ever recognized
any such right in the bishops.
So far as the Popes are concerned,
it is enough to refer to the
unquestionable fact that they have
expressly prohibited appeals from the
judgment of the Holy See to an
œcumenical council, from the time of
Celestine I. in the fifth century. Martin
V. and Pius II. in the fifteenth
century, Julius II. and Paul V. in
the sixteenth century, renewed this
prohibition. Clement XI., in the
eighteenth century, condemned the
Jansenists, who had appealed from
the Bull <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unigenitus</i> to a general
council, and pronounced sentence of
excommunication upon all who promoted
the appeal, unless they abandoned
it and subscribed to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Unigenitus</i>.
This sentence was a general
one, including all appeals from the
Holy See to an œcumenical council.
It was accepted by the whole church,
a small party of Jansenists only remaining
contumacious, and has been
incorporated into the canon law.
Moreover, the Holy See has always
required the bishops to receive and
promulgate without any judicial
examination, and without delay, all
its dogmatic judgments; and they
have submitted to this demand obediently,
even those who, like Bossuet,
have held Gallican opinions. The
most illustrious and irrefragable proof
of the doctrine of the universal episcopate
on this point which could be
given, was really given at the Council
of the Vatican. The monition at
the end of the constitution on faith,
which plainly declares the obligation
of entire submission to the doctrinal
decrees of the Holy See, was approved
by the unanimous vote of all the
fathers, including those belonging to
what was called the minority. The
Popes have always claimed and exercised
the office of supreme judges in
matters of faith, the episcopate and
the whole church consenting and
submitting, and all dissidents being
compelled to keep silence or incur
excommunication.</p>

<p>The definition of the Council of
the Vatican has not, therefore, conferred
any new rights on the Sovereign
Pontiff or enlarged their exercise. It
has only made an explicit statement
that the rights always possessed and
exercised by him are declared in the
divine revelation to belong to him
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">jure divino</i>, with the guarantee of infallibility
in their exercise, and proposed
this statement to all the faithful
with the obligation of receiving it
as a part of the Catholic faith.</p>

<p>It is not very difficult to give satisfactory
reasons why this was not
done before. The church does not
make definitions without a positive
reason. Ordinarily, she waits until
the truth is denied or disputed. Before
the Council of Constance, or
rather the period which immediately
preceded that council, the plenary
authority of the Pope had not been
called in question except by open
schismatics and heretics. We have
the authority of Gerson, the principal
author of Gallicanism, for the assertion
that any one who had advanced
his doctrine of the subjection of the
Pope to the council before that time,
would have been universally condemned
as a heretic. The Council of
Constance was a very irregular, abnormal,
and imperfect council, until
the election of Martin V. near its
close. It was rather a congress or
states-general of Christendom than
a council. The residence of the
popes at Avignon and the subsequent
division of Catholic Christendom into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
three obediences, had put the pontifical
authority in abeyance and diminished
the moral force of the Holy
See. The right and duty of putting
an end to this state of things,
and bringing the whole church under
the jurisdiction of one certain and
lawful head, had devolved by default
upon the bishops, aided by the influence
and authority of the princes,
and the counsel of the principal
theologians and priests of the time.
Harrassed and distracted by the difficulties
and dangers which beset the
church, a number of leading men
whose spirit and intention were good,
and who were devoted to the preservation
of Catholic unity, had fallen
into the grievous mistake of seeking
a remedy for existing and threatening
disorders in a limitation of the
sovereign authority of the Vicar of
Christ. Martin V. obviously did the
only thing prudent or even possible
for the moment, in leaving the irregular
and uncanonical decrees which
they had passed to die of their own
intrinsic weakness. His successor,
Eugenius IV., had too many open
and contumacious rebels and schismatics
to deal with, to permit him
to alienate those who had fallen into
minor errors, unawares, by a formal
condemnation. At the Council of
Florence, the reconciliation of the
Greeks and other Orientals to
the Holy See was the object of
paramount importance. At the
Fifth Council of Lateran and at
the Council of Trent, the fathers
were absorbed by questions of far
greater immediate necessity than that
of Gallicanism. Yet the Council of
Lateran came very near defining the
Papal infallibility, and the result of
the Council of Trent was to strengthen
the pontifical authority immensely,
as may be seen by reading the
history of its final confirmation and
promulgation, and examining the
bull of confirmation itself, which effectually
sweeps away every vestige
of the irregular legislation of Constance.
Between the Council of
Trent and the Council of the Vatican,
no other œcumenical council
intervened. The Gallican controversy,
as all know, chiefly raged during
the reign of Louis XIV. The
Pope refrained from any formal condemnation
of the Gallican tenets, although
urged even by that monarch
himself to terminate the controversy
by a final judgment; and, although
these opinions were held and advocated
by a certain number of Catholic
prelates and theologians from that
time until the Council of the Vatican,
they were never branded by any note
of censure by the Holy See. It may
seem surprising that such a patient
and cautious method of dealing with
errors which have at length been
condemned as heretical should have
been pursued; but any one who
knows the whole history of the matter
must admire the supernatural
wisdom of this course of conduct.
One motive, doubtless, for it, was respect
for Bossuet. But another and
more powerful reason was that the
Holy See desired to gain a victory
by the means of discussion and argument,
before reverting to the exercise
of authority.</p>

<p>And again, it is obvious at first
sight that a far greater moral weight
has been given to the final definition,
by the fact that the Sovereign Pontiffs
have left the solemn and decisive
deliberation and judgment of a matter
which relates to their own highest
and most sublime prerogative, to
the bishops of the church assembled
in a general council. It may appear
strange to some that the church
could tolerate an error even for a
time. But there is a great difference
between those errors which subvert
the foundation and rule of faith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
those which only shake them a little.
The errors of the Jansenists, Febronians,
and other rebels against the
authority of the Holy See, were of
the first class, and were never tolerated.
But the Gallicans of the school
of Bossuet recognized and practised
the duty of obedience to the Holy
See. Their error lay rather in an illogical,
indistinct, and imperfect conception
of the supreme authority of
the Roman Pontiff, than in a denial
of any of its attributes. They admitted
the right of the Pope to issue
dogmatic judgments, and the obligation
of bishops and the faithful to receive
them with interior assent and
obedience. They acknowledged
that these judgments became judgments
of the Catholic Church, and
were made irreformable as soon as
the assent of a majority of the bishops
was even tacitly given. As
this assent has always been given,
not tacitly alone, but by the most
formal and express adhesion, there
has never been any practical divergence
in doctrine between orthodox
Gallicans and the more consistent
Ultramontanes. St. Augustine himself
had said that it is sometimes the
wisest course to tolerate for a time
the errors of those who hold the faith
firmly, and err only by an imperfect
knowledge and a confused conception
of the truth. The church has
not hesitated or faltered in regard to
her own principles, or failed to act
on them with full and distinct consciousness.
But it is not always necessary
for her to propose them fully
and completely as articles of divine
and Catholic faith to her children.
It is for the church, guided, illuminated,
governed, and assisted by the
Holy Spirit, to judge of the time and
manner in which she will unfold and
display in all their brilliant majesty
the treasures of her doctrine. She
has waited until the nineteenth century
to encircle the brow of the
Queen of Heaven with the coronet
of her definition of the Immaculate
Conception, and to place in the tiara
of the Vicar of Christ a new jewel
by defining his infallibility. From
both these splendid acts, in which
her divine authority, her irresistible
power, her infallible wisdom, and her
miraculous unity are manifested with
the most radiant lustre, incalculable
blessings will flow in abundance upon
her faithful children. Christ is honored
in his Mother and in his Vicar.
The serpent's head is crushed anew.
Faith triumphs in her new conquests.
The kingdom of God is strengthened
and consolidated, and the kingdom
of Satan is shaken to its foundations.
Like the cathedral of Cologne, the
superb edifice of theology approaches
to its completion, the new marble
rises side by side with that which is
dimmed by the dust of ages, and
new pinnacles are placed upon ancient
foundations. This temple is
one whose builder and maker is not
man but God, whose designs are
formed in eternity, but realized gradually
and successively in time.
From the foundation to the top-stone,
the massive solidity, the symmetry
and unity of plan, the harmony
of proportions, the perfection of
beauty, which become more clearly
evident with every century, disclose
the idea in the infinite mind of the
Supreme Architect. The Catholic
Church has been designed and constructed
by the same being who designed
and constructed the universe.
As the solar system is unerring and
unfailing in its movements, prescribed
to it by the immutable law of its
Creator, so is the church unerring
and unfailing by the law of its divine
Founder. And as the sun can never
cease to be the unfailing source of
light and heat, and the immovable
centre of revolution, while the solar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
system endures, so the See of Peter
must remain the centre and the
source of truth, doctrine, law, unity,
and perpetual movement to the Catholic
Church, so long as time endures.
It is this unerring stability of
the Catholic Church in the law prescribed
by its founder, Jesus Christ,
which is properly termed infallibility;
and, since this stability is communicated
to all the distant and dependent
churches under her obedience
by the Roman Church, it is in the
Roman Church that infallibility has
its immovable seat and centre.</p>

<p>It is plain from the foregoing argument
how false and flimsy is the
pretence of Dr. Döllinger, M. Loyson,
and the other rebels against the
Council of the Vatican, that they
have been excommunicated for adhering
to the old Catholic faith which
they have always held. All heretics
have said the same thing, except
those who have openly averred that
they reject the authority of the Catholic
Church. This is what the
Arians said, and Arius knew how to
play the injured, persecuted saint
and prophet of God, even better than
M. Loyson. The creed of Nice is a
new creed, said the Arians and Semi-Arians.
So said the rebels against
the Councils of Constantinople, Ephesus,
and Chalcedon. The little Jansenist
sect in Holland calls itself the
Old Catholic Church, and its members
take the name of Old Catholics.
The allegation is palpably and ridiculously
false. The Gallican opinions
were never a part of the Catholic
doctrine. The highest claim that
could ever be made for them by their
advocates was, that they were probable
opinions not condemned by the
supreme authority. The best theologians
have condemned them as erroneous
and proximate to heresy.
The Holy See has never shown them
the slightest favor, but, on the contrary,
has used all means, except that
of express condemnation, to drive
them out of seminaries, to destroy
their credit, and to inculcate the true
and sound doctrine. They were tolerated
errors. While they were tolerated,
it was possible for good Catholics,
and even learned men, to
hold them in good faith; since good
and learned men, and even prelates,
are fallible interpreters of both Scripture
and tradition, and may err in
reasoning and judgment. But their
temporary toleration gave them no
rights, not even those which belong
to received opinions of Catholic
schools of theology. There were
good reasons for a purely passive toleration
for a time. But none for
the indefinite continuance of such
toleration. The silence of an œcumenical
council, viewing all the
events which had occurred during
the past two centuries, would have
given the advocates of Gallicanism a
plausible pretext to claim for it a
positive toleration, a recognition of
its real and solid probability. Moreover,
it was reviving under a new
and more dangerous form; numbers
of good and loyal Catholics were beginning
to go astray after a so-called
Catholic liberalism, and a clique of
secret traitors was plotting a revolt
against the Holy See, disguised under
the ambiguities and reservations
of Gallicanism. Error, though it
may lie dormant and not show its
dangerous character for a time, sooner
or later works out the conclusions
contained in its premises. Gallicanism
was an illogical doctrine, containing
implicitly the denial of the
papal supremacy. It was necessary,
therefore, to condemn it, and to define
the truth. Those who gave up
their opinions in obedience to the decree
of the Vatican acted like Catholics,
and like reasonable and consistent
men. As Catholics, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
bound to obey a divine authority.
As reasonable men, they were bound
to abandon an opinion which they
had embraced on merely probable
grounds, as soon as the certain truth
was made known to them.</p>

<p>Moreover, the malcontents were
taught from their childhood, and
some of them have themselves taught,
as authors and professors, the infallibility
of œcumenical councils as a
doctrine of the Catholic faith. They
have renounced, abjured, and trampled
on that faith, by rebelling against
the Council of the Vatican, and bidding
defiance to the authority of their
bishops and of the Pope. They are
justly excommunicated. The anathema
of the church has smitten
them, and they are doomed to wither
and die, and go into oblivion.
As for the Catholic Church and her
docile children, they have made a
great act of faith which has had a
most salutary effect already, in
strengthening the habit of divine
faith, and in illuminating the intellect
with the knowledge of the truth.
Its salutary effects in the future will
be still greater. There was never a
time when the continuous and immediate
exercise of the supreme teaching
authority of the Vicar of Christ
was so necessary and so easy as the
present critical, momentous period.
Never a time when it was so necessary
for all the faithful to place an absolute
and boundless confidence in
the chair of Peter. God has made
known to all men, as a truth of his
divine revelation, the infallibility
of that chair, and of his august
Vicar who sits in it. This truth is
equally certain with the greatest mysteries
of the faith, the Trinity and
the Incarnation. This chair of Peter
can neither be deceived nor deceive
us, for its doctrine rests on the veracity
of the Holy Spirit, the author
of truth, and in believing and obeying
it we believe and obey Almighty
God.</p>

<h2>A PILGRIMAGE TO CAYLA.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></h2>



<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Cayla</span>, August 1, 1867.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>: In pressing
my hand for the last time, when I
left Quebec two months ago, you
said, "Do not fail to visit Cayla." I
made you the promise, and to-day I
accomplish it. It is from the chamber
itself of Eugénie de Guérin that I
write.</p>

<p>You who have such an avowed
admiration for the sister of Maurice,
with what rapture you will enjoy the
minute details which I have to communicate!
How many times have
we asked, after having read the admirable
<cite>Journal</cite> of Eugénie, after
having lived with her the life at Cayla,
what had become of that domestic
life which she described with such
exquisite art, and which she caused
us to love so much? Who are now
the actual inmates of that antique
château? If "Mimi," sweet "Mimi,"
is still living? etc. To all these
questions I can to-day reply. On
my return to Poitiers from a short
visit to the little city of Airvault, the
cradle of my ancestors, I turned my
steps toward Toulouse, where I arrived
this morning. The entire city
was in a state of festivity, the streets
were all decorated, and filled with
pilgrims, flags waved in every direction,
and the façades of the houses
were hung with wreaths of flowers.
They were celebrating the last day
of the grand <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i> in honor of St. Germaine
Cousin.</p>

<p>The railroad which runs from Toulouse
to Alby stops at Gaillac, and
there branches off to the station
of Tessounières. Leaving Alby to
the right, I came down to Cahuzac
about two o'clock. The terminus is
about half a league from the village.
I was obliged to make this little trip
on foot, in company with the mail-carrier,
who also took charge of my
valise.</p>

<p>The landscape is hilly and abrupt,
and has a savage aspect. The road
winds through the valley, rises and
descends between the wooded mountains,
whence peep out here and
there some white rocks which indicate
a sterile soil.</p>

<p>At a turn in the road, I perceived
on an acclivity Cahuzac, whose name
vibrates so pleasantly on the ears of
Eugénie. From there a carriage
conducted me in a few moments to
Andillac, a village more than modest,
which appeared on my left, with its
poor little church, where repose the
tombs of Maurice and Eugénie, where
she came so often to pray, to weep,
to hope, to implore with many tears
the salvation of her brother.</p>

<p>Here the road turns off and climbs
a hillside. The guide pointed with his
finger across the trees on the other
side of the ravine to the Château of
Cayla, which rises isolated on a
graceful eminence. 'Tis a spacious
mansion of severe aspect. Nothing
distinguishes it from ordinary structures,
except a little tower built on
one of its angles, which gives it a
slightly feudal tinge. Notwithstanding
the unobtrusiveness of this manor
when seen in its landscape-framing,
the effect is laughing and picturesque,
thanks to the prestige of
poetry, that fairy enchantress who has
touched every object in this domain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
with her golden ring. Here, though
the fairy is an angel, it is Eugénie.</p>

<p>The carriage crossed the ravine,
and followed the banks of the St.
Usson, a little stream which turns
the parish mill. It then began the
steep ascent to Cayla, and finally
stopped before the farm, in the midst
of a crowd of chickens, who were
cackling and disporting themselves,
in the sun, on a litter of straw. A
servant came up at that moment
from the rabbit-warren on the north
side, and politely invited me into the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salon</i>, a pretty enough room, opening
on the terrace. Some furniture
in modern style, white curtains, some
wax fruit and flowers, a few paintings
on the walls, a little picture of Cayla
and its surroundings, on the table
a handsome edition of the works of
Eugénie and Maurice; this last the
most beautiful ornament of this
home.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a young
lady with a distinguished air and
dreamy expression entered. It was
Caroline de Guérin, Eugénie's niece,
that dear little "Caro" whom she
used to rock on her knees, now married
to M. Melchior Mâzuc, of a noble
and wealthy family of Montpellier.
She was soon followed by another
person, much older but still
sprightly, dressed very humbly, with
an expression of extreme sweetness
in her countenance, and a modesty
yet more lovely, with marked features,
lit up by her bright eyes, and a smile
uniting extreme delicacy and benevolence.</p>

<p>I introduced myself as coming from
America, from Canada, attracted to
this remote corner of France by the
fame of Eugénie.</p>

<p>"Has the reputation of our Eugénie
reached that far?" exclaimed
Marie de Guérin, for it was she.</p>

<p>From this moment the conversation
did not languish, fed, as it was,
by the thousand nothings around
which the halo of poetry has been
thrown by the author of the <cite>Journal</cite>.</p>

<p>Just as I rose to take my leave,
M. Mâzuc entered, followed by
Madame de Guérin, the widow of
Erembert. They had summoned M.
Mâzuc from the fields, where he had
been superintending his vinedressers.
He is a man in the strength of age,
an old officer in the army of Algiers,
with a manly face, energetic look,
amiable and impulsive character.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed he. "You
come all the way from America and
as far as our mountains to visit us,
and already talk of leaving? No,
no; you must not think of such a
thing. You have not seen anything
yet; you must stay and visit the
neighborhood, and we will give you
Eugénie's room, and you will find it
just as it was at the time of the
<cite>Journal</cite>. Then, here is my brother
Nérestan, who has just returned
from Africa, where he filled the office
of officer of colonization; he will entertain
you about Algiers, and you
can talk to him of Canada."</p>

<p>"Oh! very well," said M. Nérestan,
shaking me cordially by the
hand; "and I will begin at once by
telling you that the best system of
colonization that I know of, I found
in a book printed in Canada which
accidentally fell into my hands."</p>

<p>They all then urged me with so
much politeness to stay that, conquered
by their kind persuasions, I
yielded to the pleasure of remaining.</p>

<p>While awaiting tea, Marie equipped
herself without any ceremony in
an old straw hat with a broad brim,
and invited me to take a walk and
visit the environs. We were already
old acquaintances. We went out by
the door that opens on the terrace,
which rests on the crest of the ravine.
Along the wall grew several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
pomegranate-trees, and some jasmine
in bloom, from which Maurice
gathered a bouquet the day before
his death. He walked down here,
leaning on the arm of Eugénie, to
warm in the bright sun his limbs
already struck with the chill of death,
to bathe his panting breast in the
pure warm morning air, and to contemplate
for the last time the beautiful
sky of Cayla.</p>

<p>Some stone steps lead to the bottom
of the ravine, where the little
stream runs along, shaded by willows,
whose rippling has so often caused
that amiable recluse to dream and
sing in her little chamber. Here is
the fountain of Téoulé, that is to say,
of the Tile, so-called from the huge
tile which serves as a reservoir for
the water from the rock. We crossed
the Pontet which leads to the
laundry, where, like the beautiful
Nausicaa of old, Eugénie came sometimes
to wash her robes; and which
inspired these pretty reflections:</p>

<p>"A day passed in drying one's
linen leaves but little to say. It is,
however, pretty enough to spread
out a nice white wash on the grass,
or to see it waving from the lines.
You can be, if you wish, either the
Nausicaa of Homer, or one of the
princesses of the Bible who washed
the tunics of their brothers. We
have a laundry that you have not seen,
at the Moulinasse, large enough and
full of water, which embellishes this
recess, and attracts the birds, who
love the coolness to sing in. I write
you with clean hands, having just
returned from washing a dress in the
stream. 'Tis delightful to wash, and
see the fish pass, the little waves, bits
of grass, and fallen flowers, to follow
this, that, and I know not what in
the thread of the stream! So many
things are seen by the laundress who
knows how to look in the course of
the stream! 'Tis the bathing-place
of the birds, the mirror of heaven,
the image of life, a hidden path, a
baptismal reservoir."</p>

<p>A few steps in the meadow, a
superb chestnut-tree, three or four
centuries old, spreads its vast shade;
old sentinel of the château, which
has seen born and die the generations
of De Guérins. The ridge of
Sept-Fonds winds through the trees
as far as the top of the hill; on the
neighboring declivity is the little coppice
of Buis, with its pretty little
pathway, full of shade and mystery,
and where Eugénie had her little dog
buried.</p>

<p>"<i>July 1st.</i>&mdash;He is dead, my poor
little dog. I am so sad, I have but
little inclination to write.</p>

<p>"<i>July 2d.</i>&mdash;I have just put Bijou
in the warren of the coppice, among
the flowers and birds. I am going
to plant a rose-bush there, and call
it the <i>dog-rose</i>. I have kept his two
little front paws, which so often rested
on my hands, on my feet, on my
knees. He was so nice, so graceful
when he lay down, and in his caresses!
In the morning he used to come
to the foot of my bed, to lick my
feet as I was getting up; then went
to give papa the same greeting. We
were his two favorites. All this comes
back to me now. Past objects go to the
heart. Papa regrets him as much as
I do; he said he would have given
ten sheep for this poor little dog.
Alas! everything must leave us, or
we must leave everything.</p>

<p>"A letter just received has caused
me another pang. The affections of
the heart differ like their objects.
What a difference the grief for Bijou,
and that for a soul being lost, or at
least in danger of it! O my God!
how frightful that is in the eyes of
faith!"</p>

<p>Passing before the farm, we cast
a glance at the other side of the valley.
Facing us, this mass of green is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
the Bois du Pigimbert, with the hamlet
of Pausadon, where Vialarette
lived, that poor woman whom Marie
and her sister used to visit. More
to the left, on the heights, is the village
of Mérix, and below, toward the
north, Leutin, where Eugénie went
so frequently to hear Mass.</p>

<p>The road from the warren of the
north skirts the base of the hill,
which extends itself in the rear of
the old castle. Here, as elsewhere,
all is full of souvenirs.</p>

<p class="center">
"Every tree has its history, every stone a name."<br />
</p>

<p>Here Maurice played with his
sisters among the branches of the
Treilhon, that old vine-stalk which
twines itself round the trunk of an
oak-tree. "Mimi" smiled at the recollection
of the slides they used to
take down the side of the ravine.
She pointed out a little underwood
of maples; they were small trees
about the thickness of one's arm,
and which have nothing in common
with the king of our forests.</p>

<p>A sudden storm coming up obliged
us to seek shelter in the mansion.
A few moments before, the
sky was serene and blue; now all
was obscured by clouds, the rain
came down in torrents, and it began
to thunder and lighten. This southern
sky always reminds me of a great
child, changing from smiles to tears
with a wonderful facility.</p>

<p>At half-past seven, supper was
announced, at which was served the
excellent wine of Cayla. At the side
of its father, was little Mâzuc de
Guérin, a child of eighteen months.
Oh! that Eugénie could have caressed
this child of "Caro's."</p>

<p>The evening passed delightfully;
anecdotes were told, reminiscences
of Cayla, of America, of Algeria,
and episodes related by M. Mâzuc
of the wars in Africa, in the mountains
of Kabylia. "Mimi" then brought
us back to our present surroundings
by relating some interesting details
of the widow of Maurice. She returned
from India after the death of
her husband, and died at Bordeaux
in 1861.</p>

<p>And the good M. Bories is still
living, but struck with a cruel malady,
and is but a mere wreck.</p>

<p>At bedtime I was conducted to
my room. A spiral staircase ascends
to the principal story, and leads into
the great hall. This is the stately and
solemn apartment of the manor. In
it a vast fireplace, whose mantel is
sustained by caryatides in stone; on
either side are the figures of two cavaliers
in their armor, rudely sketched.
In former days these walls were
covered with the armor of the seignors
of this house; this inlaid floor,
to-day so silent, resounded to the
footsteps of armed knights, carrying
on the points of their lances standards
and pennons on which the ladies
of the castle had embroidered
the proud device of the sires of De
Guérin. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omni exceptione majores.</i>
It was in this saloon, now so deserted,
that they armed themselves to
fight against the Moors and the ferocious
Albigenses, or where they
donned their richest armor, their
brilliant helmets of finest steel, and
their gilded breast-plates, to cross
their lances in the tournament. At
the time of Eugénie, all this antique
splendor had long since passed away.
Here as elsewhere, the Revolution had
reaped its harvest of destruction, and
the rich Seignors de Guérin "were
now," said she, "only poor squires,
striving to keep the wolf from the
door."</p>

<p>On the right side of the hall is
a door opening into the chamber of
"Mimi;" on the left, one opening into
that of Maurice. At the extreme
end, away back, retired like a cell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
hidden like the nest of a bird, is the
little room of Eugénie. It is in this
room, and on her table, that I am
now writing to you, surrounded by
the same silence, and lit by the same
modest light of her lamp. Before
me is her little chapel in miniature,
her crucifix, her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">étagère</i> of books.
Nothing besides this, neither ornaments
nor luxury; nothing except the
most commonplace. But these valueless
nothings have become relics;
this little room a chapel, this table
an altar. 'Twas from this white and
peaceful cage that the dove of Cayla
flew away to the land of dreams,
gathered the celestial flowers of poetry,
conversed with the angels, and
sang with her heart. It is here that
she prayed, read, wrote her <cite>Journal</cite>,
and those admirable letters to Louise
de Bayne, Madame de Maistre, and
Maurice; 'tis here that she wrote her
heart's history, that she lived, that
she died; from here that she went to
rejoin Maurice.</p>

<p>I turned over the leaves of the
<cite>Journal</cite>, and gave myself up to its
fascinations, where the least object,
an insect that flies, a bird that sings,
a ray of light penetrating the blinds,
inspired her with those charming
thoughts, those poetical pages, like a
harmony of Lamartine, fine and profound
as a passage of La Rochefoucauld.
Her thoughts take at times
the most unexpected flights, sublime
transports, like an elevation of Bossuet's.</p>

<p>Never perhaps has there been a
more delicate organization, a more
susceptible imagination. Her soul
was like an Æolian harp which vibrates
to the slightest breath.</p>

<p>Mlle. de Guérin wrote with a golden
pen. I would compare her to
Madame Sévigné, if Madame Sévigné
was less frivolous. The latter amuses
and dazzles, the former captivates
and touches; the one is as bright as
a lark, the other dreamy as a dove.
The first has more genius, the second
more soul. There is more sentimentality
in Madame de Sévigné, in Eugénie
de Guérin more sentiment.
The writings of one skim over the
surface of the soul, those of the other
penetrate it. We can admire Madame
de Sévigné, we love Eugénie
de Guérin.</p>

<p>Before me, hanging to the framework
of her library, is a picture of
St. Thérèse de Gérard, a present to
her from the Baroness de Rivières.
I re-read the passage suggested by
this little engraving, those aspirations
toward contemplative life, which reveal
such tender piety, such deep
and true devotion. This pure heart
turned naturally toward heaven, like
the mariner's needle, which always
points to the north. "She was of
those souls," said Mgr. Mermillod,
"who in the midst of our material
cares hear the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sursum Corda</i> of the
Holy Church, and who delight in
these noble and holy aspirations."
"We can make a church everywhere,"
says she in some of her writings.</p>

<p>I open the window, and, like her,
I contemplate the beautiful night&mdash;the
country half-buried in shadows,
the myriads of stars, which, like golden
nails, sustain the blue tapestry of
heaven. All is silence, meditation,
mystery; a single murmur, that of
the stream.</p>

<p>It sings for me, as it formerly did
for Eugénie. In looking back into
the past, I ask myself if I have ever
spent a sweeter hour or experienced
more vivid emotions.</p>

<p>Adieu, it is midnight. Expect soon
a sequel to this letter.</p>

<p>To <span class="smcap">M. l'Abbé L.</span>, Quebec.</p>



<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>, August 9, 1867.</p>


<p>... At five o'clock in the morning,
I heard a knock at my door. I was
already up. The previous evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
I had made an arrangement with
Mlle. de Guérin to go to Andillac,
where I wished to say Mass, and visit
the graves of Maurice and Eugénie.</p>

<p>The cheerful aspect of nature
seemed to echo the brightness of my
thoughts. The heights of Mérix
were bathed in the rosy hues of
morning; in the sky appeared the
first golden threads of the sun; in
the plain the slight fragrance of the
dew, perfumed breezes, and the warbling
of the birds.</p>

<p>We saluted in passing the little
cross where the brother and sister
took such a tender adieu of each
other, where Eugénie preserved so
long the impression that the horse's
foot made in the plastic soil. One
Christmas Eve, going to midnight
Mass, she gathered, in her simple
piety, some branches covered with
hoar-frost from the bushes which grow
along this road, which she wished to
place before the Blessed Sacrament&mdash;a
scene which she described with so
much freshness and charming grace:</p>

<p>"We all went to midnight Mass,
papa in advance&mdash;the night was superb.
Never had there been a more
beautiful midnight, so much so that
papa put his head out from his mantle
several times to look at the firmament.
The ground was covered with
hoar-frost, but we did not feel the
cold, and then the air was warmed
in front of us by the torches which
our servants carried to light the way.
It was charming, I assure you, and
I only wish you could have been
with us, going to church along these
roads bordered with little bushes, as
white as if they were all in bloom.
The hoar-frost makes beautiful flowers.
We saw a branch so lovely that
we wished to make a bouquet for
the Blessed Sacrament, but it melted
in our hand. All flowers are short-lived.
I regretted my bouquet: it
was sad to see it melt, and dissolve
drop by drop."</p>

<p>Going along, Mlle. de Guérin told
me of the last sickness and death of
her sister. Two years before, her
health became seriously affected; it
was in vain that the physician sent
her to the waters of Cauterets, to
seek the strength which would never
more return.</p>

<p>She felt her end approaching; but
she did not tremble; in her complete
resignation, there was no place for
fear. As she watched the span of
life gradually diminish, she seemed
to fold within herself, like the sensitive
plant; wrapped around her the
mantle of holy recollection, in which
great souls envelope themselves at
the approach of that supreme contemplation
which she foresaw. She
talked but little, prayed much, and
smiled rarely. Her little room had
become the cell of a religious; she
lived there cloistered, only leaving it
to go to church. Prayer was her recreation,
the Holy Eucharist her
food.</p>

<p>"I wish to die after having received
the holy communion," said
she a short time before her death.
They noticed that she looked often
toward Andillac, where she was going
so soon to dwell. The swallow
is compelled to fly away on the eve
of winter; the winter of death was
approaching.</p>

<p>She took cold going to Mass on
the Epiphany, and returned home
with a fever, which increased rapidly.
Inflammation of the lungs supervened,
which hurried her to the portal
of death in a few days. After
having received the holy Viaticum,
"I can die now," sighed she with a
celestial smile. "Adieu, my dear
Marie!" And as she felt the tears
tremble in her eyes, at seeing her so
overcome with grief, she embraced
her, and said, while turning her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
away to conceal her emotion, "Ah!
do not let us be sad!" as if she was
afraid of weakening the generosity
of her sacrifice.</p>

<p>Such was the appointed end of
Mlle. Eugénie de Guérin. She died
like a saint, "as the angels would
die, if they were not immortals," said
one of her friends.</p>

<p>We arrived at Andillac.</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mosou Ritou</i>"&mdash;M. le Curé&mdash;"is
he in the rectory?" asked Mlle. de
Guérin in patois of the old servant,
as she entered with the familiarity
of an habituée.</p>

<p>M. l'Abbé Massol welcomed us cordially,
and conversed with me about a
project which he had had in view for
some time of rebuilding the church
of Andillac with the offerings of the
admirers of Eugénie de Guérin. The
encouraging sympathy which he had
received led him to hope that he
would very soon be able to accomplish
his purpose, which will be the
honor of the tomb of this pious young
girl, and her aureola by choice: this
was indeed the only glory that she
desired.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The actual church of Andillac is
really nothing more than a ruin. Its
tottering belfry, roof falling in from
age, cracked and crumbling walls,
present the picture of desolation. It
is necessary to descend several steps
in order to enter this other Bethlehem,
whose sombre, decayed, and
humid aspect sends a chill to the
heart. Nothing less than the most
ardent faith, or Eugénie's happy imagination,
could enable a person to
breathe in what seems more like a
charnel-house than a church, or
cause a ray of brightness and poetry
to enter there.</p>

<p>I whispered to Mlle. Guérin that I
was going to say Mass for the illustrious
dead of her family; and I had
the happiness of giving the holy
communion to the sister of Eugénie.
A quarter of an hour passed in
thanksgiving on the prie-dieu where
she used to kneel left an impression
never to be forgotten; angel, she
conversed here with the angels, with
the Spouse of virgins; she unfolded
here to the wind of eternity those
wings of light which detached her
every day more and more from the
earth, and which have finally transported
her to the bosom of our
Lord.</p>

<p>On leaving the church, Mlle. de
Guérin silently opened the gate of
the cemetery. I was face to face
with the beloved graves. The morning
sunlight flooded this garden of
the dead, as if to remind me of that
other invisible light which illumines
the other shore of life that never
fades. A shaft of white marble, the
only monument in the cemetery,
marks the grave of Maurice. We
read distinctly the mournful date,
<i>July 19, 1839</i>. At the side to the
right is a simple wooden cross, one
of its arms supporting a crown of
immortelles, with this inscription enclosed
in a medallion: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eugénie de Guérin</i>,
May 31, 1848. In the rear were
two iron crosses, one of them marking
the grave of M. Joseph de Guérin,
Eugénie's father, and the other
that of Erembert. They died a year
apart, 1850 and 1851.</p>

<p>I remained a long time on my
knees beside the grave of Eugénie,
in the same place where, overwhelmed
by a nameless grief, she wept torrents
of tears, where she probed that
terrible mystery of death, fathomless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
as her sorrow; and whence she rose
at last, crushed for ever, but resigned,
with this sublime cry of a Christian,
"Let us throw our hearts into eternity!"
She sleeps now by the side
of that dear Maurice for whom she
often wept, until the day when they
will rise together never more to be
separated.</p>

<p>Before leaving, Mlle. de Guérin
gathered a bouquet of roses and immortelles
from her sister's grave,
placed it in my hands, and went out,
without uttering a word.</p>

<p>Adieu, sweet and <i>blessed Eugénie</i>!
The glory which you did not seek
has sought you, but the aureola
which shines over your mausoleum
need not alarm your modesty or your
humility. It is pure as your soul,
sweet as your nature, religious as
your thoughts, benevolent as your
life. Already it has illumined more
than one soul, and strengthened
more than one heart. It will do
more: it will rebuild this temple,
whence will arise in your honor the
hymn of gratitude. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pertransiit benefaciendo!</i></p>

<p>On my return to Cayla, I thanked
my kind hosts for their gracious hospitality,
commended myself to the
prayers of Marie, <i>the holy</i>, and resumed
the route to Toulouse.</p>

<p>I have brought you several souvenirs
from Cayla, some drawings, one
of Eugénie's autographs, a few flowers,
and a bunch of immortelles,
which will be relics for you.</p>

<p>Since my return to Canada, several
pleasant little parcels have been
sent me from Cayla, among them
three different views of the château, a
map of the parish of Andillac, a photograph
of the church, and of the
cemetery in which are the graves of
Maurice and Eugénie, the likenesses
of Maurice, Marie, and Caroline de
Guérin.</p>

<p>The only picture which exists of
Eugénie is a simple pen-and-ink
sketch, scarcely outlined, which was
sent me by the editor of Eugénie's
works, M. Trébutien.</p>

<p>Among these precious souvenirs
from Cayla, I must also mention an
unpublished letter from Henry V.,
Count de Chambord, and another
from Cardinal de Villecourt, without
counting those addressed to me by
Marie de Guérin, several of which
would not do discredit to the collection
of Eugénie's. I will only cite
from one of them a short passage
in which she alludes to our young
Canadian Zouaves:</p>

<p>"I am so edified to see the devotion
of the Canadians to our Holy
Father the Pope. Your young men
leave for Rome, as did the crusaders
of old, for Palestine, at this word,
<i>God wills it</i>. Let us hope that this
plenitude of generosity will not be
without a happy result. Already
they have given an example at Mentana;
if necessary they will repeat it...."&mdash;<i>Letter
dated January
30, 1868.</i></p>


<p class="center">LETTER FROM HENRY V., COUNT DE
CHAMBORD.</p>


<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Frohsdorf</span>, June 19, 1864.</p>


<p>I recollect, mademoiselle, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
read several years ago, with much interest,
some remarkable extracts from
the works of M. Maurice de Guérin, a
young writer cut down in the flower
of his age and talents. I could not,
then, fail to welcome with a peculiar
satisfaction the book of Mlle. Eugénie
de Guérin, faithful mirror in
which is so constantly reflected the
twofold affection that filled her life&mdash;the
love of God and her tenderness
for her brother, sweet lesson and
touching example of that ardent,
lively, and resigned faith which, in
the midst of the sorrows of this
world, only finds consolation in
looking toward heaven, where those
whom we love here below, separated
from us in an instant by death, are
united again never more to be parted.
I must not defer any longer saying
to you how much I appreciate this
gift, and, above all, the pious motive
which prompted it&mdash;as well as the
expressions of devotion and attachment
with which it was accompanied,
in your name, as well as in that
of your sister-in-law. To M. Trébutien
and his daughter I beg you
will also express my gratitude.</p>

<p>Accept for yourself, with many
thanks, the assurance of my very
sincere sentiments.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF YORKE.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.<br />

TWO YEARS AFTER</h3>

<p>A heavy heart is a wonderful assistant
in acquiring repose of manner,
it weighs so on the impulses and
desires, and thus keeps them in order&mdash;fortunately
for Mrs. Jane Rowan.
On the whole, she behaved very
well in her new situation, and did
not fret herself nor the family too
much. By the gentleman of the
house and his daughter she was not
treated as a hired servant, but as Mr.
Williams's sister might have been
treated, if he had had one to take
charge of his establishment. With
the sister-in-law, Mrs. Bond, and the
servants, it was otherwise. The former
was one of those persons who
merit pity, from the fact that they
can never feel the delight of a generous
emotion. She worshipped the
guinea's stamp, but the preciousness
of fine gold she knew not: for her,
the guinea might as well have been
made of copper. If she had been
born to a servile estate, she would
have remained there, and adorned
her position; but she had been associated
with persons of respectability
and even of eminence. The advantages
of this association she showed
in that the arrogance with which she
treated her supposed inferiors was
cold and quiet, and her subservience
to her acknowledged superiors had
an air of personal fondness.</p>

<p>This woman's greatest fear was
lest some one should marry her brother-in-law,
in consequence of which
she labored incessantly to remove
from him all dangerous acquaintances:
her second source of terror was
that her niece might be captivated
by some ineligible person, and the
result was that every hovering monsieur
and professor who assisted in
educating the young woman was
watched as if he had been a pick-pocket.
Helen Williams used to
complain bitterly to the housekeeper
of this espionage, and Mrs. Bond
used as strenuously to invoke the
aid of the housekeeper in watching;
so that the unfortunate woman was
between two fires, and scorched pro
and con. But the great trial of her
life was the servants. Over these
potentates she was supposed to exercise
some authority, and for some
of their doings she was held responsible;
but the fact was that they
laughed her to scorn. As to commanding
them, Mrs. Rowan would
as soon have thought of commanding
the lancers or the cadets, and
indeed the lancers or the cadets would
quite as soon have thought of obeying
her. But through all these mean
annoyances, thanks to sorrow, the
quieter, she walked with a gentle
patience which saved her from serious
hurt.</p>

<p>Happily, the person on whom her
fortunes most depended put her quite
at ease in his regard. Mr. Williams
was moderately kind, not expressively
polite, and did not scruple to make
her useful. He had also certain habits
which soothed her sense of inferiority,
since she did not consider
them polite: he reached across the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
table sometimes in a shocking manner
to help himself, he bolted his
food when he was in haste, he smoked
a pipe in the sitting-room without
asking leave, and, while smoking, habitually
assumed a position contrary
to the apparent intention of nature,
by placing his feet higher than his
head. There were times when the
housekeeper dared to think that she
was almost as much a lady as Mr.
Williams was a gentleman. But she
liked him all the better for his deficiencies.
She liked him, too, for the
interest he took in her son.</p>

<p>In the fall, Mr. Williams and Major
Cleaveland had entered into partnership,
and enlarged their shipping
interests, and the former had said to
Mrs. Rowan of Dick, "If the boy
continues to do well, we must give
him a ship."</p>

<p>The mother's heart beat high. In
two years Dick would come back,
and then perhaps Mr. Williams would
remember his promise. That her son
would deserve such favor she never
doubted. Young Mr. Rowan had
the power of inspiring every one who
knew him with entire confidence. So
the mother set herself to endure and
count away the months to the coming
home of her son. The winter
melted, and spring came&mdash;six months
nearer! The summer glowed, and
grew chilly into autumn&mdash;only a year
longer! A second winter wore itself
away&mdash;but six months left! and what
you can have back again in six
months, you touch already. Six
months is only twenty-four weeks;
and, while you are counting them, the
four have slipped away. What signifies
five months? One sleeps
through nearly a third of them, which
leaves three months of conscious
waiting. Hearts do not count fractions.
Three months&mdash;and now they
begin to drag. It is July, and that
month has so many days, and the
days have so many hours in them,
and the hours are so long. You begin
to fancy that heat dilates time as
well as metals. You say that it is
just your luck that the only time in
the year when two months in succession
have thirty-one days should be
precisely this time. Good-by to July!
I would have spoken you more
courteously, O month of Cæsar! had
you not stood between my friend and
me. Not Cæsar's self may do that!
Two months now; but much may
happen in that time: kingdoms have
been lost and won in less. Fade, O
summer flowers! for ye can bloom
again when love is dead. Hasten,
O fruitful autumn! and bring the
harvest long waited for. The weeks
grow less, and only one is left; but
you dare not rejoice; so much may
happen in a week! Days roll round
with an audible jar, as if you heard
the earth buzz on her axis, and only
one is left. O God! how much may
happen in a day! The pendulum
swings entangled in your heart-strings,
the minutes march like armed men.
Merciful Father! hearts have broken
in a minute. Yes; but hearts that
were sinking have grown glad in a
minute, shall grow glad, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deo volente</i>.
The terrible <em>if</em> that held his skeleton
finger up before the face of your
hope, that drove sleep from your
eyes, that weighed upon you ceaselessly,
shall fade to a shadow, and
the shadow shall disappear in sunshine&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deo
volente!</i></p>

<p>The sea was smooth&mdash;perhaps the
prayers of the mother had smoothed
it; the sky was sunny&mdash;it may have
been for that mother's sake; and one
blessed tide that came running up
the harbor, ripple after ripple falling
on the shore like breathless messengers,
brought a ship in from the
East with a precious freight for the
owners, and for Mrs. Rowan a freight
more precious than if the ship had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
been piled for her mast-high with
gold.</p>

<p>A young man's handsome bronzed
face looked eagerly through the rigging,
and saw a carriage drawn up
close to the wharf, a man standing
beside the open door of it, and a
woman's pale face leaning out. The
pale face turned red as he looked,
and his mother's hands were stretched
toward him.</p>

<p>"O Dick! my own boy!"</p>

<p>"Jump right in and go home with
your mother," said Mr. Williams.
"I want to see the captain."</p>

<p>And this reminds us that we are
before our story. Several notable
incidents had occurred in Mrs. Rowan's
life before that happy day. One
was that, on the first of September,
just a month before, Mr. Williams
had asked her to be his wife. The
two were sitting together after tea,
Helen having gone to a concert with
her aunt. Mrs. Rowan was hemming
handkerchiefs for Mr. Williams,
and thinking of Dick, wondering
where he was and what he might be
doing just at that moment, and Mr.
Williams was glancing over the <cite>Evening
Post</cite>, and thinking of himself
and his companion.</p>

<p>If the President of the United
States, at that time General Taylor,
had sent Daniel Webster as his ambassador
to invite Mrs. Rowan to
preside over the White House for
him, she could not have been more
astonished.</p>

<p>There was nothing amazing in the
manner of the proposal, however.
Mr. Williams had just been reading
an editorial on the "Wilmot proviso,"
and, having finished it, took
his pipe from his mouth, glanced
across the table on which his elbow
leaned, and said quietly, "I've been
thinking that we may as well get
married, as we shall probably always
live together. Helen and Dick will
some time build nests of their own,
and they won't want either of us. I
shall treat you as well as I always
have, and I hope you will be satisfied
with that, and I shall do something
for Dick. I'm rather in love
with the fellow. I really cannot see
why you should object, though I
give you credit for being surprised.
If you had expected me to ask you,
I should have disappointed you.
Suppose we should be married before
Dick gets home, for a pleasant surprise
for him!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan had dropped her work,
and sat staring at Mr. Williams, to
see if he were jesting.</p>

<p>"I am in earnest," he said.
"How does the idea strike you?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me"&mdash;she stammered
faintly, and stopped there.</p>

<p>"So I perceive," was the dry comment
with which he put his pipe between
his lips again. "Take time.
Don't be in a hurry to answer; I
am not a frantic lover of twenty."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan sat with her hands
clasped on the pile of handkerchiefs
in her lap, and tried to think. It
would be good for Dick, it would be
better for Dick, it would be best for
Dick. On Dick's account, she could
not dream of refusing; indeed, she
would not have presumed to refuse,
even had there been no Dick in the
case. But, for all that, Mr. Williams's
last sentence rang in her ears,
and made her eyes fill. Once upon a
time&mdash;so long ago!&mdash;she was young
and pretty, and then there was somebody
handsomer, better educated,
more talented than this man, who was
a frantic lover of twenty when he asked
her to be his wife. If she had known
better then, been more earnest and
serious, that blossom day of her life
had borne good fruit, perhaps, instead
of an apple of Sodom, and her husband
might have been still living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
If she had loved him less weakly,
she might have saved him.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Mr. Williams, having
given her ten minutes by the
clock.</p>

<p>She started, and came back to the
present. In the pain of the past she
was momentarily strong. "I suppose
you know best for yourself," she
said quietly; "and I have no objection
for Dick's sake."</p>

<p>Mr. Williams had been a little afraid
of a scene, and her quiet and the tears
in her eyes touched him. "I don't
believe you will be sorry for it, Jane,"
he said kindly. "I have heard that
you have had one sad experience,
and I can promise you that you shall
have nothing like that from me."</p>

<p>A slight shadow, almost a frown,
passed over her face. "You are
very kind," she said in a cold voice.
"But as to the past, no one is to
blame but me. I stand by the man
I married when I was a young girl.
I loved him then and always, and I
hope to meet him again. He was
too good for me."</p>

<p>"All right!" replied the merchant
cheerfully, but with some surprise.
He had not thought that the widow
possessed so much spirit. "We need
not disagree about him. We can
enter into a partnership for the rest
of our lives. As to the other world,
I'll ask for no mortgages on that.
If you run away with Mr. Rowan
when we get there, I won't run
after you. May be somebody else
will be claiming me. I'm satisfied,
if you are. We are too old for sentiment."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned again to the
<cite>Evening Post</cite>, and pursued his reading.</p>

<p>Too old for sentiment! She looked
at him with eyes in which, for a
moment, a high and shining wonder
dilated. Why, if Richard had lived
and prospered, and she had made
him happy, she could have run to
meet him with roses of joy in her
cheeks, though she were half a century
old. She could have been as
watchful of his looks and tones, as
quick to tune her own by them, as
when she was a girl. Too old for
sentiment! Well, it takes all sorts
of people to make a world, she
thought.</p>

<p>An hour of silence passed, the woman
sewing, the man reading. At
ten o'clock Mrs. Rowan rose to go
to bed. Mr. Williams looked up.
"Let's see, this is September first,"
he said. "Suppose we call in the
parson about the tenth?"</p>

<p>She stopped&mdash;she and her breath.</p>

<p>"You know we need not bother
about a bridal tour," he said. "And
I think we may as well keep our
own counsel. When it is all over,
I'll introduce you to Mrs. Bond as a
new sister-in-law. Don't be afraid:
I will make her keep the peace. I
am a justice, you know."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mrs. Rowan.
"Do as you like."</p>

<p>There was no more said that
night; but the next morning Mr.
Williams gave the widow a short
lecture on the manner in which he
wished her to conduct herself toward
those about her. "You are too
humble and yielding," he said. "Of
course, I do not expect you to change
your character; but, recollect, you
have me to stand by you. If Sarah
Bond should annoy you, stand your
ground. If the servants are impudent,
dismiss them. If anything
whatever happens displeasing to you,
tell me the minute I get home, and
I will set the matter right."</p>

<p>With that he went.</p>

<p>An hour after, a carriage drew up
at the door, and a woman came into
the house, and asked to see Mrs.
Rowan. She was a woman of middle
age, and looked nervous and worried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am Miss Bird, Miss Clinton's
companion," she announced. "Miss
Clinton wants to see you right away.
She has sent the carriage for
you."</p>

<p>"Who is Miss Clinton?" Mrs.
Rowan asked; "and what does she
want of me?"</p>

<p>The companion looked at her in
astonishment. Not know who Miss
Clinton was! But it must be true
that she did not, or she would not have
presumed to ask the other question.
"Miss Clinton is one of the first
ladies in Boston," Miss Bird said,
with quite a grand air. "When you
go to her, she will probably tell you
what she wants."</p>

<p>"Cannot she come to see me?"
Mrs. Rowan asked.</p>

<p>This last piece of assumption was
from the future Mrs. Williams, not
from Mr. Williams's housekeeper.</p>

<p>"Why, what can you be thinking
of?" the woman cried. "Miss Clinton
must be eighty years old, if not
ninety. I am not sure but she is a
hundred."</p>

<p>Having ventured so much, after a
slight pause, Miss Bird went on.
"And she is like cider, the older she
grows, the sourer she grows."</p>

<p>"Oh! then, I will go," Mrs. Rowan
said at once. "I didn't know she
was so old."</p>

<p>She did not hurry, however. She
arrayed herself deliberately from head
to foot, and came down to find Miss
Bird pacing the entry in a fever of
impatience.</p>

<p>"Dear me! do come!" exclaimed
that frightened creature, and unceremoniously
pulled Mrs. Rowan into the
carriage. "Drive for your life!" she
called out then to the coachman.</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter with Miss
Clinton?" inquired Mrs. Rowan anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh! bless us!" sighed the companion.
"Something is always the
matter with Miss Clinton when she
has to wait."</p>

<p>They reached the house&mdash;a large,
old-fashioned one in a most respectable
locality&mdash;entered, and went up-stairs
to a sunny parlor with windows
looking into a garden. The four
walls of this room were entirely covered
with pictures, the central places
being occupied by four portraits of
a lady, the same lady, painted in
different costumes, and at different
ages. It was a handsome face, not
without signs of talent. The original
of these portraits sat in an arm-chair
near one of the windows. The
silvery curls of a wig clustered about
her wrinkled face, a scarlet India
shawl was wrapped around her tall,
upright form, and her small hands
glittered with rings. On a table at
her elbow were her hand-bell, eye-glasses,
scent-bottle, snuff-box, and
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonbonnière</i>.</p>

<p>As the two entered the room, the
old lady snatched her glasses, and
put them up with a shaking hand.
"So you have got here at last!" she
cried out. "Have you been taking
Mr. What's-his-name's housekeeper
a drive on the Mill-dam, Bird?"</p>

<p>"I was obliged to wait for Mrs.
Rowan," Bird said meekly. "She
will tell you."</p>

<p>"I came as soon as I was ready,
ma'am," interposed Mrs. Rowan. "I
did not want to take the trouble to
come at all. If you have no business
with me, I will go home again."</p>

<p>Miss Clinton turned and stared at
the speaker, noticing her for the first
time.</p>

<p>"I have business with you," she
said in a sharp voice, after having
looked the widow over deliberately.
"Come here! Bird, bring a chair,
and then go out of the room."</p>

<p>Bird obeyed.</p>

<p>"I want to know about that Yorke
girl," the old lady began, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
were alone. "If you wish to befriend
her, you had better tell me all
you know. As for Amy Arnold, she
deserves to be poor. I will not give
her a dollar. She was always a sentimental
simpleton, with her fine
ideas. Not but fine ideas are good
in their place: I always had them,
but I had common sense too. I
kept my sentiments, as I keep my
rings and brooches, for ornament;
that is the way sensible people do;
but she must pave the common way
with hers. Fancy a girl with absolute
beauty, and money in expectation,
if she behaved herself, marrying
a poor artist because, forsooth, they
had congenial souls! Congenial fiddlesticks!
If I had had the power,
I would have shut her up till she
came to her senses. I am thankful
to be able to say that I did box her
ears soundly. Fortunately, the fellow
died in a year, and Mr. Charles
Yorke took pity on her. Charles
Yorke is a respectable man, but I
am not fond of him. I was fond of
Robert till he treated Alice Mills so.
Though, indeed, it was an escape for
Alice; for he would have broken her
heart. Robert didn't know enough
to love a plain woman.</p>

<p>"The little Pole knew how to
make him behave himself. I rather
liked that girl, and I would have
done something for them if Alice
had not been my friend. What is
the child like? Tell me all about
her."</p>

<p>The door opened. "I won't see
anybody!" Miss Clinton screamed,
waving the servant away. Then, as
he was going, she called him back.
"Who is it? Alice Mills? The very
one I want! Show her in!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan looked with eager interest
at this visitor, and saw a lady
of medium size, graceful figure, and
plain face. Was she plain, though?
That was the first impression; but
when she had taken Miss Clinton's
hand, and kissed her cheek tenderly,
putting her other hand on the other
cheek, in a pretty, caressing way,
and had asked sweetly of the old
lady's health, Mrs. Rowan found her
beautiful. So still and gentle, and
yet so bright, was she, all harmony
seemed to have entered the room
with her. Even Miss Clinton's harsh
face softened as she looked up at
her with a gaze of fondness that had
something imploring in it, and clung
to her hand a moment.</p>

<p>"You have come in good time,
my dear," she said then, in a voice
far gentler than she had spoken with
before. "This is the person who
had charge of Robert Yorke's daughter."</p>

<p>The lady had seated herself close
to Miss Clinton's side, with a hand
still resting on the arm of her chair.
At this announcement she turned
rather quickly, but with instinctive
courtesy, and looked searchingly at
Mrs. Rowan. Then she went to
take her hand. "I had a letter from
Edith to-day," she said, "and she
mentioned you very affectionately.
I thought when I read it that I would
go to see you."</p>

<p>"Ahem!" coughed Miss Clinton
harshly. "Come here, Alice! I
have sent for Mrs. What's-her-name
to tell us all about the child, so you
are saved the trouble of going to
her."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan's impulse had been
to kiss the gentle hand that touched
hers, but this interruption checked
her. Miss Mills went back to her
seat, and the catechism began. It
was not a pleasant one. More than
once the widow thought that "one
of the first ladies in Boston" was a
very rude and impudent old woman;
but for the sake of that sweet face,
which seemed to entreat her forbearance,
she answered civilly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span></p>

<p>The questioning ended. "Now
you may go," said Miss Clinton, and,
turning her back on Mrs. Rowan, began
to talk to her friend.</p>

<p>"O my friend! how can you?"
exclaimed Miss Mills reproachfully.
"You are so kind, Mrs. Rowan,"
rising to take leave of her. "I am
glad to have seen you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rowan's face was crimson.
What would Dick say to see his mother
so treated? and what would Mr.
Williams say?</p>

<p>"Why, Alice, she is that John
Williams's housekeeper," the old woman
said, when Mrs. Rowan had
gone.</p>

<p>"And what are you?" was the
question which rose almost to the
younger lady's indignant lips. But
she suppressed it, and only showed
her disapproval by sitting silent a
moment.</p>

<p>"Did you expect me to get up
and make a court courtesy?" pursued
Miss Clinton. "Why, I wouldn't
do that for you, my dear. And why
should I not tell her to go? I had
no more to say to her, and I dare
say she was glad to get away. If
people fell in love with me as they
do with you, you soft creature! then
I might be sweeter with them; but
they hate me, and so I can afford to
be sincere. It saves trouble, besides."</p>

<p>"If every one practised that sort
of sincerity, we should soon lapse
into barbarism," was the quiet reply.</p>

<p>"If you only came here to lecture
and scold me, you had better have
staid away," the old woman cried,
beginning to tremble.</p>

<p>The other said nothing, only sat
and looked steadily at her. With
Alice Mills, charity was a virtue, not
a weakness. She beheld with pain
and terror this woman, whose whole
life had been one of utter selfishness,
who was going down to the grave
with no love in her heart for God
nor her neighbor. She knew that
she was the only one who dared to
speak the truth to Miss Clinton, and
therefore she dared not be silent.
She knew that she was the only one
in whom the lonely old sinner believed,
or whom she could be influenced
by; and it was one of the
prayerful studies of her life how best
to use that power. To yield to pity,
and refrain from reproof, would be
to encourage faults which had become
habitual; so, instead of coaxing
and soothing, she only waited
for submission, not to herself, but to
right and justice. The time for Miss
Clinton's conversion was so short,
and the progress had been so slow,
this friend was almost tempted to
despair. "Final impenitence" seemed
to be written in those hard old
eyes, on that bitter old mouth.</p>

<p>Miss Clinton scolded, then complained,
then bemoaned herself, finally
submitted. "You know, Alice,
I have got so in the habit of ordering
people about, and most people
are so slavish, I do not think," she
said, wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>That was all her friend asked&mdash;a
sense of having done wrong. Then
came the time for soothing, and for
bright and cheerful talk.</p>

<p>After such a regimen, it might
reasonably be supposed that Miss
Clinton would treat her next visitor
with decent civility; and the immediate
happy result of the lesson was
that for that day Bird escaped further
abuse.</p>

<p>When, a fortnight later, Miss Mills
told the old lady that Mr. Williams
and Mrs. Rowan were married, Miss
Clinton was astounded. "That accounts
for her turning so red when I
told her to go," she said. "Well,
well, I must be polite to Bird. For
anything I know, she may be engaged
to John C. Calhoun."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun was one of the old
lady's idols.</p>

<p>"Married his housekeeper!" she
pursued dreamily. "What a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potpourri</i>
society is becoming! Though
now I think of it, John Williams
came from nothing."</p>

<p>"We all came from nothing, dear,"
said the other softly, "and soon we
shall return to nothing."</p>

<p>Yes, Mrs. Rowan was married,
and quite at home in her new character.
Mrs. Bond had been met in
open field, challenged, engaged, and
routed. At present she was at home
nursing her wounds; but we may
confidently expect that in time she
will hand in her submission to the
powers that be. They were quite
willing to wait: their impatience
was not devouring. Their minds
were pleasantly occupied about this
time by several things. Dick's return
was the principal joyful event.
Besides that, Major Cleaveland was
visiting them. He had come up to
superintend the refurnishing of his
town-house for the reception of a
bride. His marriage was to take
place in a week or two at Seaton,
and his partner, with his new wife
and step-son, were invited to go
down and be present at the ceremony.
Mrs. Rowan-Williams had
hesitated very much about accepting
the invitation, but it was urged by
the bridegroom-elect; Mr. Williams
was disposed to go, Dick looked his
desire to go, Edith had written a
coaxing letter, and even Hester
Yorke had sent a very pretty note,
hoping that they would come. So
it was decided that they should go.</p>

<p>Why should Hester Yorke's invitation
be of special consequence,
does any one ask? Having been
put off as long as was possible, the
truth must be told at last, though
with great dissatisfaction. Miss Hester
Yorke is to be the bride. Instead
of fixing his affections on Melicent,
who was twenty years his junior, or
Clara, who was twenty two, nothing
would satisfy this man but Hester,
the youngest, and Hester he won.</p>

<p>But it was a good while before he
won the father and mother. Mr.
Yorke consented first, rather ungraciously,
but Mrs. Yorke did not
yield till the last minute, and then
only to her husband's solicitations.</p>

<p>"If Hester is satisfied to marry a
man old enough to be her father,"
he said, "we may as well consent.
The age is the only objection."</p>

<p>"Hester is satisfied now," the
mother said anxiously; "but she is
only a child. We do not know how
it will be ten years hence, when her
character will be more developed.
She will then be twenty-eight, and
he fifty. "Oh! I have no patience
with these ridiculous widowers!"
And the lady wrung her hands.</p>

<p>"You misjudge Hester, my dear,"
the husband said. "She has developed
all she ever will. She is no
pomegranate in the bud, but a cherry
fully ripened. Have you never observed
that whatever is hers is always
perfect in her eyes? She is
ready now to maintain to the world
that this is the most beautiful house
that ever was built; that rat-holes
are an advantage; that our furniture
is the more desirable for being worn;
that our roses are finer than any
others, our vines more graceful, our
birds more musical. Why, my dear,
she thinks that I am a beauty!"</p>

<p>A soft little laugh rippled over
Mrs. Yorke's lips. "So do I!" she
said.</p>

<p>"That is because you look at me
with such beautiful eyes," replied the
gentleman gallantly. It was not often
that his personal appearance was
complimented. "But, to return:
Hester will be the same to her husband.
Once married to him, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
will be absolutely convinced that
there is not to be found his equal. I
have no fear but that, ten years hence,
if Major Cleaveland should be placed
by the side of the most magnificent
man on earth, Hester would maintain
boldly that her husband was the
superior. No; I anticipate no trouble
for a long while. The only disagreeable
view I take is, that when
Hester is fifty, the golden middle age
for a healthy woman, she will be
nursing a childish old man of seventy-four,
instead of having an equal
friend and companion."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" exclaimed the wife,
"I cannot possibly weep over what
may happen thirty-two years
hence."</p>

<p>And so the matter was settled; and
now the Major was doing his utmost
in honor of the event. The house
in Seaton had been already put in perfect
order, and the house in town was
now, as we see, being adorned. They
were to come there immediately, after
a quiet wedding at Hester's
home.</p>

<p>When Major Cleaveland returned
to Seaton, a week after the wedding,
he carried two offerings from Mrs.
Rowan, one for the bride-elect, the
other for Edith. Hester's present
was quite simple, a package of photographic
views taken in the city of
Peking, and, seen through a stereoscope,
almost as good as a visit to
that city. But Dick's offering to
Edith was an extravagant one: it
was a Maltese cross set with emeralds.</p>

<p>This gift created a warm discussion
in the Yorke family, who were almost
unanimous against Edith's accepting
it. Carl was especially indignant.
"Edith is almost a young lady," he
said; "and the fellow is presuming
in sending her such a present. If
he does not know better, he should
be taught." Even Mrs. Yorke was
disposed to be strict. But when
they had all spoken, it was found
that Edith had a voice.</p>

<p>They were in the sitting-room with
Major Cleaveland, who had just arrived,
and Mrs. Yorke was in the
centre of the group. She had opened
the box, and held the cross up
glittering against her white hand.
Edith had not touched it. She stood
beside her aunt's chair, and listened
while the discussion went on. Her
eyes were cast down, and she seemed
perfectly quiet; but, while she listened,
into her usually pale cheeks a
color grew, deepening from pink to
a glowing crimson.</p>

<p>"I shall not refuse Dick's present,"
she said decidedly, when they came
to a pause; and as she spoke up
went her eyelids. Finding that Dick
had no other friend but her, that he
had enemies, perhaps, that his feelings
were not to be counted, instantly
she came to the rescue. As her
glance flashed swiftly around the circle,
it was as though a blade had
been swung before their eyes.</p>

<p>"But, my dearest Edith," began
Melicent, and then went over the
whole argument again in her most
suave and convincing manner.</p>

<p>"I know it all," Edith replied
firmly. "I know what people consider
proper about presents; but this
is not a common case. I would not
take that cross from Carl, nor from
any other gentleman. But Dick is
like no one else to me, and he shall
not be hurt nor offended. He took
pains to get the present, and thought
a good deal about it, and brought it
over the ocean for me, and was in
hopes that I would be pleased; and
I will not disappoint him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Yorke took the girl's hand
affectionately, the disputed jewel
dropping in her lap. "I would not
hurt his feelings for the world, my
love," she said. "Leave it all to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">[613]</a></span>
I will explain to him so that he
cannot be offended."</p>

<p>"Aunt Amy, no one in the world
can explain between Dick Rowan
and me," said Edith, withdrawing
her hand. "You have been good
to me, all of you, and I love you, and
will obey you when it is right. But
this isn't right: it is only what people
who know nothing about it think
proper. Dick was good to me first
of all. Mamma used to have him
take care of me when I was a tiny
little girl; and, after mamma died, he
did everything for me. If I wanted
anything, he got it for me if he
could; and if I broke his playthings
and tore his books, he never scolded
me. I remember once I hit him
with a stick, and almost put his eye
out; and when I cried, he kissed me
and said, 'I know you didn't mean
to, dear,' before his eye had stopped
aching. That was the way he always
did. And afterward, when the
children laughed at me, because I
was poor and queer, and they threw
mud and stones at me here in the
streets of Seaton, Dick fought them,
he alone against the whole. And I
never cried but he comforted me.
I could not tell all that he did for
me, though I should talk a week.
I won't turn him off now. If he
wanted to die for me, I'd let him; for
it would be more than cruel to refuse.
So, Aunt Amy, please to give me the
cross. I am going to wear it always."</p>

<p>They were all silent at this first
outbreak of her who had often won
from Carl the greeting of Coriolanus
to his wife, "My gracious silence,
hail!" No one had the heart to refuse
any longer, whatever might be
the consequences of yielding.</p>

<p>Edith took the chain, and hung it
about her neck, looking down on the
cross a moment as it rested on her
bosom. "Green means hope," she
said.</p>

<p>Carl left the room. No one else
said anything. Her address had struck
too near home. They might forget
the time when she had been poor and
homeless, but she was not obliged
to; and they could not in conscience
quite disentangle her from her
past.</p>

<p>"Dearest Aunt Amy, do smile
again!" Edith entreated, putting her
arms around Mrs. Yorke's neck.
"You are not displeased with me!
Don't you remember you told Dick
that ingratitude is the vice of slaves?"</p>

<p>"Dear child, you do as you will
with me," her aunt sighed; and so
the dispute ended.</p>

<p>One day of the next week, as the
steamer came ploughing up the Narrows
into Seaton Bay, Mrs. Williams
and her son sat in a corner of the
deck by themselves. Mr. Williams,
slightly sea-sick, was below. There
were not many passengers that day,
and no one seemed to have recognized
these two. They sat leaning
on the rail and looking off over the
water. It could scarcely be expected
that they would not feel some
emotion on such a return to their
native town after such a departure,
and Dick held his mother's trembling
hand tight in his, which, indeed, was
scarcely steady.</p>

<p>A low, sandy island lay before them,
and seemed to toss on the surface of
the bay. "I wish I could go over
there before we go home again," the
mother whispered, looking up wistfully
into her son's face.</p>

<p>"No!" he answered. "We shall be
commented on and watched sufficiently
as it is. Let the dead past
bury its dead. It is a shame and
disgrace. I cannot have it dragged
up again."</p>

<p>He spoke firmly, and his mother
was silenced. She feared her son in
his rare moods of sternness. They
awed her far more than his earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">[614]</a></span>
passions had. Those she had understood,
and could soothe; but now he
was growing out of her knowledge.
Besides, she did not dream what an
ordeal his meeting with Edith's family
was to be to him. To her simplicity,
Hester's invitation and Edith's
allowed intercourse with them seemed
an entire adoption; but he knew
better. On the whole, it was a time
above all when he least desired to be
remembered of his father.</p>

<p>As they neared the wharf, they
saw Major Cleaveland standing
there, with a tall, slim girl beside
him. She wore a black riding-cap
and feather, and a glimpse of scarlet
petticoat showed as she gathered
up her riding-skirt. The disengaged
hand was flung out with a quick
welcoming gesture as she saw
them, and a flush went over her
face.</p>

<p>Mr. Rowan drew back to let Mr.
and Mrs. Williams land first, and
waited till his mother had received
the first greeting. Then he took
Edith's hand, and looked down at her
as she looked up at him. Her eyes
sparkled, and she breathed quickly
with joy. There was not, he saw, a
cloud over the delight with which
she met him.</p>

<p>"Dick," she said ecstatically, after
a minute, "I think that you are perfectly
splendid!"</p>

<p>In the old times they had used each
other's eyes for mirrors: why not
now?</p>

<p>"You do!" said the young man,
tossing his head with a slight laugh.</p>

<p>"Thank you!"</p>

<p>"But you have grown," she pursued,
contemplating him with great
admiration. "And have not I
grown tall?"</p>

<p>She stood back blushingly to be inspected.</p>

<p>"You're a pretty fair height,"
Dick said with an air of moderation.</p>

<p>"Come, they're waiting for us. Is
this your pony?"</p>

<p>He lifted her to the saddle, then
stepped into the carriage, and she
rode alongside. He looked at her,
and every nerve in him vibrated with
triumph. She wore his cross on her
bosom! They had not thought how
much he had dared to mean by that.
"If they let her take the cross, they
will let her take me," he had said.
If the gift had been refused, he would
never have seen Edith again.</p>

<p>"It is most beautiful," she said,
catching his glance. "I got Father
Rasle to bless it, and I wear it all
the time."</p>

<p>Presently Edith began to take notice
of Mrs. Williams; and as she
looked, her wonder grew. Mrs.
Rowan had possessed only a wisp
of faded hair: Mrs. Williams had a
profuse and shining <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevelure</i>. Mrs.
Rowan's teeth had been few and far
between: Mrs. Williams's smile disclosed
two unbroken and immaculate
rows of ivory. But for the lingering
lines in the forehead, and the
kind eyes, and the simple ways, Edith
would scarcely have recognized her
old friend.</p>

<p>It was time for an early dinner
when they reached the house, and
Edith was to stay all day, and be
hostess. It had been agreed that,
under the circumstances, no hospitable
cares could be expected from
their host. His visitors were to use
his house as a hotel, and do quite as
they pleased in it. But in the afternoon,
Major Cleaveland insisted that
Mr. Rowan should go with him and
call upon Hester, who wished to
thank him without delay for the
pretty present he had sent her. Dick
would much have preferred remaining
where he was; but he went, and
was received with the utmost cordiality
by all but Carl, who was not
visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>But Carl came up in the evening
to escort Edith home, and had then
"the honor of making Mr. Rowan's
acquaintance" in a remarkably cool
and ceremonious fashion.</p>

<p>"Mother thought you had better
come home early, Edith, because we
must all be up early in the morning,"
he said, after a little very polite
and very constrained talk. "Besides,"
he added, with a slight smile,
"I believe Patrick does not allow his
horse to be out after nine o'clock.
He lent him to me very grudgingly."</p>

<p>The night was one of perfect silence
as the two rode homeward
under the stars, and they were not
talkative. Scarcely a word was
spoken till they had crossed the
bridge, and were riding up North
Street. Then Edith spoke in a low
voice:</p>

<p>"Are you tired, Carl?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. Are you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Then there was silence for a while,
till Edith began again:</p>

<p>"Carl, do not you think that Mrs.
Williams is pleasant?"</p>

<p>"I did not observe," he replied
coolly. "I scarcely heard her speak.
I do not doubt that she is pleasant
to you."</p>

<p>"Oh! you talked with Mr. Williams,"
she said. "Did you like
him?"</p>

<p>"Not particularly."</p>

<p>Another silence. They had turned
from the public road, and were
being enclosed in the forest.</p>

<p>"How did you like Dick Rowan,
Carl?" The question came with a
faint sense of strain in the voice, and
it was not answered immediately.</p>

<p>"I hope you will not expect me
to be as fond of him as you are," he
said presently. "He may be like a
brother to you, but to me he is a
stranger."</p>

<p>"But what do you think of him?"
she persisted.</p>

<p>"He is very handsome," Carl said
in a quiet tone, "and he looks like
an honest fellow. I have no fault to
find with him."</p>

<p>They turned up the avenue, alighted,
and went up the steps together.</p>

<p>"Carl," said Edith wistfully, "are
you troubled about anything?"</p>

<p>"What should trouble me, child?"
he asked, with a touch of kindness
in his voice.</p>

<p>"I do not know," she sighed.
"Then are you vexed with me about
anything?"</p>

<p>"No, Edith," he said, "I have
no reason to be vexed with any one
but myself. Good-night, dear!"</p>

<p>She echoed the good-night, and
went up-stairs, not nearly so happy
as she had expected to be that night.</p>

<p>The next morning the marriage
took place. For Hester's sake we
will say that the bride was lovely,
and the wedding a pretty one. But
we will not further celebrate Major
Cleaveland's anachronistic nuptials.</p>

<p>The Williamses were to leave town
in the evening. They dined at the
Yorkes', and went away immediately
after dinner. Edith was to walk
down to the hotel with him, and stay
there till the stage-coach should come
for him.</p>

<p>"And we will walk the very longest
way, Dick," she said. "I have
hardly had a chance to speak to you
yet. We have plenty of time, for
they have to go up after their valises."</p>

<p>While Edith ran up-stairs for her
hat, Mr. Rowan took leave of the
others, and Mrs. Yorke walked out
into the portico with him. The lady
seemed to find difficulty in uttering
something which she wished to say.
But when she heard her niece coming,
she spoke hastily. "Mr. Rowan,
Edith is but a child!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span></p>

<p>His face blushed up. "I do not
forget that, Mrs. Yorke," he said;
"but also, I do not forget that she is
a child I have many a time carried
in my arms."</p>

<p>"A very headstrong young man!"
thought Mrs. Yorke, as she watched
the two go down the steps together.</p>

<p>They went up the road, to strike
into East Street, instead of down;
and as the road, after passing the
house, ceased almost entirely, they
soon found themselves in a narrow
forest track. Over their heads hung
the splendid crimson and gold canopy
of maples and beeches mingled,
and vines ran through every glowing
tone from garnet-black up to rose-color,
or hung in deep purple masses.
The mountain-ash bent to offer its
clusters of red berries, and there was
no tiniest shrub nor leaf but had its
gala autumn dress. A blue mist
showed faintly through the long forest
reaches, and rich earth-odors rose
on the moist air.</p>

<p>The immense conversation which
was to have been held seemed to
be forgotten; scarcely a word was
said till they came out into the eastern
road. Then Edith pointed across
the way, and said, "Is it not lovely?"
and they stopped a moment to
look.</p>

<p>There was a tract of low swampy
land there silvered over with mist,
that seemed scarcely to rise a foot
above it. Through this mist showed
a fine emerald-green thick with pink
and purple blooms, and over it swam
a yellow-bird, in smooth undulations,
as if it floated on a tide.</p>

<p>The two stood there for some time
in silence, till that picture was perfectly
painted on the memory of each.
Then they walked on into the village.
In a few minutes after they
reached the hotel, the coach came
down from Major Cleaveland's with
Mr. and Mrs. Williams in it, the fare-wells
were said, and they were
gone.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.<br />

A DESPAIRING CHAPTER.</h3>

<p>After all, no person's story can
be truly told without beginning at
the creation of the world. Not that
we would invoke Darwinian aid, or
inquire into the family peculiarities
of the sponge&mdash;"O philoprogenitive
sponge!" Nor would we intimate
that the soul is as passive to circumstances
as a rudderless ship to wind
and wave, but assert rather that it is
like the steamer, the great struggling
creature, with a will at heart. But
circumstances are strong, even very
old circumstances, and our ancestors
have a word to say, not as to our
final destination, but as to the road
by which we shall reach it. Coarser
natures get their bent after the manner
commemorated by the Mohammedan
legend: some Eblis of an ancestor
spurned their clay with his
foot when the angels had kneaded
it, and the dent is long in filling out;
but finer souls are strung like the
wind-harp, and from the long line-gale
of ghosts preceding them is
stretched now and then a viewless
finger, which sets vibrating some silent
inherited chord. Is it a vanishing
and perpetually recurring strain
of a Gregorian chant, breaking awfully
into the pauses of a godless
life? Is it an airily riotous Bacchic
wreathing the slow minims of a choral?
Catch up the strain and repeat
it as you will, all your life shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
be a palimpsest with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum laudamus</i>
written largely over the fading
errors; still the merit of good-will
is not all your own. Or trip as your
dutiful measure may, tangled in that
wild song; the fault is not all yours.
Many a Cassius may claim indulgence
on the score of some rash inherited
humor.</p>

<p>Does the reader perceive that we
are trying to excuse somebody?</p>

<p>The truth is, Carl has disappointed
us. We meant him to be an exquisite
and heroic creation, perfect
in every way; and we had a right to
expect that our intentions would be
realized; did not we make him ourself?
But just as the clay model
was finished, and we were complacently
admiring it, into our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">atelier</i>
stepped the grand antique mother,
Nature. She came with a sound of
scornful sweet laughter, which seemed
to roll cloud-wise under her feet,
and curl up around the strong and
supple form, and wreathe the wide
slope of her shoulders. "Look you,"
she said, and pointed her finger, a
little shaken with merriment, "that
is not the way <em>I</em> make men. There
are no muscles in those limbs, there
is no sight under that brow, there is
no live heart beating in that narrow
chest. You have left no chance for
a soul to get into your manikin." So
saying, she stretched her finger yet
further, and mockingly pushed it
through the skull of our model; then
disappeared, leaving all the air behind
her tremulous with mirth.</p>

<p>Let us hurry over the present of
this Carl with a hole in his head, out
of which all his ideal perfections are
escaping, but into which his true soul
may some day enter. Outwardly he
is studying law, inwardly he is studying
chaos. What books Mr. Griffeth
gave him to read, we know not;
but we do know that the sentences
were like smooth, strong fingers untying
from him many of the restraints
of his former education. With Theodore
Parker, he could call the sacred
Scriptures the "Hebrew mythology,"
and describe baptism as "being ecclesiastically
sprinkled with water;"
and having got so far&mdash;"What," said
he, "is the use of Mr. Theodore Parker?"
and so dropped him. The
conversations Mr. Griffeth held with
him we know little of, but may presume
that they were not profitable.
We only know that they were frequent.
The two were constantly together,
more constantly than suited
Mr. Yorke, who lost faith in the minister.
"He has no pity," he said.
"He seems to have studied theology
only to see how many sins he can
commit without losing his soul." But
this disapprobation of his step-father's
had no effect on the young man,
who was perfectly infatuated with his
new friend. This quiet life of Carl's
had produced a mental stagnation,
from which arose all sorts of miasmata.
He dimly knew them as such,
but that did not prevent his breathing
and poisoning himself with them.
Perhaps he also suspected that Mr.
Griffeth's wings would melt off if he
were exposed to a strong and searching
light; but the companionship
was fascinating, and Carl fancied that
he had found his like. It was not
so; they were alike only as sharp
six and flat seven are; they had
identical moods; but Carl stooped
to where his new friend rose.</p>

<p>One of the fine things the young
man learned was the use of opium.
"It makes you feel like a god
while it lasts," says Mr. Griffeth,
"puts you into a perfectly Olympian
state. But I warn you," he added,
with a tardy touch of conscience, "it
does not last long, and from Olympia
you sink to Hades."</p>

<p>"And then," says Carl, "you go
about as Dante did, with your hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
folded under your mantle, and people
stand aside, and whisper about you.
I will take the dark with the bright."</p>

<p>So saying, he measured out the
drops, and drank them with the invocation:
"Come, winged enchantment,
and bear me wherever thou wilt."</p>

<p>Reader, didst thou ever see one
dear to thee made tipsy with liquor?
and dost thou remember the mingled
pain, and pity, and contempt with
which thou didst look on his abasement?
A man, a king of the earth,
a brother of saints, a friend of the
Crucified, a child of the Most High,
grovelling thus!</p>

<p>One comfort, nature, and not we,
made this man fall so. O better
comfort! he is earning mountain-loads
of self-contempt, which shall
one day be paid with interest.</p>

<p>Only a few other items have we to
record at this time. The young ladies
had made their proposed literary
venture&mdash;Melicent with signal failure,
Clara with partial success. Publishers
had twenty-five different reasons,
each better than the last, why a
volume of European travels would
not be at that particular time a fortunate
venture, and were unanimously
unable to say at what future period
the prospect would be brighter.
Miss Yorke was not entirely blind.
She perceived that her book was a
failure, and withdrew it. Whether
she contemplated any other work,
her family did not know. She maintained
a profound silence on the subject.
They suspected, however, that
she was studying out a novel. Clara's
first story, read with great applause
to the family at home, was modestly
offered to a respectable second-class
magazine, and accepted, with a request
for more. So Miss Clara occupies
the proud position of being
independent in the matter of pocket-money,
and an occasional benefactor
to the others.</p>

<p>Of more consequence to us is the
fact that Father Rasle is now settled
in Seaton, and building a church
there. Something else is also being
built in Seaton&mdash;a "Native American"
society, alias Know-nothing.
This society excited much attention
and enthusiasm, especially in Mr.
Griffeth's congregation, and among
their friends. All the young men
joined it. It seemed precisely to
suit the genius of Seaton.</p>

<p>Against this party Mr. Charles
Yorke fought with all his strength.
It was contrary to the spirit of the
constitution, he persisted; it had nothing
in common with the Declaration
of Independence. The views
and aims of the party were narrow
and bigoted, and their leaders were
ignorant demagogues.</p>

<p>But all that he gained by his denunciations
was unpopularity, and
the party prospered yet more. It had
not only the young and the infidel
for active members; it had a sly
encouragement from Mr. Griffeth, a
cool approval from Doctor Martin,
and an earnest help from the Rev.
Mr. Conway, the gentleman whom
we left in a soiled state half-way
from Bragon to Seaton. He had
preached the next Sunday with acceptance
to his congregation, and
was now settled among them. We
may remark that he has not yet forgiven
Mr. Griffeth the mistake about
the pulpit, nor will he be convinced
that it was a mistake. In consequence
of this obduracy, the two
ministers live in a state of feud, in
which their congregations take part,
to the slight disedification of old-fashioned
people.</p>

<h2>THE SERIAL LITERATURE OF ENGLAND.</h2>


<p>Considering the number of periodicals
at present published in Great
Britain, the extent of their aggregate
circulation, and the range and variety
of topics discussed in their pages,
their effect on the public mind of
that country for good or evil can
scarcely be overestimated. A magazine
holds a middle place between
the legitimate literature of books and
the ephemeral and generally ill-digested
effusions of newspapers, and
appeals, especially to the middle
classes, as it were, in science, taste,
and art. Business men who have
not time to read long histories or
elaborately compiled scientific works,
and indolent ones who have not industry
enough to do so, seek information
or pleasure in perusing their
periodicals, while the traveller as he
is hurried along over the ocean or
the railroad, and the overwrought
student as he closes his ponderous
folio or lays aside his pen, alike
find recreation and relief in the lighter
and more mirthful contributions
which, judiciously dispersed, usually
grace the pages of our monthly and
semi-monthly press. Books, too, of
late have accumulated to such a
fearful extent that the bibliographer
finds it impossible to read even a
moiety of them to ascertain their value,
and so is forced to form his opinion
of them second-hand by accepting
the <i>dicta</i> of the industrious reviewer,
whose decision, when judiciously and
intelligently given, thus becomes of
the utmost benefit to authors and
readers.</p>

<p>Of late years the number and variety
of English magazines have
greatly increased, and we presume
the patronage bestowed on them has
kept pace with their growth. We
would be glad to be in a position to
say that, in liberality of spirit, fairness
and originality, the improvement
is equally apparent; but such is not
the case, and in this respect forms a
marked contrast to the progress which
distinguishes a similar class of publications
in this and some European
countries. Propriety of expression
and artistic construction of sentences,
which have always characterized
the composition of English writers,
even of second or third order of ability,
remain, but much of the force,
mental grasp, and wide range of view,
as well as profound and exact knowledge,
which once distinguished their
criticisms and essays, are wanting.
We are aware that the generation of
able men whose genius once illuminated
the columns of <cite>Blackwood</cite>, <cite>Fraser</cite>,
<cite>Household Words</cite>, etc., has passed
away; but why have they left us
no literary heirs, no worthy successors,
to fill their places and wield their
trenchant pens? Has the English
mind deteriorated, or is it that English
public taste has become so corrupted
by the unwholesome sweets
of the Trollopes, the Braddons, and
like sensationalists, that it rejects the
salutary food presented it by more
serious and natural writers? We
can hardly believe that this latter is
the efficient cause; for before the era
of Griffin, Dickens, Thackeray, Lever,
and many other favorite authors, several
of whose admirable novels and
essays first reached the public through
the magazines, the taste of the masses
was even more vitiated by the romances
of the last century, hundreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
of which were sure to be found on
the shelves of every circulating library
in the country. Neither can we
properly attribute this "dearth of
fame" to a want of adequate pecuniary
reward; for we are assured that
encouragement in this respect is sufficiently
ample, and, compared with
that of a generation ago, might be
called munificent. We are, therefore,
forced to the conclusion that there
is an actual present deficiency of mentality
among the majority of English
writers&mdash;another indication, perhaps,
of that decay of the Anglo-Saxon
race, so-called, in England which has
been so long and so pertinaciously
asserted by her rivals. It is certainly
true that the spirit of money-getting
is more and more engrossing the
attention of the people; and, while
other and younger nations, like Russia,
Germany, and the United States,
are rapidly growing into immense
proportions, both artistic and literary
as well as politically, England, wrapped
up mentally in her own self-conceit,
as she is geographically shackled
by the four seas, is sinking into
comparative provincialism.</p>

<p>The tone and temper of her writers
when treating foreign subjects,
we submit, amply prove this, were
all other evidence wanting. Their
views of the affairs of other nations
lack fairness, amplitude, and, not unfrequently,
truthfulness, and always
seem like those of men who look
upon the broad outer world through
the wrong end of a spy-glass. Can
anything be more unjust than the
following passage, which we find <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en
passant</i> in an article on France in
the May number of <cite>Blackwood</cite>?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There is, however, one cause of hopelessness
as regards France, and for the
life of me I do not see how it is to be encountered.
Here are the people who not
only asserted that they were the politest
and most civilized, but the bravest and
boldest in Europe, now exhibiting themselves
not only as utterly degraded and
debased, but actually as destitute of courage
as of morals."</p></blockquote>

<p>Apart from the want of generosity
exhibited by the writer above in thus
ungraciously stigmatizing an unfortunate
ally, his estimate of her condition
is exceedingly unfair, and, as he
professes in the article to have been
a frequent visitor to her shores in bygone
days, we must attribute his obliquity
to something else than ignorance.
In her recent struggle, France
showed nothing like cowardice; but,
on the contrary, her children, veterans
and recruits, exhibited a courage
and heroism worthy of her proudest
days of military glory. Her signal
and rapid overthrow was due to other
causes than the want of bravery
of her soldiers. Within the space of
about two hundred days, her badly
organized, poorly equipped, and
generally indifferently commanded
troops fought seventeen pitched battles
and one hundred and sixty-five
general engagements against three-quarters
of a million of the best disciplined
troops in Europe. Of the
merits of the quarrel we have nothing
to say, but we feel assured that
the troops of Kaiser William would
feel little complimented at being told
that their splendid victories were
gained over a demoralized and cowardly
nation. As to France being
destitute of morals, the contrary is
the fact. It is true that Paris, like
London and other large centres of
population, contains much that is
immoral and unholy; but Paris is no
longer France, and those best acquainted
with the whole country allege
that religion was never more securely
enthroned in the hearts of the
people, nor her ministers so much
respected, as at the present moment.</p>

<p>American questions are treated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
our transatlantic contemporaries in
a manner somewhat different. Occasionally
they speak of us in impartial
and even complimentary terms,
but generally in a vein of lofty patronage,
such as an indulgent and
much-enduring father might be supposed
to use to his erring but not altogether
godless offspring. If we
exhibit a leaning toward Russia, we
are forthwith admonished to beware
of encouraging despotism; if we recall
our ancient friendship with France,
we are likely to be reminded that with
England we are the same in language,
blood, and religion; but, if there
is a treaty favorable to the "mother-country"
to be concocted, or a European
coalition adverse to the interests
of our mother aforesaid apprehended,
Shakespeare, Milton, and Newton
are resurrected and become our joint
inheritance, and Great Britain and
the United States are instantly declared
to be two, and the only two, "free
governments in the universe" having
a common interest and a common destiny.
Occasionally this maternal surveillance
is varied by an allusion to our
social or topographical peculiarities,
really ludicrous from its very absurdity,
while it shows, with all this assumption
of superiority, how very inaccurate
is the knowledge of our kind relations.
In a late article on the destruction
of the ancient forests, a writer
in the <cite>Fortnightly Review</cite> gravely
protests against "the further destruction
of scenery unique in Great
Britain, and, if represented in America
at all, but imperfectly represented
by the oak openings of Michigan."
Now, if an American were
to talk of the extensive prairies
of Caermarthenshire or the picturesque
mountains of Kent, his ignorance
of the physical peculiarities of
even those small subdivisions would
be apt to evoke the severe censure
of our London critics.</p>

<p>Again, in their reviews of American
works, the English magazines,
whether through design or from want
of knowing better, usually fall into
serious error in respect to the constituent
elements of our population.
They affect to regard the American
mind simply as a mere emanation of
that of England, weakened, it is true,
by time and distance, but still worthy
of some consideration. How such
a patent fallacy can be tolerated in
that country, our nearest European
neighbor as we are her best customer,
is incomprehensible. We have,
it is true, generally adopted what was
good in her civil polity at the time
of the Revolution, and the majority
of us speak her language as our native
tongue; but we are no more
English than we are German, Irish,
French, or Spanish in our origin, temperament,
habits of thought, or development
of genius. We are all
these combined, as well as something
more which only the free spirit of a
republic can call into being, and, if
modesty would permit us, we could
say with truthfulness that there is contained
within that word "American"
all the best elements of every European
race. The latest instance of this
self-deception we recently noticed in
<cite>Saint Paul's Magazine</cite>, in what was
otherwise a very excellent notice of
Hawthorne's works.</p>

<p>But America has the advantage of
the practical arguments of material
prosperity and rapidly developing
æsthetic tastes on her side, and is
fast becoming indifferent to adverse
criticism. With less fortunate countries,
like Ireland, for instance, the
case is altogether different. The
English magazine writers, when at a
loss for an illustration or "an awful
example," never hesitate to draw on
the history or pretended history of
the sister kingdom for the required
materials. We have before us some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">[622]</a></span>
dozen periodicals published in London
and Edinburgh, the majority of
the articles in which are either on Irish
topics or contain allusions to the affairs
of that unfortunate and misgoverned
people, and that, too, as it may
be supposed, in no very partial or
eulogistic terms. This unrelenting
hostility to a weak nation, while it
may do very well for placemen and
land-agents who live by the griefs and
afflictions of others, is unworthy the
chivalrous spirit which should distinguish
the true knight of the quill.
We fear, however, that Burke's saying
with regard to the chivalry of the
middle ages is equally applicable to
our own times, and that the free lances
of the English metropolis, who
will fight in any and every cause, are
more in demand than the earnest
searchers after truth and the honest
correctors of public morals.</p>

<p>We argue this from two facts: It
is not unusual for the same person to
be employed in writing for two or
more publications altogether opposed
in aim and character; and, secondly,
from the total absence of anything
like religious sentiment in nearly the
entire periodical press, if we except
those published in the direct interests
of Protestantism, and in those it degenerates
into absolute bigotry. We
do not say that all the magazines
are positively immoral, but they certainly
are negatively so, and in this
respect probably more dangerous to
the well-being of society. Take their
method of treating some late publications
which have been much spoken
of, for example. We find that
Darwin's elaborately nonsensical theory
of the origin of the human race is
handled with as much delicacy and
seriousness as if the reviewers had
grave doubts in their own minds as
to whether their ancestors had or
had not been monkeys, or at least
as if they considered it an open question
not yet definitely settled; while
the blasphemies of Renan, instead of
eliciting condemnation and reproof,
are carefully and quietly reproduced
and laid before the reader with a
gentle caution against their novelty.
Still, the prevailing tone of the English
magazines can scarcely be said
to be actively anti-Catholic or unchristian.
It partakes more of paganism
in a modified form, which,
while not openly violating the laws
of society, practically ignores the interference
of Providence in the affairs
of men, like the Universalist preacher
whose highest eulogy, as pronounced
by a friend, was that he was perfectly
neutral in politics and religion.
The short prose fiction sketches in
which the English periodicals abound
and which in artistic merit far excel
ours, are based on the same inamiable
sentimentalism&mdash;a sort of polite indifferentism,
by which the heroes and
heroines are made to walk through
life unconscious that there is a Being
to whom the fall of a sparrow is not
unknown, and who directs the destiny
of nations as well as individuals.
Fiction, if not the best, is certainly a
very effective medium of communicating
correct ideas and pure morality
to the young, and, while it should
be read sparingly, cannot in this
age be altogether dispensed with;
and therefore it is that too much
care cannot be taken to see that it is
not only free from grossness, but that
it is actively and primarily permeated
by the spirit of religion. Where
this is not observed, as we regret to
find in the case of the English magazines,
mere style of composition,
felicity of diction, and power of description
count for nothing. They
are simply evidences of the perversion
of the gifts of God, which ought
always and in all places to be used
for the greater glory and honor of
the Giver.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR OF FATHER JOHN DE BRÉBEUF, S.J.</h2>


<p>Well acquainted as was Father
Brébeuf, from long study and intelligent
observation, with the character
and customs of the Hurons, he knew
thoroughly how to propitiate their
favor and regain their respect. His
manly and courageous bearing during
the prevalence of the fever, and
his undaunted coolness and fearlessness
of death in the midst of the late
persecution, had won for him the
admiration of all the nobler spirits in
the tribe. In December, 1637, he
gave a grand banquet, to which were
invited the chiefs and warriors of the
country. He there addressed his
assembled guests on the necessity of
embracing the true faith. In January
of the next year, the head chief
of the Hurons, or Aondecho, as he
was called, returned the compliment
by giving a similar banquet, to which
Father Brébeuf was invited; when
he came to the banquet, the chief
presented him to the assembly, not
as a guest, but as the host of the
occasion, addressing them thus:</p>

<p>"Not I, but Echon, assembled you;
the object of the deliberation I know
not; but be it what it may, it must, I
am convinced, be of great moment
Let all then hearken attentively."
The ever-ready and zealous missionary
then addressed the assembly
on the same subject&mdash;the true
faith. He followed this up with another
banquet in February, where
his address was followed by the
evident but silent conviction of his
hearers. At its close, the Aondecho
arose, and exhorted his warriors
and subjects to yield themselves to
the counsels of the fathers. The
deep guttural expression of approval,
ho! ho! ho! resounded on all sides,
and the grateful missionaries made
their joyful thanksgiving by chanting
the hymn of the Holy Ghost. Then,
with one acclaim, the chiefs and
warriors adopted Father Brébeuf
into their tribe, and created him one
of the chiefs of the land&mdash;a dignity
which invested him with the power
of summoning assemblies of the people
in his own cabin.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1638, the fever
began to disappear from the country.
Now, too, the first Christian marriage
was solemnized. The wife of
Joseph Chiwattenwha had been baptized
in March, and the two were
united together in holy matrimony by
Father Brébeuf on St. Joseph's Day.
Peter Tsiwendaentaha united with
them in approaching the holy communion.</p>

<p>The public duties of the mission
occupied the entire time of Father
Brébeuf. The abandonment of
Ihonitiria, in consequence of the
recent scourge, caused Fathers le
Mercier, Ragueneau, Garnier, Jogues,
Pijart, and Chatelain to remove that
mission to Teananstayaé, the residence
of Louis de Sainte Foi. But
they felt great fears about that place,
since its chief had shortly before instigated
the warriors to canvass the
murder of the missionaries at Ossossané.
But Father Brébeuf, with
characteristic courage and zeal, went
to the village, and as a chief of the
nation summoned a council of the
chiefs and warriors. The mission
was formally announced on the spot,
and we shall soon see the fathers
offering up the Holy Mass at Teananstayaé.
The year before, an Iroquois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">[624]</a></span>
prisoner had received baptism
there from the hands of Father Brébeuf;
and now nearly a hundred
prisoners, condemned to death, were
instructed and baptized by the missionaries
on the eve of their execution.
About this time an entire
tribe, the Wenrohronons, abandoned
by their allies, the Neutrals, came
and threw themselves upon the hospitality
of the Hurons. They were
wasting away from the effects of the
recent plague, and the fathers at
Ossossané rushed to their relief.
They nursed their sick, instructed
and baptized their dying, many of
whom expired with the waters of
baptism fresh upon their brows. The
Hurons themselves were moved in
favor of a religion capable of producing
such heroic examples; and on
the 11th of November, St. Martin's
Day, one entire family, and the
heads of two others, were baptized in
health. On the Feast of the Immaculate
Conception, others were converted
and baptized, numbering in
all thirty; so that at Christmas there
was assembled, around that rude but
holy altar in the wilderness, a sincere
and fervent little congregation of
Christians, adoring and offering their
gifts to the infant Saviour.</p>

<p>The missionaries were now distributed
in sets of four, consisting of
three of the earlier and one of the
recently arrived fathers, at the various
points through the country
where missions were located. Many
new missions were opened, and the
flying visits to villages whose missions
had been broken up by the
persecution were renewed. Among
the new missions now opened was the
one already alluded to at Teananstayaé,
or St. Joseph's, whose commencement
on New Year's Day was cheered
with fifty baptisms. The indefatigable
Brébeuf was its founder, and
with him were associated Father
Jogues, whose Indian name was
Ondesson, and Father Ragueneau.
The most perfect system, both as regards
the internal regulation of the
affairs of the mission-house and its
inmates, and the external labors of
the fathers, was introduced by Father
Brébeuf, which enabled them to
perform an almost incredible amount
of missionary labor. Among the
natives, an aged chief named Ondehorrea,
who was now a Christian,
was of great assistance to them in
their labors. He had once repulsed
the fathers from his bed of illness,
and, having called in the sorcerers,
he then rejected them, and recalled
the fathers, who were at once at his
side. He was soon sufficiently instructed
to be baptized, and at the
moment that the saving waters touched
his forehead, he arose suddenly in
perfect health, to the amazement of
all. He ever afterwards showed his
sincerity as a Christian, and his gratitude
to the fathers, by remaining
their constant friend and faithful
assistant.</p>

<p>A curious affair now arose, which
will convey to us some idea of the
trials with which those devoted missionaries
had to contend. A woman
living in a little village near Ossossané,
as she was passing along one
night, saw the moon fall upon her
head, and immediately change into
a beautiful female, holding a child in
her arms. The apparition declared
herself to be the sovereign of that
country and all the nations dwelling
therein, and required that her sovereign
power should be acknowledged
by each nation's making a present
or offering. The apparition designated
the offering which each nation
should bring, not omitting the French,
who were required to present blue
blankets. The woman was taken ill,
and demanded that the order of the
divinity should be complied with for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">[625]</a></span>
her recovery. A council was accordingly
held at Ossossané, to which
the missionaries were invited. They
attended, and were bold enough to
oppose so wicked a homage to a
false deity. But all was in vain, for
the whole country was in a ferment
of excitement. The most abominable
orgies known to savage life were
celebrated in honor of this new goddess,
and men were hurrying in all
directions to procure the required
presents. Soon all the offerings were
collected together, except the blue
blankets of the French, and the missionaries
were called upon to do
homage in the manner required of
them. They resolutely refused compliance
with such a requisition, and,
as may be well imagined, they immediately
became the objects of
general indignation. Amid threats
and imprecations, and the glare of
the uplifted tomahawk, those courageous
priests refused to let a blanket
go from their cabin, except upon
condition of the immediate cessation
of all that was going on, and the dismissal
of the woman. These terms
were rejected, the orgies were continued,
and peril surrounded the
fathers at every step; still they
could not be induced to yield the
points. Fortunately for the missionaries,
however, the apparition paid
the woman another visit, and released
the French from the unholy tribute.</p>

<p>In September, 1639, new missionaries
arrived. Unfortunately, an Indian
in one of the canoes of their
flotilla was infected with the small-pox,
and that disease was thus introduced
into the country. The malady
began to spread with fearful
rapidity, and, as usual, the origin of
this evil, as of all others, was attributed
to the missionaries. Persecution
was at once renewed, the cross
was violently dragged down from
their houses, their cabins were invaded,
their crucifixes torn from
their persons, one of them was cruelly
beaten, and all were threatened
with death. So great was their peril
at one time that they calmly prepared
themselves for martyrdom.
They were finally ordered peremptorily
from the town. In the midst
of these persecutions, the heart of
Father Brébeuf was consoled with a
vision: the Blessed Virgin, as the
Mother of Sorrows, came to console
her son and to confirm his courage;
she appeared to him with her heart
transfixed with swords. At once his
resolution was taken; he remained
at his post of danger and of care,
and continued his missionary labors.</p>

<p>In consequence of these repeated
persecutions, and the constant exposure
of the fathers to the renewal of
them by the malice of the medicine-men,
it was determined to erect a
missionary residence apart from the
villages and their vicious population,
which might prove a safe retreat for
the fathers in time of trouble, and a
convenient place for instructing the
catechumens and others well disposed
to receive the faith. During the
years that Father Brébeuf was at
Ossossané, displaying the most heroic
zeal and disinterested charity, he
had met with the blackest ingratitude
from the persons whom he had fed
by depriving himself of nourishment,
and on one occasion he was ignominiously
beaten in public. The other
fathers had suffered similar indignities
and maltreatment. While glorying,
like the saints, in these sufferings
for the sake of God and his church,
he yet saw the necessity, for the sake
of the mission, of a separate residence.
It was this necessity that
originated St. Mary's on the river
Wye.</p>

<p>In the various missions whose establishments
we have mentioned, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
had been baptized up to the summer
of 1640 about one thousand persons:
of these two hundred and sixty were
infants, and though some of them
were restored to health, by means
apparently miraculous, most of them
went in baptismal purity to swell the
ranks of the church triumphant in
heaven. It was about this time that
Father Brébeuf ceased to be superior
of the mission, and was succeeded
by Father Jerome Lalemant. The
Jesuit, ever true to his institute, passed
from command to obedience with
the gladness and alacrity known only
to the humble soldiers of the cross.
His career as superior, arduous and
glorious, was also abundant in fruit
to the church. He was indeed the
father of the Huron mission. Our
eloquent Bancroft, in speaking of his
and his companions' labors to introduce
Christianity among the aborigines
of our continent, says that St.
Joseph's chapel, wherein, "in the
gaze of thronging crowds, vespers
and matins began to be chanted, and
the sacred bread was consecrated by
solemn Mass, amazed the hereditary
guardians of the council-fires of the
Huron tribes. Beautiful testimony
of the equality of the human race!
the sacred wafer, emblem of the divinity
in man, all that the church offered
to the princes and nobles of the
European world, was shared with
the humblest of the savage neophytes.
The hunter, as he returned from his
wild roamings, was taught to hope
for eternal rest; the braves, as they
came from war, were warned of the
wrath that kindles against sinners a
never-dying fire, fiercer far than the
fires of the Mohawks; and the idlers
of the Indian villages were told the
exciting tale of the Saviour's death
for their redemption."</p>

<p>Father Brébeuf, already the founder
of so many missions, now starts
out with unabated ardor to open
others. Accompanied by Father
Chaumonot, he advanced into the
country of the Neutrals, naming the
first town he entered "All Saints."
He pushed onward to the Niagara,
to the residence of Tsoharissen, the
chief whom all the Neuter towns
obeyed. Hither the calumnies of
some hostile Hurons had preceded
him, and represented Echon as the
most terrible of sorcerers. The two
missionaries were repulsed on all
sides, and in their retreat from place
to place were pursued by the arrows
of their enemies. Still they persevered,
and they succeeded in visiting
eighteen towns, preached the Gospel
in ten of them, and announced for
the first time the words of truth to
at least three thousand souls. During
these labors, the keen eye of
Brébeuf saw the importance to New
France of an occupation of the Niagara
by missions and trading posts;
the travels of the missionaries would
be greatly shortened, the warlike Iroquois
restrained, the Hurons saved
from a war of extermination, and the
whole interior continent opened to
European civilization and the faith
of Christ. The plan of Father Brébeuf
received little attention at court:
a neglect which decided the fate of
empires. We cannot determine precisely
how far Father Brébeuf advanced
into the country; only one
town received the missionaries, which
they called St. Michael's. They,
however, approached as far into the
Iroquois country as was possible; still
Bancroft says it is uncertain that he
ever stood upon the territory of our
republic.</p>

<p>But the hostile Hurons, not contented
with the furious persecution
they had raised against the fathers in
their own country, pursued them into
their new mission. Two Huron deputies
soon arrived, and proclaimed
a tempting reward for such as would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
deliver the country from those devoted
men. While the council was
engaged in debating the question of
his expulsion or death, Father Brébeuf
was making his examen of conscience
in the cabin where he lodged,
and suddenly he beheld a fearful
spectre: the figure held three darts,
which were successively hurled against
him and his companion, but were
averted by an unseen hand. Presaging
evil from the vision, the two
fathers made their confessions to each
other, and, thus prepared to die, they
went to rest. They afterward learned
from their post, who returned to
the cabin late at night, that the session
of the council was long and
stormy; three times the young braves
had insisted on butchering them on
the spot, but were restrained by the
sachems. But now, such was the
state of the feeling aroused against
them, that they could not advance a
step in safety. Turned from every
shelter, and encountering death at
every step, they wandered as outcasts
over the country. Believing that
their longer continuance was only
calculated to increase the savage hatred
of the people against them, and
retard the introduction of the faith,
the fathers retreated to the Neuter
town which they had named All
Saints. Here they wintered and spent
the time in instructing the people.
In the spring, they advanced as far
as Teotongniatou, or St. Williams,
where a charitable woman gave them
a shelter. While thus lingering, Father
Brébeuf arranged his Huron
dictionary to the Neuter dialect, in
which he had made considerable progress
in four months. No sooner
had the ameliorating influences of
spring rendered travelling just possible,
even to such travellers as those
who had been accustomed for years
to brave every hardship, than Father
Brébeuf and his companions started
on one of the most extraordinary
journeys on record. Already spent
with fatigues and privations, and pursued
by danger, Father Brébeuf had
to remain six days in the woods,
sleeping on the snow, and without a
covering or shed over his head. The
cold was so intense that the trees
themselves did split with a noise like
the crack of a rifle. A special Providence
protected him, for he exhibited
no evidence that he had been
cold or exposed. Loaded with the provisions
which he was compelled to carry,
as there were no relays on the way,
he travelled two days across a lake
of ice; and while thus struggling
onward, his heart and eyes lifted up
to heaven, he fell upon the ice. His
portly frame gave such violence to
his fall that he was unable to rise
from the ice. After a long time he
was lifted up by one of his companions,
and then found that his extremities
were palsied, and he could
not lift his feet from the ground. Besides,
his collar-bone was broken.
He bore the last in silence, as it was
not apparent. This fact was only
discovered two years later by the
surgeon who attended him at Quebec.
In vain his companions begged
the privilege of drawing him the
remaining thirty-six miles of the
journey in a sled, and at other times
to assist him on the way; he declined
all their generous offers, and labored
onward, scarcely able to drag
one foot after the other. It was thus
he crossed the level country, and
when he came to the mountains, he
crept up on his hands and feet, and
allowed himself to slide down on the
opposite side, retarding his too rapid
descent with his bruised and aching
hands. Thus he completed his journey,
which for love of suffering, patience,
and humility compares with
some of the most heroic achievements
recorded of the saints. His companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">[628]</a></span>
went forward on other labors,
but Father Brébeuf, while waiting
for the next flotilla bound for
Quebec, determined to take what he
styled his "repose"&mdash;a repose busily
spent in making important arrangements
for the missions, which his superior
knowledge of everything relating
to them enabled him alone to
effect.</p>

<p>On the passage to Three Rivers,
Father Brébeuf was accompanied by
Sondatsaa, an exemplary catechumen,
and a party chiefly Christians
or catechumens. They arrived at
Three Rivers after a narrow escape
from the murderous blades of the
Mohawks, who were lying in wait
for them. Finding it impossible for
Fathers Ragueneau and Menard to
reach their missions in Huronia without
a strong guard, Father Brébeuf
proceeded with Father Ragueneau
and Sondatsaa to Sillery, in order to
obtain succor for them. Here, moved
by the entreaties of all, and especially
of Sondatsaa himself, and having completed
his instruction, Father Brébeuf
consented to baptize that zealous convert.
The ceremony was performed
at Sillery, on the 27th of June, with
great pomp, and in the presence of a
concourse of Indians. The Chevalier
de Montmagny was godfather to the
convert, who received the Christian
name of Charles. He now returned,
a Christian, to his own country, bearing
in his little flotilla the two fathers
destined for the Huron mission. While
Father Brébeuf was dwelling at Sillery,
the next flotilla of Hurons that
came bore its usual freight of calumnies
against Echon. They now accused
him of being colleagued with
the Iroquois for the destruction of the
Hurons. This renewal of calumny
checked, for a time, his success; but
he continued his preparations and
arrangements for the Neuter mission
and his endeavors to convert his persecutors
to the faith. He endeavored
to persuade some of these Hurons to
remain and winter with him, in order
to receive instructions. Two of them,
who were left behind in the chase,
were induced to remain, and Father
Brébeuf, after the usual instruction
and probation, had the consolation
of receiving these into the one fold
of the One Shepherd. He also succeeded
in gaining a number of other
Huron converts. Father Nimont,
struck with the happy results of his labors,
resolved to detain him another
winter at Sillery. It was during this
summer that Father Jogues came to
Sillery for supplies. Here these future
martyrs met in the prosecution of their
noble labors; but soon the unconquerable
Brébeuf saw his saintly companion
set forth on his perilous mission
over the country infested by the Iroquois,
to carry relief to the Huron
missionaries. Himself was soon to
follow.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1643, Father Brébeuf
proceeded to Three Rivers,
where he was cheered by tidings
of Father Jogues. That holy missionary,
in returning from Sillery to
bring succor to his companions in
Huronia, had fallen a captive into
the hands of the fierce Iroquois, and
his fate was the object of intense
anxiety. Father Brébeuf now learned
that he was still living. The bold
and generous Brébeuf arranged
with a Huron, who was going out, to
wait for letters to Father Jogues at
Fort Richelieu; the father, bearing
the letters, penetrated as far as the
fort, but the courage of the Huron
messenger failed; he had passed and
was afraid to return, and the Jesuit
was compelled to retrace his steps
without succeeding in conveying a
word of comfort and encouragement
to his captive brother. In the spring
of 1644, Father Bressani also, in endeavoring
to reach Huronia, fell into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">[629]</a></span>
the hands of the Iroquois. But the
Huron missionaries must be succored
at every hazard, and Father Brébeuf
was now chosen for this perilous enterprise.
Setting out in the summer,
with an escort of twenty soldiers given
to him by the governor, he reached
the Huron missions in safety on the
7<sup>th</sup> of September. The Huron mission
had ever been the dearest object
of Father Brébeuf's heart. Restored
now to his chosen vineyard, he devoted
himself to the task of converting
those tribes with a zeal and an
energy worthy of his former glorious
career. Year after year he continued
his heroic labors; and, though our
pen cannot follow him, step by step,
through the trials, sacrifices, and exertions
which his seraphic love inspired
him to encounter, they were
recorded in minutest detail by angelic
pens in heaven. Success crowned
the efforts of Father Brébeuf and his
companions. Persecution ceased, and
the whole country was becoming conquered
to the faith. In August, 1646,
Father Gabriel Lalemant, full of zeal
and courage, was joined with Father
Brébeuf in the mission of St. Ignatius,
which embraced the town of St. Louis
and some smaller villages. By this
time, the horrid superstitions of the
country had given way to the pure
and holy rites of Catholic worship,
and the cross, so lately despised,
feared, and hated, had now become
the object of love and veneration.
Father Bressani writes: "The faith
had now made the conquest of the
entire country." "We might say
they were now ripe for heaven; that
naught was needed but the reaping-hook
of death to lay the harvest up
in the safe garner-house of paradise."
"Religion seemed at last the peaceful
mistress of the land."</p>

<p>Allusion has several times been
made to the visions from on high
which were mercifully sent to warn
Father Brébeuf of danger impending,
or to sustain him under the extraordinary
afflictions, persecutions,
and sufferings which at times seemed
to exceed even his remarkable powers
of endurance. Some of these have
already been described. To the Protestant
and non-Catholic mind, these
miraculous communications to the
saints are but the imaginings of morbid
and diseased intellects. Parkman,
in his <cite>Jesuits in North America</cite>,
relates the following visions of Father
Brébeuf only to classify them as psychological
phenomena: "It is," he
says, "scarcely necessary to add that
signs and voices from another world,
visitations from hell and visions
from heaven, were incidents of no
rare occurrence in the lives of these
ardent apostles. To Brébeuf, whose
deep nature, like a furnace white-hot,
glowed with the still intensity of his
enthusiasm, they were especially frequent.
Demons, in troops, appeared
before him, sometimes in the guise of
men, sometimes as bears, wolves, or
wild-cats. He called on God, and
the apparitions vanished. Death, like
a skeleton, sometimes menaced him;
and once, as he faced it with an unquailing
eye, it fell powerless at his
feet. A demon, in the form of a
woman, assailed him with the temptation
which beset St. Benedict among
the rocks of Subiaco; but Brébeuf
signed the cross, and the infernal siren
melted into air. He saw the vision
of a vast and gorgeous palace, and a
miraculous voice assured him that
such was to be the reward of those
who dwelt in savage hovels for the
cause of God. Angels appeared to
him, and more than once St. Joseph
and the Virgin were visibly present
before his sight. Once, when he was
among the Neutral nation, in the winter
of 1640, he beheld the ominous
apparition of a great cross slowly approaching
from the quarter where lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">[630]</a></span>
the country of the Iroquois. He told
the vision to his companions.</p>

<p>"'What was it like? how large was
it?' they eagerly demanded.</p>

<p>"'Large enough,' replied the priest,
'to crucify us all.'</p>

<p>"To explain such phenomena is
the province of psychology and not
of history. Their occurrence is no
matter of surprise, and it would be
superfluous to doubt that they were
recounted in good faith and with a
full belief in their reality. In these
enthusiasts we find striking examples
of one of the morbid forces of human
nature; yet, in candor, let us do honor
to what was genuine in them&mdash;that
principle of self-abnegation which is
the life of true religion, and which is
vital no less to the highest forms of
heroism."</p>

<p>Bancroft, alluding to the same subject,
and to the life, austerities, and
self-sacrifice of Father Brébeuf, says:
"The missionaries themselves possessed
the weaknesses and the virtues
of their order. For fifteen years enduring
the infinite labors and perils
of the Huron mission, and exhibiting,
as it was said, 'an absolute pattern
of every religious virtue,' Jean de
Brébeuf, respecting even the nod of
his distant superiors, bowed his mind
and his judgment to obedience. Besides
the assiduous fatigues of his office,
each day, and sometimes twice
in the day, he applied to himself the
lash; beneath a bristling hair-shirt he
wore an iron girdle, armed on all sides
with projecting points; his fasts were
frequent; almost always his pious
vigils continued deep into the night.
In vain did Asmodeus assume for
him the forms of earthly beauty; his
eye rested benignantly on visions of
divine things. Once, imparadised in
a trance, he beheld the Mother of him
whose cross he bore, surrounded by
a crowd of virgins, in the beatitudes
of heaven. Once, as he himself has
recorded, while engaged in penance,
he saw Christ unfold his arms to embrace
him with the utmost love, promising
oblivion of his sins. Once,
late at night, while praying in the silence,
he had a vision of an infinite
number of crosses, and, with mighty
heart, he strove, again and again, to
grasp them all. Often he saw the
shapes of foul fiends, now appearing
as madmen, now as raging beasts;
and often he beheld the image of
death, a bloodless form, by the side
of the stake, struggling with bonds,
and at last falling, as a harmless
spectre, at his feet. Having vowed
to seek out suffering for the greater
glory of God, he renewed that vow
every day, at the moment of tasting
the sacred wafer; and as his cupidity
for martyrdom grew into a passion,
he exclaimed, 'What shall I render
to thee, Jesus my Lord, for all thy
benefits? I will accept thy cup,
and invoke thy name: and in sight
of the Eternal Father and the Holy
Spirit, of the most holy Mother of
Christ and St. Joseph, before angels,
apostles, and martyrs, before St. Ignatius
and Francis Xavier, he made
a vow never to decline an opportunity
of martyrdom, and never to receive
the death-blow but with joy."</p>

<p>In the eye of Catholic faith, these
visions and special revelations are
but the fruits and blessings of a revealed
and supernatural religion.
While they do not fall to the lot of
us ordinary Christians, nor are they
necessary helps in the little we accomplish
for God and his church,
it is difficult to conceive how the
saints and martyrs could have performed
their sublime actions, or met
their cruel and unjust deaths for
God's sake with a smile&mdash;sacrifices so
far above and even repugnant to our
nature&mdash;without the aid of these supernatural
supports. The dedication
of himself to martyrdom, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">[631]</a></span>
heroic courage and joy with which he
met his appalling fate, could only be
achieved in the bosom of a church
believing in miracles, and presenting
to her children the crown of martyrdom
as the highest reward attainable
by man. The visions of Father
Brébeuf, like other miracles, depend
wholly upon the evidence and circumstances
by which they are supported
to entitle them to belief. It was
not his habit to disclose them; it was
only when commanded by his superiors
that he committed them to
writing. They thus rest upon his
solemn written words, and upon their
perfect agreement in many instances
with contemporaneous facts transpiring
beyond his sight and knowledge.
To suppose him to have been deluded
would be to contradict every
quality of mind and character so
universally attributed to him by all
Protestant historians.</p>

<p>Father Brébeuf's aspirations for
the crown of martyrdom were prophetic
of his appointed and glorious
end. But to him all historians have
attributed the most practical views
in relation to the Indian missions,
and the coolest and wisest manner
of dealing with them. There was no
mere sentimentality in his nature.
He addressed his powerful energies
and resources to the actual conversion
of the Indians to Christianity, and we
have seen how great were the results
he achieved. But now, alas! a dark
cloud was seen gathering over the
happy Christian republic of the Hurons.
Already, during the winter of
1649, the fierce Iroquois hordes, numbering
upwards of one thousand, had
secretly passed over a space of six
hundred miles of Huron forests, and
on the sixteenth of March they appeared
suddenly before the town of St.
Ignatius, while the chiefs and warriors
were absent on the chase, and
the old men, women, and children
were buried in sleep. Strongly as the
place was fortified, this overwhelming
force carried it by storm, and
murdered its unsuspecting inhabitants.
Three only escaped, half-naked,
from the slaughter, and gave the
alarm to the village of St. Louis,
where the fathers were then laboring.
Here preparations were at once
made to offer a gallant but unequal
resistance. The women and children
were sent over forty miles of ice and
snow to seek a shelter in the cabins
of the Petuns. The chiefs exhorted
the fathers also to fly, since they could
not go to the war. But Father Brébeuf,
with all the heroism of his great
soul, answered that there was something
more necessary than fire and
steel in such a crisis; it was to have
recourse to God and the sacraments,
which none could administer but
they&mdash;that he and his companion,
the gentle Lalemant, would abandon
them only in death. The two fathers,
says Father Bressani, "now
hurried from place to place, exhorting
all to prayer, administering the
sacraments of penance and baptism
to the sick and the catechumens, in
a word, confirming all in our holy
faith. The enemy in fact remained
at the first fork only long enough to
provide for the safe keeping of the
prisoners and the safety of those left
as a garrison to guard them. After
this they marched, or rather rushed,
directly upon St. Louis. Here none
were now left but the old and sick, the
missionaries, and about a hundred
braves to defend the place. They
held out for some time, and even repulsed
the enemy at the first assault,
with the loss of about thirty killed,
but the number of the assailants being
incomparably greater, they overcame
all resistance, and, cutting
down with their axes the palisades
which defended the besieged, were
soon in possession of the town. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">[632]</a></span>
putting all to fire and steel, they consumed
in their very town, in their very
cabins, all the old, sick, and infirm
who had been unable to save themselves
by flight."</p>

<p>What contrasts the events of history
present! While this relentless
slaughter was at its height, and the
worst passions of the fiercest of heathens
were let loose, the scene of
blood, fire, and death was relieved
by the presence of Christian heroes
the most gentle, merciful, and self-sacrificing.
They stood in the breach
to the last stroke of the enemy, encouraging
the dying Christians to
fortitude and hope, the wounded to
patience, and the prisoners to courage
and perseverance in the faith. The
palisades of St. Louis finally were
cut away. The infuriate Iroquois
swept in, and the whole surviving
garrison, warriors and priests, were
all made prisoners together. The
savages rejoiced especially at the
capture of such a prisoner as Father
Brébeuf, whom they immediately
showed signs of torturing, when a
generous Oneida chief, more magnanimous
than the rest, purchased him
from his captors for a large price in
wampum. It seemed as though he
was about to be deprived of his coveted
crown; but no! the victors retracted
their bargain, and Father Brébeuf
was again seized by his enemies.
He and Father Lalemant were stripped,
bound fast, and cruelly beaten,
and their nails were torn out. But
lest some change in the tide of war
should deprive them of their prisoners,
the latter were all sent, closely
bound and tightly secured, to St. Ignatius.
Here, as they entered the
town, they were beaten and bruised
by the rabble with sticks and clubs.
The large and conspicuous frame of
Father Brébeuf attracted a double
share of blows on his already bruised
and lacerated head and body. In the
midst of these cruelties, he was forgetful
of himself, and anxious only that his
Christian Hurons, who were now his
fellow-prisoners, should be encouraged
and consoled in their extreme
danger. From the stake to which
he had been tied, beholding them
assembled for the torture, he lost
sight completely of his own greater
calamities and sufferings, and thus
he addressed them: "My children,
let us lift up our eyes to heaven in
the worst of our torments; let us
remember that God beholdeth all
we suffer, and will soon be our reward
exceeding great. Let us die
in this faith, and hope from his goodness
the accomplishment of his promises.
I pity you more than myself,
but support manfully the little torment
that yet remains. It will end
with our lives; the glory which follows
will have no end." How great
must have been his consolation when
he heard their heroic answer, a convincing
proof that Indians may be
truly converted to Christianity, and
possess the constancy to die in the
faith. "'Tis well, Echon," they cried,
"our souls will be in heaven,
while our bodies suffer on earth; entreat
God to show us mercy; we shall
invoke him to our latest breath."
Enraged at his exhortations and unflinching
zeal, even in death, some
Hurons adopted by the Iroquois
rushed upon him and burned his
flesh with a fire which they kindled
near him, they cut off his hands,
and while Father Lalemant's flesh
was cut and punctured with awls
and other sharp instruments, and hot
irons placed under his armpits, they
led him forth to torture and death
before the eyes of Father Brébeuf,
in order to add to the agonies of the
latter. As Father Brébeuf continued
to speak and to exhort his Christians,
and to threaten the vengeance of
heaven upon their persecutors, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">[633]</a></span>
cut off his lower lip and nose, and
thrust a red-hot iron down his throat.
Even after this, when he saw his superior,
the gentle Lalemant, led out
to death, he called out to him with
a broken voice in the words of St.
Paul, "We are made a spectacle to
the world, to angels, and to men."
Throwing himself at Father Brébeuf's
feet, Father Lalemant was ruthlessly
torn away, and in a few moments he
was enveloped in flames at the stake,
and his gentle soul preceded that of
the intrepid Brébeuf to heaven. Turning
next upon Father Brébeuf, they
threw a collar of red-hot axes around
his neck, which seethed and burned
their way into his flesh; he stood,
in the midst of such agonies, erect
and motionless, apparently insensible
to pain, intent only on vindicating
the faith he had so long and faithfully
announced. His tormentors were
awed by his constancy, which seemed
to them a proof that he was more
than man. But they again taxed
their ingenuity for new tortures. An
apostate Huron, who had been a
convert of Father Brébeuf in the
Huron mission, and had since been
adopted by the Iroquois, was the
first to signalize the zeal of the renegade.
He proposed to pour hot
water on the head of Father Brébeuf,
in return for the quantities of cold
water he had poured on the heads
of others in baptism. The suggestion
was received with fiendish joy,
and soon the kettle was swung.
While the water was boiling, they
added fresh cruelties to their victim's
sufferings. They crushed his mouth
and jaw with huge stones, thrust heated
iron and stones into his wounds,
and with his own eyes he beheld
them devour the slices of flesh which
they cut from his legs and arms.
Let us not cut short the appalling
story; for surely, what a martyr bore
a Christian may have <ins title="Note: probable missing text in original">courage to
Three.'and bringing</ins> the scalding
water from the caldron, they poured
it over his bruised head and lacerated
body amidst shouts and imprecations,
and, as they did so, the high-priests
of the occasion mockingly
said to him: "We baptize you that
you may be happy in heaven; for
nobody can be saved without a good
baptism." By this time Father Brébeuf's
mouth and tongue could no
longer articulate, but even yet by
his erect posture, the struggling and
brave expression of his almost expiring
eye, and even by his half-formed
words, he encouraged the Christian
captives to perseverance, and endeavored
to deter the savages from torturing
them by threats of heaven's
vengeance. Again cutting slices
from his body and devouring them
before his eyes, they told him that
his flesh was good. Some of the
renegade Hurons, more fiendish than
even the Iroquois, again mocked him
by saying: "You told us that the
more one suffers on earth, the happier
he is in heaven. We wish to
make you happy; we torment you,
because we love you; and you ought
to thank us for it." They next scalped
him, and even after this they
poured the boiling water over his
head, repeating the torture three
times; they cut off his feet, and
splitting open his stalworth and generous
chest, they crowded around
and drank with exultation the warm
blood of the expiring hero. His
eye, firm and expressive to the last,
was now dimmed in death, and at
last a chief tore out his noble and
brave heart, cut it into a thousand
pieces, and distributed it to the savage
cannibals that crowded around
to receive a share of so exalted and
unconquerable a victim. Thus perished
of earth, while crowned of
heaven, the illustrious Brébeuf, "the
founder of the Huron mission&mdash;its
truest hero, its greatest martyr."</p>

<p>The Iroquois, now glutted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">[634]</a></span>
carnage, and apprehensive of the
approach of a superior force, retired
to their own country. The fathers
from St. Mary's came to St. Ignatius
to bestow the last honors upon the
earthly remains of their martyred
companions. It was with difficulty
they discovered their burned and
mangled bodies among the mass of
slain the victorious Iroquois had left.
Their precious remains were solemnly
and sorrowfully carried to St.
Mary's, and affectionately and religiously
interred. A portion of Father
Brébeuf's relics were subsequently
carried to Quebec. A silver
bust, containing the head of the
martyr, was presented by his family
to the Canadian mission, and is still
reverently preserved by the convent
of hospital nuns in that city. So
great was his reputation for sanctity
that it became a familiar and pious
practice in Canada to invoke his intercession.
There are well-attested
cases recorded of the wonderful intervention
of heaven in favor of
those who invoked his aid as a saint
in heaven.</p>

<p>Among the many virtues which
adorned the life and character of
Father Brébeuf may be particularly
mentioned his ardent love of holy
poverty and suffering, his purity of
soul, his singleness of purpose, his
profound obedience and humility,
his zeal and courage, his love of
prayer and penitential austerities, and
his generous longing for the salvation
of souls. "The character of Brébeuf,"
says Bancroft, "was firm beyond
every trial: his virtue had been
nursed in the familiar sight of death.
Disciplined by twenty years' service
in the wilderness work, he wept bitterly
for the sufferings of his converts,
but for himself he exulted in
the prospect of martyrdom." "Thus,"
writes Mr. J. G. Shea in his <cite>History
of the Catholic Missions</cite>, "about four
o'clock in the afternoon, after three
hours of frightful torture, expired
John de Brébeuf, the real founder
of the [Huron] mission, a man such
as the Catholic Church alone can
produce; as a missionary, unequalled
for his zeal, ability, untiring exertion,
and steady perseverance; as a
servant of God, one whose virtues
the Rota would pronounce heroic;
patient in toil, hardship, suffering,
and privation; a man of prayer, of
deep and tender piety, of inflamed
love of God, in whom and for whom
he did and suffered all; as a martyr,
one of the most glorious in our annals
for the variety and atrocity of
his torments." "He came of a noble
race," says Parkman, "the same, it
is said, from which sprang the English
Earls of Arundel; but never had
the mailed barons of his line confronted
a fate so appalling with so
prodigious a constancy. To the last
he refused to flinch, and his death
was the astonishment of his murderers."</p>

<p>Praise has become exhausted on
such a subject. Would that we might
hope for some national good from
the sublime lesson he has taught us!
The red men are our brothers. The
most precious blood of a God-man
was poured out for them as for us;
and God's martyrs have joyfully
given their noble lives for their salvation.
Might not a Christian nation,
in its power and goodness, yea,
in its justice, save at least the poor
remnant of them from further slaughter;
and say to the ever-ready and
zealous missionaries of the Catholic
Church: "Go, christianize and save
our brothers; we will not slay them
more; there is land enough for us
and for them; we confide them to
your heroic charity. We will protect
you and them in the peace and good-will
of the Gospel. Go, save our
brothers"?</p>

<h2>THE ANCIENT LAWS OF IRELAND.</h2>


<p>Next to written and well-authenticated
historical annals, the clearest
insight that can be afforded us of the
civilization, polity, and social condition
of the nations of antiquity is derived
from the study of ancient laws
and customs, when their authenticity
is guaranteed by existing contemporary
authorities, and they bear in themselves
the intrinsic evidence of adaptability
to time, place, and circumstance,
so easily recognized by the antiquarian
and the philologist. Were it
possible to conceive the total destruction
of this republic with all its material
monuments and historical literature,
nothing being left for posterity
but our books of law, the philosophical
student a thousand years
hence would be able to form a pretty
correct and comprehensive idea
of the state of society at present existing
and of the nature of the institutions
under which we have the
good fortune to live. From the
large number of statutes regulating
the intercourse of man and man, he
would deduce the fact that we were
a commercial and ingenious people;
from our laws relating to real estate,
he would necessarily argue that its
ownership was general and its transmission
from one to another a matter
of everyday occurrence; and
from the few restrictions imposed on
its possession or sale, that the facilities
for its acquisition were comparatively
easy and unrestricted; while from
the care that has been taken by our
national and local legislatures to
guard the life, liberty, and prosperity
of the citizen, he would naturally conclude
that our right to the enjoyment
of these inalienable rights formed the
corner-stone of the edifice of our government.</p>

<p>In the same manner, we of this
century, looking back to a country
so old as Ireland, one of the most
antique of the family of European
nations, by examining the laws framed
in the early days of her dawning
civilization, can picture to ourselves,
even without the aid of history, the
genius of her inhabitants, and form
comparatively accurate opinions of
how much or how little intelligence
and natural sense of justice and the
"eternal fitness of things" were exhibited
by them in their efforts to regulate
and organize society. Strange
to say, we are partly indebted for
this opportunity to the English government,
never very generous in its
patronage of Irish interests, though
of course the principal credit is due
to that noble band of Irish scholars,
formerly headed by the late lamented
O'Curry, Petrie, and O'Donovan,
who by their antiquarian lore, profound
knowledge of their vernacular,
and untiring industry, have reconstructed
from the scattered and almost
illegible manuscripts deposited
in various libraries the body of the
laws of ancient Ireland, and have
presented them to the world in the
language in which they were originally
written, with the elaborate
glosses of after-years, accompanied
by an accurate English translation.
This long-desired work bears the appropriate
and principal title of <cite>Senchus
Mor</cite>, or great law, and contains
all the laws that were enforced in
Ireland from the fifth to the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">[636]</a></span>
centuries, if we except a small
portion of the island which was
occupied by the Anglo-Norman colony
from the invasion till the reign
of James I. That it was admirably
adapted to the wants and dispositions
of the people, we can judge
by the affection and tenacity with
which the natives so long clung to
it, in despite of all the efforts of the
invaders to induce them by force or
fraud to adopt that of the conquerors,
and that it was more liberal and
equitable than the harsh restrictions
of the feudal system is proved from
the alacrity of the Anglo-Norman
lords who resided without the
"pale" in conforming to it in preference
to their own enactments.</p>

<p>Like most of her other blessings,
Ireland owed the possession of this
excellent and merciful code to the
Catholic Church, for it was in the
eighth or ninth year of the ministration
of her great apostle and at his
instance that it was framed as we at
present find it, purified from all the
grossness of paganism, and freed
from the uncertainty and doubt
which always attach to mere tradition.
Up to his time, law in Ireland
had been administered at the discretion
of Brehons or judges, and,
being preserved only in the poems
of the bards and <i>ollamhs</i> (professors),
was deficient in those essential qualities
of all human legislation, exactness
and uniformity. That there
were learned and wise lawgivers in
Ireland before the introduction of
Christianity, we know from history
and from the introduction to and
the text of the <cite>Senchus</cite> itself, in
which frequent mention is made of
decisions and writings, but they were
necessarily the exponents of that
limited sense of justice which the
human mind, unaided by religion,
is capable of comprehending. The
propagation of the faith in Europe
created a complete and permanent
revolution in the laws of each country
successively visited with the light
of the gospel, and while the darkness
of paganism vanished before it, the
municipal laws which upheld idolatry
were either totally abrogated or
modified so as to conform, as much
as possible, to the benign spirit of the
church. The immediate occasion of
the revision of the Irish laws is stated
to have been the deliberate murder
of one of St. Patrick's servants
by a relative of the reigning sovereign,
but the real cause, no doubt,
was the desire of the saint to root out
of the judicature of the people all
traces of paganism as effectually as
he had erased it from their hearts.</p>

<p>Accordingly, by virtue of his high
office, he summoned a convention
of the learned men of the country, a
few years after his arrival, and proceeded
to execute his important reforms.
His principal assistants, we
are informed, were Laeghaire, monarch
of all Ireland, Corc, and Dairi,
two subordinate kings, whom we
may suppose represented the temporal
authority of the nation, and without
whose countenance and support
it would have been difficult, if not
impossible, to enforce the new code;
Rossa, Dubhtach, and Fergus, those
poets and professors whose duty it
had been to preserve and perpetuate
the legal traditions of their race and
the decisions of the Brehons; and
two ecclesiastics, Saints Benen and
Cairnech. The former of these bishops,
afterward known by the name
of Benignus, was one of St. Patrick's
earliest and favorite converts, and
eventually his successor in the primatial
see of Armagh, and the latter,
a Briton from Wales, was remarkable
alike for his piety and extensive
learning. Thus sustained by the
civil arm, and assisted by the advice
and knowledge of men well versed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">[637]</a></span>
in the common and canon law,
the saint, in addition to his other
apostolic labors, succeeded in leaving
to the people he loved so well a
harmonious and Christian code, the
spirit of which, like that of all his
teachings, sank deep in the popular
heart, and defied the efforts of time
and the ruthlessness of man to eradicate
it.</p>

<p>While this code remained the rule
of guidance for the mass of the people,
it was sacredly preserved by the
Brehons, who, though not empowered
to alter it in any respect, added elaborate
commentaries explanatory of
its general or obscure provisions; but
when the country was divided into
counties by the conquerors, and their
system took the place of the national
one, the manuscripts of the ancient
laws were scattered through
the country, in England and on the
Continent, whither they were brought
by the exiles.</p>

<p>As early as 1783, Edmund Burke,
ever mindful of the fame of his
native country, suggested the propriety
of collecting and publishing
in English or Latin those remarkable
remnants of former greatness
and wisdom, but it was not till
the year 1852 that the English government,
at the repeated solicitation
of several distinguished and influential
Irish gentlemen, consented to
lend its aid to the great work, which
from its very magnitude was beyond
the ability of any individual or voluntary
association to accomplish.
In that year, at the special instance
of Doctors Todd and Greaves, both
eminent Protestant clergymen, a
commission was issued appointing
them and several other well-known
scholars "to direct, superintend, and
carry into effect the transcription and
translation of the ancient laws of
Ireland, and the preparation of the
same for publication," etc., with power
to employ proper persons to execute
the work. The persons selected
by the commissioners were Dr.
O'Donovan and Professor O'Curry,
both thoroughly qualified to perform
so momentous and laborious a labor,
and whose conscientious discharge
of the duties so assigned them ended
only at their much lamented deaths.
With the patience and zeal of true
antiquarians, they set about transcribing
the various MSS. relating to
the old laws, deciphering the half-obliterated
characters of the earlier
centuries, and rendering the peculiar
phraseology of the Gaelic into modern
English. They were succeeded
by W. N. Hancock, LL.D., professor
of jurisprudence in Queen's College,
Belfast, and the Rev. Thaddeus O'Mahony,
professor of Irish in the Dublin
University, under whose auspices the
two volumes already in print were prepared
for publication, having first received
the sanction and approval of
the commission. With such endorsement,
we do not wonder that, speaking
of the authenticity of the <cite>Senchus
Mor</cite>, O'Curry should have said in
one of his admirable lectures on Irish
history, "I believe it will show that
the recorded account of this great
revision of the body of the laws of
Erin is as fully entitled to confidence
as any other well-authenticated fact
in ancient history."</p>

<p>The principal materials used by
the distinguished translators are thus
described in the preface to the first
volume:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I. A comparatively full copy among
the manuscripts of Trinity College, Dublin.
H. 3, 17.</p>

<p>"II. An extensive fragment of the first
part, 432, of the Harleian manuscripts in
the British Museum.</p>

<p>"III. A large fragment of the latter
part among the manuscripts of Trinity
College, Dublin, H. 2, 15.</p>

<p>"IV. A fragment among the manuscripts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">[638]</a></span>
of Trinity College, Dublin, H. 3,
18."</p></blockquote>

<p>Of the capacity of the gentlemen
above-mentioned to faithfully transcribe
and translate these valuable relics
of past legislation there can be
no doubt, nor of the genuineness and
authenticity of the records themselves.
They are not, of course, the
originals as written in the fifth century,
but are accurate copies, as far
as they have been saved from destruction,
made centuries ago by the
Brehons and <i>ollamhs</i>, and handed
down by them from father to son,
for the Brehon order was hereditary,
and from generation to generation,
until the beginning of the seventeenth
century. Besides this, by their peculiar
wording and reference to contemporaneous
events and opinions,
they bear the undoubted impress of
great antiquity, and of having been
intended for the government of a
primitive people, who had little or no
intercourse with the outside world.
We have thus before us for the first
time a complete body of written fundamental
laws, collected and perfected
over fourteen hundred years
ago by a segregated and peculiar
race, occupying a remote part of Europe,
the only part, in fact, of the
civilized portion of that continent
that never echoed to the tread of a
Roman soldier, or bowed before the
edicts of an imperial Cæsar. In
reading over the laws of that unique
and ancient people, so unlike all we
know of the Roman and Anglo-Saxon
jurisprudence, we find, not without
some regret, we must confess,
that the halo of exalted virtue and
unsullied purity with which the poetic
fancy of subsequent historians and
poets led them to surround their pagan
ancestors, vanishes like the mists
of a summer morning, but we discover
also that the epithets, barbarous,
ignorant, and unlettered, so freely
bestowed on them by the venal
scribes of the dominant race, rest on
no foundation whatever save on the
malice or deficiency of knowledge
of the Anglo-Norman authors. In
truth, the Irish of the pagan era
seem to have had nearly all the virtues
and failings of their posterity of
to-day, the former being brought
more actively into play under the influence
of Christianity, and the latter
repressed by the unlimited authority
of the Catholic Church and the
judicious regulations of the <cite>Senchus</cite>.</p>

<p>We find this more particularly the
case in studying the laws regulating
the domestic relations of the family,
which, being the unit of which society
is but an aggregate, is the most
vital and important part of all human
enactments. Ample provision is made
for the mutual protection of husband
and wife, and the reciprocal rights
and duties of parent and child are
clearly and minutely defined; but
we observe with regret that much of
this portion of the code is occupied
with provisions for the distribution of
property on the disagreement or separation
of married people, and for
other domestic infelicities of a more
criminal nature. The prohibition of
an offence in a statute does not necessarily
imply the frequency of the
commission of the crime itself; but
so much pains are taken to point out
the rights and disabilities of persons
cohabiting without the sanction of
lawful wedlock that the conviction
is forced upon us that they were not
by any means unnecessary. As an
offset to this, however, we find that
a lawful wife was treated with the
greatest indulgence, being in many
ways the equal of her husband, and
in this respect the <cite>Senchus</cite> presents a
marked contrast to all the other European
legislation of that time, by
which woman was held little better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">[639]</a></span>
than a slave, and generally at the
mercy of her father or husband, even
in some instances to the taking of
her life. We feel certain that our
strong-minded sisterhood who are
so manfully battling for social and
political equality will be gratified to
learn that a portion of their principles,
at least, were fully recognized
fourteen centuries ago, and for their
edification we quote the following
passage from the expressed wisdom
of our ancestors:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the connection of equal property,
if with equal land and cattle and household
stuff, and if their marriage state be
equally free and lawful, the wife in this
case is called the wife of equal rank.
The contract made by either party is not
a lawful contract without the consent of
the other, except in cases of contracts
tending equally to the welfare of both;
such as the alliance of co-tillage with a
lawful tribe when they (the couple) have
not the means themselves of doing the
work of ploughing; the taking of land;
the collection of food; the gathering
for the festivals; the buying of breeding-cattle;
the collecting of house-furniture;
the collecting of litters of
pigs; the buying of stacks and other necessaries....
Each of the two parties
has the power to give refection and
feast according to their respective dignity."</p></blockquote>

<p>In case of separation, adequate
protection was thrown around the
wife's rights of property. If her property
were equal to that of her husband
at the time of marriage, she took
an equal moiety of the collective
lands, goods, and chattels, and, in
case of dairy produce and the proceeds
of the loom, two-thirds. If
the property had originally belonged
wholly to the husband, the wife was
entitled to one-third on her separation,
and if it had been her own before
marriage, to two-thirds. Whether
these provisions extended to
their mutual claims after death, we
are not informed by the glossators,
but it is not improbable that they
were, thus creating estates not unlike
the more modern <i>dower</i> and
<i>courtesy</i> of the English law. This
equality of married persons was still
further extended in the right of each
to the disposal or guardianship of
their offspring, and in their authority
to demand in return the assistance
of their children in poverty or decrepitude.</p>

<p>The relations between parent and
child were the subjects of careful
and minute legislation. The father
was obliged to see that his daughter
was educated in a manner becoming
her rank, and, when at a marriageable
age, to procure her a husband of
suitable means and family. In return,
she was to give him one-third of her
first marriage gift (<i>coibhche</i>), and a
certain proportion of other gifts received
after her nuptials. Should the
father be dead, his son, succeeding
him as heir, was also obliged to assume
the same responsibility, and received
from his sister a proper equivalent
at her marriage. The mother's
duty to her son was similar to that
of the father to his daughter, he being
required to assist her in her poverty
or old age, and in conjunction
with the daughter to provide, if necessary,
for both his parents, an obligation
imposed even on grandchildren.
That the father should especially
have care of the daughter and
the mother of the son is something
very contrary to the modern ideas of
domestic discipline, but it doubtless,
in a primitive state of society, had
the advantage of equalizing the
stronger and weaker elements of the
family, giving to the woman the benefit
of manly protection, and to the
rougher masculine nature a gentler
and more humanizing influence.</p>

<p>Fosterage, though not unknown
in other countries, was so general in
ancient and mediæval Ireland as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">[640]</a></span>
give it a character almost peculiar to
that island.</p>

<p>It is known to have been of very
ancient origin, and to have originated
in the natural relations that existed
between the sept or tribe and
its chief, which was one of mutual
rights and duties; for, observes the
<cite>Senchus</cite>, "every head defends its
members, if it be a goodly head, of
good deeds, of good morals, exempt,
affluent, capable. The body of
every head is his tribe, for there is
no body without a head. The head
of every tribe, according to the people,
should be the man of the tribe
who is most experienced, the most
noble, the most wealthy, the wisest,
the most learned, the most truly
popular, the most powerful to oppose,
the most steadfast to sue for profits
and be sued for losses." It will thus
be easily understood, particularly by
the citizens of a republic, that the
authority of a chief, thus qualified,
depended to a great extent on the
affection and good-will of his constituents;
and, in order to create more
close relations between himself and
them, it was customary for him to
send his children at an early age to
be nursed and trained by some family
of his sept. The children thus
placed under tutelage were regarded
with equal, if not greater, affection
by the foster-parents than their own.
The existence of this custom may
still be traced in Ireland, and well-authenticated
instances of the most
self-sacrificing devotion on the part
of the natural child of the foster-parent
to his foster-brother or sister
form the theme of many of our best
Irish stories and historical romances.
The foster-parent for the time being
stood in the place of the actual parent,
and was obliged to feed, clothe,
and educate the foster-child for a
certain number of years, males till
they had attained the age of seventeen,
and females fourteen years,
and the children were expected in
return to compensate, succor, and in
some cases support their foster-parents,
as if they were their actual progenitors.</p>

<p>The statutes regulating fosterage
occupy a large portion of the <cite>Senchus</cite>,
so far as published, and affords
us a fuller and more accurate knowledge
of the social habits and condition
of the Gaelic people in and before
the fifth century than any other
portion of the collection, or even all
the histories of Ireland extant which
profess to treat of that remote epoch.
Fosterage, we are told, was of two
sorts, for affection and compensation.
When the latter, the fosterage price
was regulated according to the rank
of the chief, and varied from three
cows in the case of the son of an
<i>Og-Aire</i>, or lowest chief, to thirty
cows for the son of a king. The
services to be rendered for their payments,
being food, raiment, and education,
were proportioned to the
amount, and seem to have been the
subject of much elaborate legislation,
not easily reconcilable to our modern
notions. For instance, in the matter
of food, Dr. O'Donovan renders a
very ancient commentary on the first
clause of the law of fosterage as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What are their victuals? They are
all fed on stirabout; but the materials of
which it is made, and the flavoring with
it, vary according to the rank of the parents
of the children. The children of
the inferior grades are fed to bare sufficiency
on stirabout made of oatmeal on
buttermilk or water, and it is taken with
stale (salt) butter. The sons of the chieftain
grades are fed to satiety on stirabout
made of barley-meal upon new milk,
taken with fresh butter. The sons of
kings are fed on stirabout made of wheaten
meal upon new milk, taken with honey."</p></blockquote>

<p>According to one authority, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">[641]</a></span>
foster-child should be provided with
two suits of clothing, in color and
quality according to the rank of
his father&mdash;blay, yellow, black, and
white colored clothes for the inferior
grades, red, green, and brown for
the sons of chieftains, and purple
and blue for princes. According to
another, the distinction of rank was
indicated in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Satin and scarlet are for the son of
the king of Erin, and silver on his scabbards,
and brass rings on his hurling-sticks;
and tin upon the scabbards of
the sons of chieftains of the lower rank,
and brass rings upon their hurling sticks....
And brooches of gold having
crystal inserted in them with the sons of
the king of Erin and of the king of a
province, and brooches of silver with the
sons of the king of a territory."</p></blockquote>

<p>The course of instruction to be
pursued by the foster-children was
likewise regulated by the degree of
the dignity of their parents. The
sons of the "lower classes" were to
be employed in "the herding of
lambs, and calves, and kids, and
pigs, and kiln-drying and combing,
and wood-cutting," while the girls
were expected to learn the use of the
<i>quern</i>, or hand-mill for grinding grain,
the useful household art of making
bread, and winnowing corn, etc.; the
young chieftains were to be taught
horsemanship, shooting, swimming,
and chess-playing, and their sisters,
sewing, cutting-out, and embroidery.
We have thus placed before us in all
its simplicity, and upon the best authority,
the modes of living prescribed
for the youth of both sexes in
Ireland at the time of its conversion
to Christianity&mdash;a record valuable to
the historian and the antiquarian, dissipating
alike the poetic imaginings
of too partial Celtic chroniclers and
the voluntary misrepresentations of
the Anglo-Norman writers. It may
be objected that such limited views
of education argued little for the
civilization of the race who entertained
them; but when we recall the condition
of Western Europe at the time
the <cite>Senchus</cite> was composed, we may
well be surprised at the sound sense
and practical wisdom so often found
in its pages. Nor must it be supposed
that the labors of the child ended
with the performance of the tasks
thus assigned him. There existed
another and correlative species of tutelage
called literary fosterage, which
is thus defined in the "law of social
connections":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The social connection that is considered
between the foster-pupil and the literary
foster-father is, that the latter is to
instruct him without reserve, and to prepare
him for his degree, and to chastise
him without severity, and to feed and
clothe him while he is learning his profession,
unless he obtains it from another
person, and from the school of Fenius
Forsaidh onward this custom prevails;
and the foster-pupil is to assist his tutor
in poverty and to assist him in his old
age, and the honor price of the degree
for which he prepares him and all the
gains of his art while he is learning it,
and the first earnings of his art after
leaving the house of his tutor, are to be
given to the tutor."</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to this excellent and
equitable plan of intellectual culture,
we also find in the law of tenures
that the sons of tenants holding
church lands were entitled to receive
instruction from the holders of the
benefices, which, we may presume,
were not necessarily altogether of a
spiritual nature. We thus find that
fosterage constituted one of the most
important elements of society, and,
though much condemned by subsequent
and partial writers, contained
within itself most of the duties and
responsibilities which we now divide
among corporations and individuals
under different names. The
importance which ancient Irish lawgivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">[642]</a></span>
seemed to attach to this crude
but not altogether unsuccessful attempt
to define the relations of parent
and child, employer and employed,
master and scholar&mdash;questions
still raised in this enlightened
age&mdash;is shown in the number of the
statutory enactments originally made,
and the elaborate and critical glosses
afterward appended to them, the whole
not unworthy the notice of the modern
legislator.</p>

<p>The land tenure has always been
a subject of doubt and difficulty in
Ireland, and the laws of the <cite>Senchus</cite>
appear to us as little satisfactory and
as hard to be understood as that recently
passed in the British Parliament
under the supervision of Mr.
Gladstone. It seems to us, from the
careful examination of the different
statutes relating to it, that each chief
held the whole of the land of his
tribe in his own name, not, however,
in his own right altogether, but partly
as trustee of his tribe, and in this
respect the Irish system differs materially
from the feudal, which for
centuries prevailed in all parts of
Europe, except in the country of
which we are writing. The tenants
were divided into two classes, those
who held by <i>saerrath</i> or <i>daerrath</i>,
terms for which we can find no equivalents
in the English language. The
first class received from their chief,
upon taking the land, and without
security, sufficient cattle to stock the
same, for which they were obliged to
return an annual rental in kind, or, at
the chief's option, its value in personal
service and labor, such as working on
his <i>dun</i> or <i>rath</i>, and following him in
his wars. This species of tenure,
except in the case of those who held
immediately from the king, could at
pleasure be turned into holding by
<i>daerrath</i>, by which the tenant gave
security for the stock received, and
was exempt from personal and military
service. The rents and their
manner and time of payment varied
according to circumstances, but always
subject to the above restrictions,
and were, of course, the exclusive property
of the landlord or chief for
the time being. The restrictions on
the alienation of land, or rather of
the good-will of it&mdash;for in fact the
fee did not rest in the individual, but
in the tribe as represented by its
chief&mdash;were many and onerous, including
forfeiture and other penalties,
and were generally directed to the
exclusion of members of neighboring
or hostile tribes. The agrarian portion
of the ancient code, in fact, while
far superior in point of liberality to
that of many of the then existing
nations, resembled more the laws
that govern our Indian reservations
than those of any enlightened country
of the present day. It was full of
fatal and mischievous errors, and to
its baleful operation have been ascribed
many of the evils which centuries
before and after the Anglo-Norman
invasion afflicted Ireland. By jealously
confining the occupancy of a
certain district to one particular tribe
or family, it engendered a feeling of
faction, and what might be called
parish patriotism, which unfortunately
have outlived the cause that gave
them birth, and, by persisting in considering
the tribal land as indivisible,
it destroyed that high sense of independence
and spirit of enterprise
which can only be felt and maintained
by him who owns his own farm
and calls no fellow-man master.</p>

<p>The laws relating to distress, or
the form of collecting claims, such
as debts, tributes, forfeitures, etc.,
are the least attractive and instructive
portion of the work, and for
dense obscurity and incomprehensibleness
can only be compared to
our own Code of procedure. We
gather, however, from them that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">[643]</a></span>
civil claims and damages for injuries
were collectable by a short process
of the seizure of the goods and chattels
of the defendant, and the retention
of the same on the premises of
the plaintiff, or, as in the case of
cattle, in the public pound. After
the expiration of a certain number
of days, if the defendant did not
replevin his property or disprove his
opponent's claim, the goods became
the absolute property of the creditor.
With a humanity, however, which
many suppose to be the growth of
our century, the plaintiff should exhaust
first the property upon the
possession of which the subsistence
of the defendant's family did not
immediately depend, and even some
articles of primary necessity were altogether
exempt from seizure. Imprisonment
for debt, however, partially
existed, and, when the debtor
had no goods and did not belong to
the class of freemen, he was arrested
and compelled to labor for the creditor
until the demands of the latter
were fully satisfied.</p>

<p>Such, in brief, is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">résumé</i> of the
laws contained in the two volumes
of the <cite>Senchus Mor</cite> already published,
and which we hope soon to hear
of occupying a position on the
shelves of every library of reference
in the country. Much yet remains
of the ancient <cite>Code of St. Patrick</cite><a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
to be given to the world before the
entire work is completed, and we are
assured that this will be done at an
early day, and in as scholarly a manner
as the portion before us. We
shall look eagerly for its appearance,
not for its practical value as a legal
study, but as a picture of a remote
but interesting era and race, and as
an additional evidence of how much
the world owes to the Catholic Church
even in the civil and political affairs
of life. The science of true government
has been a plant of slow but
sure growth, and, while we enjoy so
many of its fruits in our favored land,
we must not forget that the seeds
were planted with so much suffering
and labor by the apostolic men who
have gone to their rest centuries ago.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF AN ALGERINE LOCKET.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In the sunshine of a May morning
stood an old gray house, with a porch
draped in woodbine and sweetbrier.
A mass of wisteria climbed to the
very chimneys, and on the lawn a bed
of red and golden tulips swayed with
the soft breeze. A wren was building
in an acacia and singing, while
a young girl watched his work and
sang also, trying with her fresh soprano
voice to catch his melody.</p>

<p>The old house was the homestead
of Holly Farm, and the young girl
was Sybil Vaughan, the heroine of a
very short story.</p>

<p>"Sybil looks charming in white,"
thought Miss Mildred, sitting at the
window of the green parlor with her
mending-basket beside her; "and the
locket is quite becoming."</p>

<p>It was before the day when every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[644]</a></span>
one began to wear medallions, and
the one that hung by a quaint twisted
chain from Sybil's neck was a
locket of rich enamel, brought to her
from Algeria by a midshipman cousin,
and quite unlike our gewgaw
from the Palais Royal.</p>

<p>As we have said, Miss Mildred sat
at the window of the green parlor,
raising her eyes now and then from
her work to watch her pretty niece,
her adopted daughter. During the
seventy years of her life, she had sat
at that same window almost every
morning since she was old enough
to work a sampler, or to read a paper
in the <cite>Spectator</cite> or a chapter of
<cite>Evelina</cite> to her mother and younger
sisters.</p>

<p>In her girlhood, Holly Farm had
been a lonely place, remote from
town and village. The trees, now
rising luxuriantly around the house,
were then, like her, in their youth,
and revealed whatever might be
passing in the lane below the lawn.
At a period of life when young people
gaze abroad in vague expectation
of some wonderful arrival or event
that shall alter the current of existence,
Mildred Vaughan had turned
longing eyes toward this lawn hour
after hour, and she had thought her
morning's watch well rewarded if the
old doctor had trundled by in his
high-topped chaise and nodded to
her in friendly greeting.</p>

<p>With a capacity for painting that
in these days of potichomania, decalcomania,
and the rest would have
passed for originality, if not genius,
she had received one quarter's lessons
in oil-painting, and by dint of studying
a few beautiful family portraits
had acquired a keenness of perception
that made her hunger for the world
of art. With an earnest love for
books, she had been obliged to
devote her time to the care of her
younger brothers and sisters. And
so, out of her monotonous life, she
had brought into old age an exaggerated
idea of the value of learning
and luxury, with a belief in possibilities
and a regret for what might have
been generally supposed to belong
exclusively to youth.</p>

<p>This sounds more melancholy than
it really was. Miss Mildred had
kept her ideal of happiness fresh and
vivid, and that is in itself a source
of keen enjoyment. And, being a
devout and trusting soul, she had
framed for herself a prayer out of
the thwarted aspiration of her heart
and mind: "I thank thee, Lord,
that there are joys so beautiful on
earth, and I thank thee that they are
not for me. Thy will is dearer to
me than the realization of any dream."</p>

<p>Every one loved to come to Miss
Mildred for sympathy. She believed
in the reality and the durability
of their joy, in the depth and in the
cause of their grief. She did not say
to the mother who had lost her little
baby, "He is saved from sorrow
and sin." She did not say to the
young widow, "You have had the
best part of life; later come trial and
vexation of spirit." She knew that
in bereavement the balm often enters
with the sting; that the stainless
beauty of the thing we lose is our
only earthly consolation for its loss.</p>

<p>A great change had come to Holly
Farm since the time when the doctor's
visit was an important event.
The sweep of meadow-land west of
the house now served as camping-ground
for the &mdash;th Regiment, Massachusetts
Volunteers, in which
young Henry Vaughan held a second
lieutenancy. Drumming and fifing,
the arrival of carriages full of gayly
dressed people to visit the camp,
the music of the regimental band on
moonlight evenings, such was the
course of daily life on green slopes
which cattle and sheep had once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[645]</a></span>
possessed without dispute, nibbling
the grass and drinking from the river
in all contentment.</p>

<p>Indeed, Miss Mildred's standard
of events had so naturally changed
in that course of seventy years that,
when the little white gate swung
open, and a young man in uniform
walked across the lawn, she merely
said to herself: "That must be Captain
Adair coming to see Harry. He
walks better than any man I ever
saw. The maid's hanging out
clothes; I do hope Sybil will have
sense enough to come and speak to
him instead of letting him knock."</p>

<p>Sybil had the amount of sense requisite
for the emergency. She led
the way into the green parlor, and,
leaving Captain Adair with her aunt,
went to announce the arrival to her
brother, who was trying on his new
uniform, and blushed to be caught
admiring the epaulettes before a
mirror in the library. There was no
need of apology. Sybil was in full
sympathy with the occasion, and
returned to the parlor feeling as
proud of her brother's military outfit
as he of the beauty of the sister leaning
on his arm.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant meeting. Adair's
frank and sympathetic manner had
won its way through Miss Mildred's
reserve; and his familiarity with the
world and its ways secured him an
easy victory over his young lieutenant.
Sybil was less impressionable
than the other two. Her manners
were gentle and courteous to all, but
it was not easy to penetrate her likes
and dislikes, or to find out their
cause. Just a trifle uninteresting, she
was, poor Sybil, like many nicely
poised young persons before they
have enjoyed or suffered keenly.
The very finish of her beauty, of her
lovely manners, of her pleasant voice
and accent, left nothing to be desired&mdash;no
suggestion of anything beyond.
But a soul so brave, so pure
and honest as hers deserved to be
developed, and the occasion for development
came.</p>

ADAIR'S LETTERS TO HENRY
ALLEYNE.</h3>


<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Camp Everett</span>, May, 1861.</p>


<p>I had an adventure yesterday that
should have fallen to your lot, my
dear Alleyne, not to that of a prosaic
dog like me.</p>

<p>Hearing that my second lieutenant
lived near the camp, and that he
could not enter upon his duties for
a day or two, I took it into my head
to go and see what stuff he was made
of, for, Alleyne, I am awfully interested
in Company B, and in every
creature connected with it. How
could I ever have lived in that bore of
a city, or slept within four walls, or
used a silver fork! "Going off at
half-cock, as usual," you say? Well,
perhaps that is better than never going
off at all. But to return to my
story.</p>

<p>I went through a shady lane, leading
from the camp to Vaughan's
house. (Vaughan is the second lieutenant
and owner of the camping-ground.)
As I drew near the gate, I
heard a woman's voice singing. A little
further on came a gap in the trees,
and I took a reconnoissance&mdash;such
another I can never hope for during
my military career. A low-spreading
stone house, covered with vines, stood
among fine old trees. Great bunches
of blue blossoms draped the walls,
and on the velvety lawn were clusters
of brilliant flowers. Beneath a
tree, honor bright, Alleyne, if ever
angels do appear in white gowns with
broad rose-colored sashes, it was an
angel that stood beneath that tree,
answering a bird with a voice as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">[646]</a></span>
fresh, an expression as natural as his
own. I stood there looking and listening&mdash;it
was really very fascinating&mdash;until
I suddenly remembered my
errand. Then I pushed open the
gate, and, walking across to the porch,
lifted the bright brass knocker. But
the rival of the wren, without letting
me wait the coming of some creature
of baser clay, came from among
the trees, and asked if I wished to
see Mr. Vaughan.</p>

<p>Now, I had wished to see Mr. Vaughan,
and as it would not do to say
on so short an acquaintance that my
wishes were too completely satisfied
by the vision before me to leave any
want unfulfilled, I stoutly declared
that I did wish to see Mr. Vaughan,
and that I was Captain Adair.</p>

<p>And then she showed your too susceptible
friend into a summer parlor,
where the general effect was white
and sea-green, and where there were
hanging-baskets of flowers surrounded
by vines and soft moss, and where
an elderly lady in a lavender dress,
with white lawn apron and kerchief,
sat sewing, and where portraits of
rosy-fingered dames and periwigged
gentlemen gazed on us from the
walls and read our destinies&mdash;mine
must have been too plainly legible
on my ingenuous countenance. And
the old lady received me very courteously,
and the maiden went to find
her brother, and, when the brother
came, he looked like his sister, and
surely never before was lieutenant
greeted by his superior officer with
such ineffable tenderness. And we
dined, so far as I could judge, off
dishes of topaz and crystal, heaped
high with ambrosia, and soon after
dinner I returned to Camp Everett,
and met the colonel going his rounds.</p>

<p>"You come from young Vaughan's,
I see," he said. "What impression
did he make upon you?"</p>

<p>"Charming, highly delightful, very
promising," I replied, with a happy
combination of diffidence and child-like
openness of manner.</p>

<p>He gave me a look out of his
shrewd old eyes. "So attractive a
person will be an acquisition to the
regiment," he remarked, and let me
pass on to my tent.</p>

<p>I am half-asleep. Good-night!</p>


<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Robert Adair.</span></p>


<p class="p2 signature"><span class="smcap">Camp Everett</span>, June, 1861.</p>

<p>Things go on grandly at the camp,
and between ourselves the colonel
has just said that Company B is better
disciplined than any other in the
regiment&mdash;a compliment I'm very
proud of, coming, as it does, from an
old West Point martinet.</p>

<p>And now for the second part of
my idyl. Every afternoon, Vaughan
and I go up to his place and smoke
awhile in the orchard. Then, by
accident&mdash;it is wonderful, the unerring
accuracy of accident at times&mdash;we
appear at the east window of the
green parlor, and there are Miss
Vaughan and her niece, sewing or
drawing, and sometimes Miss Sybil
sings, to the accompaniment of a
charming Pleyel piano, canzonets of
Haydn in a style as fine, as pure, as
exquisite as the composition. She&mdash;Sybil,
I mean&mdash;has never danced a
German or heard <cite>Faust</cite>! Duly
shielded by the presence of aunt or
brother, she is sometimes taken to
hear the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Nozze di Figaro</i> or to see
<cite>Hamlet</cite>, or to some other unexceptionable
afternoon entertainment. I
smile sometimes to see her absolute
ignorance of life, and wonder that,
in a village not twenty miles distant
from a city where the world runs
riot, this being has sprung into womanhood,
unconscious of the existence
of anything less spotless than
herself.</p>

<p>This guarded life has given to her
manners a certain high breeding that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[647]</a></span>
would keep one at a distance but for
her kind, frank nature. No one can
venture to fancy himself distinguished
above others.</p>

<p>Do you know what this makes me
feel? That hitherto, and I am nearly
twenty-five years old, I have looked
at women with a coxcomb's eyes.
Any day, any hour, I feel ready to
throw myself on her mercy, but an
instinct tells me that her love must
be won by something better than professions.
When I have suffered in
the cause she loves well enough to
give her only brother to defend it,
then I will speak.</p>

<p><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Noblesse oblige</i>&mdash;I see that in a certain
lofty sense this is the motto of
her life, and it shall be mine. Do
you remember what our dear old
philosopher used to say in the scientific
school? "The better you begin,
the harder is the work before
you." And when we asked what he
meant, he only said, "Noblesse oblige."
It is true, whether the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse</i>
acts upon us in the form of intellectual
strength or of spiritual gifts, or
in the old material sense of inherited
rank.</p>

<p>Except the hour spent at Vaughan's
each day, and an occasional visit to
my mother in town, I am wrapped
up in the affairs of Company B. The
life here is to me most fascinating.
You would laugh to see me with a
set of wooden soldiers before me on
the little table in my tent, studying
manœuvres, extricating my company
from the most astounding and unheard-of
perplexities. The progress
of my lieutenants; the health, morals,
and immorals of the company;
the incapacity of our bugler to draw
the faintest sound from his instrument&mdash;in
short, everything that indicates
growth or decay of discipline
in Company B, seems to me a matter
of national importance.</p>

<p>One word more about Miss Sybil
Vaughan. My mother has seen her,
and sympathizes with me. When she
came to visit the camp, I took her
to Vaughan's house to rest. As we
left Holly Farm, she gave a sigh of
relief, and said: "Robert, I feel as
though I had stepped back half a
century. When I was a girl, young
ladies were like Miss Sybil Vaughan."</p>

<p>One more last word. In your letter
you said, with an air of superior
wisdom, plainly expressed in the tails
of your letters: "You are in love."</p>

<p>Of course I am, and I should be
a fool if I were not.</p>


<p class="in4">Your friend,</p>
<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">Robert Adair</span>.</p>



<h3>III.</h3>

<p>It was June still. The laburnum
path was all aglow with blossoms,
and the grape-walk, just beyond,
made a shadowy retreat toward evening.
Sybil was sitting there with
her work lying on her lap. She had
not sewed three stitches. Why had
not Harry come as usual that afternoon
to the east window to get his
cup of black coffee? Why&mdash;O
dear! there are so many whys in the
case, and never an answer anywhere.
Why was there an indefinite air of
bustle in the camp as she looked
down on it from her bower? Why
was there an undefined sense of stir
in everything?</p>

<p>She watched the sun drop nearer
and nearer to the distant hills. The
air was full of saffron light, and heavy
with the perfume of flowers. Nature
was so new and fresh in her
June loveliness; and life was full of
a promise of coming beauty, as it had
never been before to Sybil in any
other of her nineteen Junes. That
sense of stir was in her own soul no
less than in external nature.</p>

<p>There came the click of an iron
heel upon the gravelled path. Sybil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[648]</a></span>
half-rose from the bench, and then
sank back again. Adair stood before
her. "We are ordered off," he said.
"We go in an hour. I've but one
moment to stay, for I promised Harry
to leave him time to come and
say good-by."</p>

<p>In the white, scared look on Sybil's
face he read the right to speak.</p>

<p>But it had all been so hurried, she
thought, when he was gone. Oh! for
one of those minutes to return, that
she might express to him a tenth
part of the joy and pain, the hope
and terror, that filled her heart. She
could remember nothing clearly or
in order, and yet she would have
given all the other memories of her
happy life to recall each word as it
was spoken. He had asked her to
give him something of her own, a
ring, a glove, a ribbon, no matter
what. And she had taken from her
neck the medallion, and laid in it a
little curl of her hair, and given it to
him; and she had felt his hand upon
her head, and heard him say, "God
keep my sweet, innocent love!" And
when she lifted her head he was
gone, and she had told him nothing.
It could not be a dream, for on her
left hand was the ring he placed
there&mdash;one that she had seen him
wear, and thought too beautiful a
jewel for a man to have, but now she
felt so glad that he had worn it. He
had said this was to be the guard of
the wedding-ring that he would place
there as soon as he could get a furlough
to come home; and she had
said&mdash;yes, thank God! she did remember
saying that, at least&mdash;she
had said that no one but himself
should take off this ring or put another
in its place; yes, thank God!
she had said it.</p>

<p>Then Harry had come, too overjoyed
at the news of her engagement
to feel the pain of parting. That
memory was full of turmoil; mixed,
too, with self-reproach that all other
emotion was so lost in her new joy
or pain, whichever it might be called,
that Harry's going gave her no
uneasiness.</p>

<p>The sun dropped behind the hills;
star after star pierced through the
darkening blue. Stillness lay on the
valley below, so lately full of tramping
horses, and shouting men, and
shifting lights.</p>

<p>At last she heard her aunt's voice
calling her, and roused herself to go
and tell her beautiful story, old as
the human race, new as that very
June evening. She wondered that
Aunt Mildred understood it all so
well. Short-sighted Sybil! it was
you who were beginning to understand
Miss Mildred.</p>

<p>One August day, when a sultry
fog held the earth in bondage, and
scarlet geraniums blazed like red
pools among the wilted grass, Miss
Mildred pushed open the little white
gate, and, with that hurried step that
in old age so poorly simulates speed,
hastened across the lawn. She gave
a quick glance into the two parlors
which were vacant, and then went
up-stairs, grasping nervously the low
hand-rail. In the upper hall she
stopped, and leaned against the balustrade
to take breath, and courage,
too. Then, opening the door of Sybil's
room, she stopped on the threshold
to see her lying on the floor
with a newspaper crushed in her
hand. A bulletin in the village post-office
had told her all: "Found dead
on the field, Captain Robert Adair,
&mdash;th Regt. Mass. Vols." They lifted
Sybil up and laid her on her bed.
She did not "strive nor cry," but in
that first grief it pleased God to
measure her power of endurance.</p>

<p>It was not in victory that Adair
had fallen, but in one of those engagements
where, humanly speaking,
life seems thrown away. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[649]</a></span>
such thoughts should not disturb the
mourners cradled in the providence
of God. He chooses the time and
the occasion, and what is lost in the
current of human events he gathers
up and cherishes.</p>

<p>Weeks passed away. Letters came&mdash;precious
in their recognition of
Adair's high integrity, his courage,
his compassion; letters, too, from
his mother, far away in her summer
home, acknowledging Sybil as one
with her in love and bereavement.
But she lay, white and listless, on her
bed, taking little notice of anything
except in the expression of gratitude.
Harder than anything else for her
aunt to bear was the pathos of Sybil's
resignation.</p>

<p>There came a soft afternoon, early
in September, when for the first time
Sybil's easy-chair was placed in the
open air, under a striped awning that
made an out-door room on the west
side of Holly Farmhouse. Here she
could be sheltered from the direct
rays of the sun, and yet enjoy the
trees and flowers.</p>

<p>Great velvet bees hid their heads
buzzing in the freshly-opened cups
of the day-lilies; a hummingbird
dipped his dainty beak into the
sweet-peas, and then flashed away
to hide himself among the nasturtiums
pouring in a golden stream
over a broken tree-trunk on the
lawn.</p>

<p>Amid the glow of nature, Sybil
looked very wan and frail. She had
begun to think a little now, and her
thoughts ran thus: "I am resigned
to God's will. I've not the shadow
of a doubt that this is all right. I
am more than willing to die; I am
willing to live, if only there is a thread
to hold by&mdash;a stone, a stick, a straw
to begin to build my life upon. Other
women have borne this and lived.
I've seen them going about among
their fellow-creatures, talking, smiling,
laughing, when others talked,
and smiled, and laughed. I have
no more sensibility than they. What
I have lost was perfect; but what
they had lost was perfect, perhaps,
to them. I don't rebel, but I am
dying of pain. It goes on, and on,
and on; if it would stop but for ten
minutes and let me take breath, I
think I could catch hold of something
on earth and begin to live again.
There's that dear Aunt Mildred coming
through the hall. Now, I <em>will</em>
give her a free, happy smile, and
lighten her burden if I cannot lighten
my own."</p>

<p>Miss Mildred held in her two hands
a great vase of spreading golden-rod,
which she set down on the little garden-table.
Just where she had placed
it, against a background of dark-green
leaves, it made so beautiful a picture
that Sybil uttered an exclamation of
surprise and pleasure. There was a
delighted look on her aunt's sweet
old face that made her think: "Here
is something to hold on by; here is
something to build on, if only I am
generous enough to try."</p>

<p>Miss Mildred arranged the cushions
in Sybil's chair, and then took her
hand very gently.</p>

<p>"There is a man in the hall, dear,
who brings you a little packet from
Virginia. Can you see him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; at once, if you like. Please
let him come out here. I can talk
to him better in the open air."</p>

<p>He came&mdash;a shy, elderly man,
whom Sybil remembered seeing
once at the camp. He stood awkwardly,
shifting his military hat from
hand to hand, till she asked him to
sit down near her, and said a few reassuring
words. Then, seeing that
he was struggling to conquer his
emotion, she fixed her eyes on the
vase of flowers, trying to keep down
the impatience struggling within
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[650]</a></span></p>

<p>"My name is Abel, lady," he said,
at length. "May be you've heard
the cap'n say as how I couldn't play
the bugle, at the camp below there.
The folks all said I couldn't learn, I
was so old and dull; but he allus believed
everybody was good for something,
he did."</p>

<p>Sybil was leaning forward, breathless
to hear more.</p>

<p>"I remember you," she said. "Oh!
do go on. Tell me everything&mdash;every
little thing about it all."</p>

<p>"Wall, you see, lady, my two boys
they was all I had, and they jined the
regiment, and I couldn't live without
'em; and I was hale and strong, and so
I made bold for to jine, too. There
was one place left in the regiment
then&mdash;the bugler's place, in Company
B&mdash;and I pled so hard, the
cap'n he said I might try. And,
lady, the plaguy thing used to seem
to shut right up when I wanted to
make it blow, and the men used to
laugh at me, right out afore my boys.
And Abner and John Henry they
felt kind o' cheap, and they kept sayin'
to me, 'Father,' they says, 'it
makes us feel kind o' bad to hear
you tryin' so hard and not learnin';
don't you think you'd better give it
up?' And says I, 'No, boys,' says
I, 'while there's breath in my
body, I won't give it up till I've
conquered that crittur.' And, lady,
when the cap'n see me tryin' so
hard and allus comin' to grief, what
does he do but he takes hold himself,
and he learns all them signals,
and he teaches on 'em to me. And
so I went to the war with my boys,
and I nursed John Henry through a
fever, and I kept Abner from fallin'
into bad company; and, lady, if I
could have saved the cap'n's life by
givin' my skin inch by inch, I'd have
done it; but I couldn't. So I just
held his head against this old heart,
and let him breathe his life away.
And I laid him down on the sod as
tender as if I'd been his mother."</p>

<p>"May God reward you! Did he
suffer much?"</p>

<p>Tears, such as she had longed for,
were pouring from her eyes.</p>

<p>"No, lady; he was gone before
the surgeons came on to the field.
He lay quite still, without a moan or
sigh; and, now and then, he'd say a
word to me. I was wounded, too,
just below the knee. I dropped
down about six feet off from him;
and when the retreat came, and I
saw as how I was left behind with
the cap'n, didn't I praise the Lord!"</p>

<p>"What did he say to you?"</p>

<p>Abel took a little packet from his
breast, and laid it in Sybil's hand.
"He says to me, 'Abel,' says he,
'when you can get a furlough <em>honorable</em>,'
says he&mdash;'for you mustn't go
when the country needs you bad&mdash;you
take this locket' (a-unhookin'
it from his neck) 'to Miss Sybil
Vaughan&mdash;her that lives in the stone
farmhouse above our old camp at
Holly Farm&mdash;and you tell her as
how the poor thing tried to save my
life; and she'll see it by the great
dent in the gold made by a bullet.
And you tell her as how she's to
open it herself, and see what I put
there. And you tell her '&mdash;I'm a
Methodist, lady, but I'll tell you
word for word what he said."</p>

<p>"Yes, word for word."</p>

<p>"'You tell her,' says he, 'how I
pray that Christ and his Blessed
Mother may be her comfort as they
are mine; and tell her as how I've
never let a thought enter my mind,
since we parted, that she wouldn't
have approved. And tell her,' says
he, a-raisin' himself half-way up
from the ground, 'you tell her I
love her fond and true, and that we
shall meet in heaven when she's
done the work on earth she is so
fit to do. And tell her to comfort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[651]</a></span>
my mother. Poor mother!' And
then he put his arm round my neck,
and kind o' stroked my cheek, and
he says, soft and low, a few words,
and all I heard was, 'Receive my
soul,' and then I kissed him, and laid
him down on the turf, and his face
was like as I think it will be in heaven
at the great day. And now I'm
goin' to leave you, lady, 'cos I know
as how you want to be alone. And,
with your leave, I'll come again, and
tell you how we loved him, and how
we cried like babies round the ambulance
that brought him to the camp;
and how there was scarce anything
left to send home to his mother, 'cos
he used to give his things away to
the sick boys&mdash;blankets, and money,
and shirts, and all."</p>

<p>Then Abel took Sybil's delicate
hand reverently on his broad, brown
palm, and kissed it.</p>

<p>"Lady," he said, "you're the only
thing ever I see that was fit to mate
with him."</p>

<p>"You will come again," she said.
"As you have no daughter, and there
must be many things needed to make
you comfortable during your convalescence,
you will let me see to all
that. And you will let me replace
the many things you must have lost
or worn out during these hard three
months?"</p>

<p>She spoke beseechingly, looking
up into his face like a child pleading
for a toy.</p>

<p>"You shall just wind me round
your finger like he did," said Abel.
"I allus thought I'd got grit in me
till I seen him, and then it seemed as
though I hadn't no will but his'n."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sybil was alone with the little
packet. With trembling fingers she
untied the string and removed the
wrappings of paper. There lay the
medallion with its twisted chain.
She passionately kissed the battered
enamel that had stood between him
and death. Then she opened the
locket. With the silky, yellow curl
lay a little lock of dark-brown hair.
She was touching it tenderly, wondering
when he had placed it there
for her consolation&mdash;whether just before
the skirmish or soon after he left
her&mdash;when a turn of the locket in the
level rays of the sun showed two
words scratched on the inner side with
some rude instrument. She looked
closer, and read: "Noblesse Oblige."</p>

<p>When Miss Mildred came to lead
her into the house, there was a change
in her face that filled the gentle lady's
heart with gratitude. It was the look
of courage that comes to those who
recognize the claim of their high birth
as the children of God.</p>

<h2>THE SPIRIT OF CATHOLIC ASSOCIATIONS.</h2>

<p class="center"><small>TRANSLATED FROM THE CIVILTA CATTOLICA.</small></p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>All societies have aims, more or
less remote, which they aspire to realize.
Catholic societies have an object
which they also strive to accomplish.
Theirs is the victory of the
church over the modern Islamism, the
enemy of all religion and civilization,
commonly called the Revolution.
This monster, once obtaining control
of the state, fills nations with ruins,
and in its proud ferocity ever threatens
new disorders and fresh streams
of blood. Catholic associations, in
order to be victorious, must pass over
the dead body of this powerful enemy.
There is no other way. The
enterprise is difficult, requires great
courage, absolute generosity, and endurance
capable of every trial. But
they will win the day; they will yet
sing the hymn of triumph; for they
march to the battle and fight it in
the proper spirit: that is, the Catholic
spirit. The victory will be theirs;
but only on conditions.</p>

<p>Reason proves it. The labor of a
society must be proportioned to the
end proposed, as the force must be
adequate to the effect intended. It is
impossible that an army can win a
battle if the necessary discipline, obedience
to officers, and courage be
wanting. So with Catholic associations.
Their object, being a religious
one, a crusade which purposes to assure
the triumph of Catholic doctrines
and institutions, it is impossible for
them to act with vigor, to bear the
fatigue, stand the brunt of their adversaries'
onslaught, conquer their
errors, and subdue their forces, unless
they are moved, animated, and fortified
by the spirit which is peculiar
to Catholic associations. If they
march to the combat with inadequate
forces or lax discipline, they
will only become objects of derision
to their enemies.</p>

<p>What is the spirit of Catholic societies?
It is the spirit of faith. Sacred
phalanxes of a religion whose
foundation is faith; restorers of principles
that are derived from faith;
protectors of institutions based on
faith&mdash;how can they do battle if their
minds be not animated with the spirit
of faith, if their deliberations be
not inspired with it; if their works
be not its visible effects? Yes; the
spirit of faith is the peculiar spirit of
Catholic associations; it is their essence,
their qualifying property, and
the secret power which impels the
Catholic onward to the heroism of
virtue. Give us Catholic associations
animated by a spirit of living,
fervid faith, and great acts will not
be slow in production. Examples
of it may be seen in the immense
and sublime temples erected when
the spirit of faith burned in the
breasts of our forefathers, to whom
it was only necessary to propose the
plan in order to have it carried out;
and in those chivalrous bands of
knights who armed themselves
against Mohammedan fury, and fell
pierced by numberless wounds on
the ground given them to defend, but
never yielding an inch to the foe.</p>

<p>Catholic associations imbued by a
spirit like this need not fear the power
of their adversaries, nor heed their
numbers. Faith in the conflict is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[653]</a></span>
buckler which cannot be broken, the
shield which cannot be pierced, the
flag which counts as many victories
as the battles fought under its folds.
Let all the members of Catholic associations
march to the contest clothed
in this armor, and they will be
invincible. St. Paul advised this to
the Thessalonians and to the Ephesians.
This also was the counsel of
St. John.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> What more do we want?
Does not St. John tell us that faith
and victory are synonymous terms?
"<i>For whatsoever is born of God overcometh
the world: and this is the victory
which overcometh the world, our
faith.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It must be remembered, however,
that this spirit of faith must not be a
blind spirit, or march to battle with
uncertain steps. Associations actuated
by such a spirit prosper slowly;
without purpose, and consequently
without success. The reason is
plain, for it is certain that the
more thoroughly influenced is a
human mind by a motive, the more
earnestly will it strive to obtain an
object. It is, therefore, evident that
the spirit of Catholic associations
must be an enlightened spirit, thoroughly
knowing what it wants.
The Revolution&mdash;great mistress in
the arts of hypocrisy, great employer
of every species of argument in its
favor through the license of the press,
great seducer by the advantages
which it proposes&mdash;if it does not
always succeed in catching real Catholics
in its net, at least sows such
prejudices in the minds of some as
will make them less hostile to its
work or less earnest in the defence
of Catholicism, which is another
name for truth and justice. This
is the first danger to be shunned
by Catholic associations. The Catholic
societies must not let themselves
be seduced by the seductive
monsters of the revolution. The
quality and natural goodness of the
tree is not known so well by its leaves
as by its fruit. It is, therefore, necessary
to go deeper than the mere
extrinsic forms to penetrate the substance
of the work done by the revolution.
Oh! how many motives
to spur on to action would Catholics
find in such an investigation! A
rapid glance will convince them of
this fact.</p>

<p>Observe the religious order. Let
the Catholic associate consider, in
this regard, a country in which the
revolution has made progress. He
witnesses the most impious and most
lamentable scenes; the church deprived
or curtailed of liberty, insulted
in her ministers, attacked by literary
barbarians, by trammelling laws, or
infamous writings; her destruction
sworn, Christ impugned in his doctrines,
derided in his sacraments, his
divinity denied; God excluded from
laws, banished from the school; men
grouped in hostility to him, shouting,
in full daylight under the banner of
the free-thinkers, like a horde of savages,
"There is no God!"</p>

<p>Pass to the social order. Here a
new spectacle of grief is presented.
Every effort is used to take away
from the community its common belief
and to plunge individuals into the
vortex of incredulity; a black cloud
of practical errors, moving over the
nations, abolishing the restraint of
conscience, rendering the populace
the slaves of the vilest and most
truculent passions; the basis of all
authority, human and divine, sapped;
the most powerful governments
crumbling to dust, and threatening
to fall a prey either to perpetual
anarchy or brutal tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[654]</a></span></p>

<p>Consider the nature of the means
employed. What a sad view! Perpetual
conspiracies, shameless treasons,
frauds and deceptions, lies and
calumnies, unmitigated oppression
and violence. Furnished with these
weapons, the revolutionary bands
war on God, on Christ, and on his
church. The revolution, like a
shameless woman, blushes not at
its crimes, but glories in its success.</p>

<p>Consider the results. Every religious
conviction blotted out, the principles
of morality annihilated or obscured,
authority destroyed, and consequently
a society springing up composed
of men without certainty in
regard to their end, without any
immutable law to restrain them,
without any bond of affection to
unite them. Hence, we have the
unrestrained indulgence of the passions,
egotism the universal law,
force and cunning the only arms,
and mutual demolition the consequence.
The old French revolution
proves it; the modern one of
Paris confirms it. The revolutionary
Guéroult himself attests it in stating
that the Parisian insurrection "is
disorder, destruction, self-abandonment,
the putrid decomposition of a
society without belief, without compass
Or ideal."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> The results of the
revolution may be summed up in one
phrase: it makes men beasts, and
society bestial.</p>

<p>A Catholic association which considers
these effects of the revolution
in the light of faith, appreciating the
means employed and the sad results,
cannot act remissly. It is not possible;
it must rise in the name of the
rights of God, of Christ, of the church;
in the name of that religious belief
which is attempted to be taken
from the people, and the principles
of moral reason; it must rise full of
shame for society, which tolerates
such horrible abuses and crimes. It
will rise to repair these defects with
gladness. The spirit of faith, strengthened
by the motives proposed, will
spur it on in its efforts. The Catholic
associations of Germany are undoubtedly
energetic; so are those of
Austria; but the secret of their force
is found in the fact that the men who
lead them are men of strong faith and
of great prudence and intelligence.
This is evident from their congresses,
in their speeches and newspapers.
Catholic associations in other lands
would do well to imitate them.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The motives just proposed are
powerful, but their source is disagreeable.
There are others more
pleasant to consider. Among these
latter is the nobility of the end proposed
by Catholic associations. This
is not, as has been calumniously
stated, to revenge the defeat of a
certain political order, or to satisfy
natural restlessness. Catholic associations,
vivified by the true spirit of
faith, do not stoop so low. They
aim at things far higher. The name
which they bear, the rules which they
profess to follow, the works already
accomplished where they have been
established, attest it. Their particular
object is to drag men, made slaves by
the revolution, out of the mire of incredulity
and immorality into which
false principles have plunged them.
They strive to re-establish society on
the true bases of truth and justice,
to restore tranquillity to peoples disturbed
by the passions of party and
the fury of false teachers. They aim
to reclaim for God the obedience
which is his due, the honor which
belongs to Christ, the rights taken
from the church; to give true liberty&mdash;the
liberty of the Gospel&mdash;to all;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">[655]</a></span>
to draw men away from the carnal
happiness proposed to them by the
revolution; and to make them seek
that beatitude which every rational
Christian should desire. The revolution
threatens everything&mdash;religion
in society and among individuals;
the Catholic associate declares himself
their champion.</p>

<p>Such is the noble aim of Catholic
associations; hence the nobleness
of the conflict in which they are engaged.
What is this conflict? It is
the struggle of truth against error,
of right against might, of civilization
against barbarism, of duty to God,
Christ, and his church against impiety,
blasphemy, and injustice. The
revolution means the renewal among
men of the revolt of Lucifer and his
angels; the Catholic associations are
the faithful cohorts of God and his
Christ. Their war-cry is that of St.
Michael: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quis ut Deus et Christus
ejus?</i> Who is like to God and his
Christ?</p>

<p>This war-cry has been explicitly
recommended in the New Testament.
The words are given by St. Matthew,
St. Mark, St. Luke, and plainly referred
to by St. Paul. "Whoever," says
Christ, "confesses me in the midst of
this sinful and adulterous race, whoever
makes public profession of my
doctrine, will be recognized by me
before the angels, before the tribunal
of my Father in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Does
not the present generation publicly
boast of making a divorce between
itself and God and Christ? Giving
loose rein to passion under the specious
names of liberty of conscience
and the preaching of licentious doctrines,
modern society is plunging into
the abyss of iniquity. Hence, the
Catholic associates must rise courageously
in the midst of this generation,
confess Christ openly, publicly
affirm his doctrines, and defend them
in the face of his enemies. The Catholic
associates must revive the
praises of Christ; to them are his
divine promises addressed, to them
belong the irrevocable guarantees of
being placed near the throne of his
Father. Combating bravely and bearing
themselves like true champions
of the religion of Christ, their fate is
not and cannot be doubtful.</p>

<p>Let the Catholic associations, therefore,
advance courageously to the
fight, bearing the banner of Christ
against the standard of the revolution.
Humanity, liberty, progress,
light, are written on the adverse flag,
but they are stolen words. In the
mouths of the revolutionists they are
lies. The flag of humanity is not
that which destroys its rights, but
that which defends them; nor of <em>liberty</em>,
that which makes men slaves of
their passions instead of freeing them;
nor of <em>progress</em>, that which has no aim,
but that which leads to something definite;
nor of light, that which begets
obscurity in the intellect, destroying
its most obvious principles, but that
which illuminates intelligence with
divine revelation. This latter is the
banner of Catholic associations, consequently
it is the flag of humanity,
of liberty, of progress, the standard
of light.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The forces of Catholic associations
must act in concert. It is not enough
that their members be vigorous and
animated with an ardent faith. There
must be harmony of intelligence
among them. Woe to the society
whose members have different principles
or contradictory plans! Like a
machine whose wheels do not move
harmoniously, ruin will result. There
must be uniformity of principles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[656]</a></span>
thorough harmony of intelligence if
the Catholic associates hope to obtain
great successes.</p>

<p>Harmony in generalities is easy;
but not so in particulars. If you ask
a Catholic assembly what it wants,
all the members will reply, "The propagation
and triumph of Catholic
principles." But if you descend to
particular enquiries, you may meet
difficulties that close the way to success;
disputes about fixed principles
must therefore be eliminated from Catholic
associations.</p>

<p>These associations are in the first
place essentially laic, therefore it is
not their business to decide questions
of principle. Their aim is a practical
one, namely, to annul the efforts
of the revolution, to introduce the
principles of Catholicity where they
do not exist, and strengthen them
where they do. It is not of their
competence to determine them. They
are called Catholic, therefore, in case
of doubt, they must recur to the
teaching church and accept her decisions.
We repeat: the Catholic associations
must keep within the bounds
imposed by their very nature and title,
and then there will be no collision
of views, no wasting of precious
time in useless disputes, no schisms
and separations; but, with all the
force of a strong faith, they will advance
with dignity, security, and success
in their undertakings.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this, we quote
an apposite passage from the discourse
pronounced by his eminence,
Cardinal Schwarzenberg, in the general
congress of the Catholic associations
held at Prague in 1860. "The
object of Catholic associations," says
the eminent prelate, "is to take measures
to introduce and assist the
teaching, the principles, the precepts,
and the desires of the church in the
schools, in the life of the citizen and
of the family, among merchants and
men of business. Their duty is to
support the teaching church by counsel
and co-operation. Their duty is
also to acknowledge with joyful mind
the doctrines of the church, to follow
them, defend and sustain them."</p>

<p>Who does not admit the great
good performed by the Catholic associations
of Germany in the course
of the few years during which they
have been established? And if we
study the reason of their success, we
shall find it in the undisturbed harmony
of their views. The spirit of
"liberal Catholicism" tried to influence
them, but in vain. Their associates,
mindful of their title and of
their duty to the pastors of the
church, and especially to the Roman
Pontiff, obey his instructions without
subtle distinctions and commentaries,
and employ their talents properly in
securing their prosperity.</p>

<p>An instance of their Catholic zeal
is found in the letter sent to the
Pope by the assembly held at Innsbrück
preparatory to the general congress
of the German Catholic societies
in 1867. In that letter we read as
follows: "On the 9th, 10th, and 11th
of September, with the consent and approval
of the most reverend Bishop
of Brixen, the Catholics of Innsbrück,
the capital of the Tyrol, will be
gathered together in order to defend
courageously their religion as far as
God and their strength will allow; and,
the errors and lies of vain men being
rejected, such errors as your holiness
has pointed out and condemned with
fulness of authority in your encyclical
letters, in order also to take
salutary counsel required by the
character of the times and circumstances,
so as to promote the growth
of Catholic life and charity, under
the patronage of the Blessed Virgin
Mary. An immense war, as you, Holy
Father, have expressed it, is waged
against divine revelation, against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[657]</a></span>
Catholic Church, against the apostolic
see, against good morals and
Christian charity, the queen of all the
virtues. While this war rages, every
Catholic becomes a soldier of Christ;
<i>but we cannot carry on a good and
just war if we do not cling with all the
ardor of our soul to the apostolic see,
fastened to that rock which God has
placed in Rome; and if we are not
helped and sustained by your supreme
authority and your efficacious blessing;
wherefore, we</i> earnestly <i>desire from our
very inmost hearts to venerate</i>, follow,
and obey you, <i>the Vicar of Christ</i>,
you, the chief pastor of the whole
flock of the Lord, you, father of all
the faithful. This is the unanimous
feeling of all those who will be assembled
in September at Innsbrück;
this is the universal desire; and, all
animated by this thought, God will
defend the Christian doctrine and
Christian charity."</p>

<p>Let these be the sentiments of all
Catholic associations that may spring
up; let this be their programme and
the foundation of their constitution.
The spirit of prompt submission to
the teaching of the church should
animate them. This is a simple consequence
of the first element of Catholic
life. Christ never said to any
theologian, erudite man, learned historian,
or particular society, "Be ye
masters of the church, and let her
hear you;" but he did say so to the
bishops and to the pope in the person
of the apostles and of Peter.
Only one blinded by his own pride can
deny this fundamental principle of
the Catholic religion. The spirit of
prompt obedience to lawful authority
is the secret which alone will render
Catholic societies capable of success.</p>

<p>But harmony of intelligence is not
the only means by which Catholic
associations can manifest their spirit.
There must be unity of feeling and
co-ordination of will, elements essential
to every society.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>A Catholic association which
possesses the spirit of submission to
the teaching church, and possesses
harmony of intelligence, is on the right
road, and may hope to prosper in its
undertakings. But how often does
it happen that a serious impediment,
an insurmountable barrier, stops the
progress of a brave legion and disappoints
the well-founded hopes of victory!
Here is a danger which the
best-intentioned Catholic association
may encounter; an obstruction, an
invincible barrier, which may arise
from the unexpected disagreement
of wills. Agreement of wills is essential
as well as harmony of intelligence.</p>

<p>It is evident that, in order to maintain
this agreement, we must remove
the causes which might disturb it.
There are two sources of discord; one
arising from the internal relations of
a society. The intellects may agree
on the principles to be sustained,
and the wills consent as to the end
proposed; but the task is for the
members to choose the same means
and put them in practice. Here
may arise the discord. Some project
or design is proposed. It is debated.
The dispute waxes warm. Hard
words are interchanged. The majority,
of course, carry the project; but
the minority may disagree and refuse
to co-operate in its execution.
Hence disaffection, schisms, and secessions
in the association. What is
the root of all these troubles? It is,
in one word, pride, the root of all
schisms. One thinks himself more
learned, of greater rank or of more experience
than the others, therefore he
will not be led by their judgment
but by his own self-conceit. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[658]</a></span>
trouble is small in the beginning, but
it may produce disastrous results.
What is the remedy? It is to bring
to every discussion the true Catholic
spirit of abnegation and of sacrifice.
Whims and prejudices must be laid
aside for the sake of harmony and
the noble cause to be defended. Our
God is a God of peace, not of commotion
and disturbance. The best
plan is not always that suggested by
our weak judgment. Provided the
plan of the majority be a good one,
though it may not be the most perfect,
still, for peace sake, let us adopt
it, according to the advice of Xavier,
that it is better to accept a unanimous
plan, though not the best, rather
than a perfect one which would
cause dissensions among our brethren.</p>

<p>The second cause of dissensions
may be in the external relations of
the associates. This would be the
more dangerous, because the occasion
of it might be an apparent external
good to be effected. The will of the
bishop or of the pastor may not
agree with the desire of the society.
In a case of this kind, if the society
should act in spite of the episcopal
will or opposed to it publicly, a great
scandal would happen in the diocese,
and the society would fall to pieces.
What is the remedy for such calamities?
The associates must have filial
reverence and obedience for the
pastors of the church. Then all difficulties
will cease. This is required
by the very object of the association,
which is to aid the bishops in religious
matters; it is also required by
the dignity of the bishops, since the
Holy Ghost has called them to be
rulers in the church. His holiness
Pius IX. clearly teaches that this
should be the bearing of Catholic societies
toward their pastors, in his answer
to the Catholics of Innsbrück.</p>

<p>Here we may quote what a bishop
said in the general congress held to
condemn the proceedings of the so-called
German Catholic liberals.
These gentlemen, under the appearance
of doing good, had expressed
their usual lamentations about the
storms that threatened the church,
the danger to her future freedom, unless
the laity were allowed a greater
influence in religious matters; to deny
them this influence, as had been
done so far, would be to render them
inert and careless about church matters.
Such were the complaints&mdash;complaints
of the discontented son who
is trying to deprive his mother of
complete control of the house&mdash;subtle
revolutionary complaints against
the authority of the hierarchy. The
Bishop of Brixen, answering them,
said, "What kind of influence do laymen
want in the church? To control
dogma? They cannot. Discipline?
They cannot. Influence of
the laity is too vague a conception,
and, besides, a useless one. In order
that it should produce benefits, its
limits should be determined, its conditions
explained. But it is well
known that the chief among them is
faithful dependence on the teachings
and authority of the church, since
the words of the apostle suit individuals
as well as the whole church:
'The just man lives by faith.' The
life of the church requires nothing
but what comes from faith. Hence,
when the church finds a layman who
manifests his faith in his words and
actions, she honors him, salutes him
with joy as a co-operator not having
belied the words of the apostle of
love: Let us be co-workers of truth,
co-operators in propagating and
strengthening it, and in assuring its
triumph. In every age there have
been many such men, like our modern
Catholic associations, and for this reason
we protect them, salute, esteem
them; and the best proof of our love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[659]</a></span>
for them is that we have hastened to
come to this solemn congress of lay
associations, assembled to defend
Catholic interests." Thus spoke the
learned prelate. In conclusion, a
Catholic society must not touch on
dogmatic subjects, nor interfere in
affairs pertaining to ecclesiastical discipline:
it should observe proper respect
and obedience toward its bishops,
and then the bishops will aid,
bless and sustain it.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>The parts of a machine, in order
to act in concert, must be united according
to mechanical laws: so associations
must obey the laws of order.
They must have co-ordination of
forces. In this consists the peculiar
advantage of association. Each one
has its constitution and by-laws. Let
it observe them, adapting them to
the wants and peculiarities of each
nation. The difficulty is really not
in enacting laws for it, but to keep
them in vigor.</p>

<p>The associates must have the spirit
of order. Then the execution of
laws will be easy. Such a spirit will
make each member mind his own position;
each officer act in his own
sphere without infringing on the rights
of others. The object of the association
being to act with united forces,
this purpose cannot be effected by a
disorderly mass of individuals, acknowledging
no obedience to a local
or general superior. Each particular
society will become jealous of its
neighbor, unless all agree to obey
implicitly a central committee. Private
utility and individuality must
be sacrificed to the public good; jealousy,
self-love, personal advantage,
these three causes that tend to disrupt
the co-ordination of the common
forces, must be sacrificed to the
common welfare, and to the end for
which the association was established,
as it is an elementary rule of order
that the private must be sacrificed
for the public good. For this
reason we consider that society best
in which the strictest bonds are maintained
between the members and the
centre or head. Does not union
make strength? A necessary consequence
is that the force is proportioned
to the union. Baron Stillfried,
a name dear to Catholics by reason
of his fervid zeal for religion, rendering
an account of what the Confraternity
of the Archangel St. Michael,
founded in Vienna in 1860, had done,
confessed that, owing to dissensions
among the members, and the consequent
lack of union of forces, the results
had been relatively few. On
the contrary, who does not admire
the wonderful success obtained by
the Catholic <i>Casini</i> of Austria in favor
of the pontifical cause, owing to
their unity of purpose and union of
forces? They obliged the president
of the council to receive their complaints;
they obliged the chancellor
of the empire to excuse himself; they
moved all the Catholic populations
to such a spirit of action in favor of
religion, tied down by the iniquitous
laws of the revolution, that all the
journals of the secret societies bellowed
and blasphemed like lunatics,
fearing the destruction of their nefarious
designs.</p>

<p>The multiplicity of Catholic interests
gives rise to many associations
differing according to the difference
of their aims. Should this diversity
have no common bond of union? By
no means. Some have for object
matters of essential importance, as,
for instance, the freedom of the
church, her right to educate, and the
independence of her head. In regard
to these subjects, all the associations
should unite. Is it necessary
to prove this? Is it not self-evident?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[660]</a></span>
Associations that would act
differently would resemble those Chinese
troops which neglected the defence
of the most important posts,
contenting themselves with guarding
places of secondary importance.</p>

<p>Catholic societies are not bands of
conspirators, they do not excite rebellions,
nor use violence or deceit
to gain their purpose. These arts
are left to the revolutionists. Catholics
need no weapons but truth and
justice. They must be ready to die
for both. But they must act legally,
they must not violate the civil order.
Consequently, they should never undertake
a work without first being
satisfied of its lawfulness.</p>

<p>In this way success is certain; for
in modern civil society public opinion
rules. If Catholic societies defend
religion, who can object? For
public opinion must admit their right
to do so, provided they violate no laws
of the state.</p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>But although legality is required
for Catholic associations, they must
not be timid or cowardly. They
must be brave and magnanimous.
Christ teaches us to be magnanimous,
for he gave his blood and life for the
love of truth and justice; the martyrs
in millions died for the same
cause. We must imitate them. No
difficulty or obstacle must balk the
zeal of a Catholic association. No
fatigue or danger or sacrifice must
be too great for the Catholic associate.
The soldier of Christ must
conquer difficulties. The present
conflict, said Monsignor de Ketteler,
in the congress of the Catholic associations
of Trèves, needs champions
who, for the love of Christ, dare expose
themselves to the attacks of
newspapers and demagogues, to calumny
and terms of contempt in parliament
and from the rostrum. The
Catholic spirit must be a self-sacrificing
and a magnanimous one. Every
associate must be a Catholic before being
a politician, a Catholic before being
a man of letters, a Catholic above
all things. He must never be discouraged,
but persevere with generous
constancy, in spite of the attacks
of enemies, or the seeming want of
success of many of his efforts. Let
the Catholic associates remember
that they are fighting under the very
eyes of God; and that their struggles,
even though not always successful, are
a manifestation of their faith before
men which will be rewarded in heaven.</p>


<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>We say this on the supposition that
the combined forces of the association
should produce no result. But
this supposition is unfounded. Let
the Catholic association remain constant
in its enterprise, and it will
make a new step to victory every
day. It may fail in this or that particular
measure, but the general
cause will prosper. We know that
the heads of the secret societies speak
in this way, but they do so to deceive.
We do not, for our words are
founded on solid reasons.</p>

<p>The first is drawn from the nature
of the two causes in conflict. The
revolution is the cause of error and
injustice; Catholicism is the cause
of truth and justice, consequently
the cause of Catholicism is conformable
to the nature of man, formed for
the true and the good, while the
cause of the revolution is in contradiction
with man's nature. How
can any nature remain long in a
state of contradiction with itself?
Passion or ignorance may obscure
for a time the human intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[661]</a></span>
but when the contradiction is felt
and known, nature revolts against it
with all its power, and frees itself.
Now, as the associations in the interest
of the Catholic faith are striving
to enlighten our intellect with the
light of truth, and to repress the
force of passions by inculcating the
love of virtue, the necessary effect of
such labor must be that the cause of
the revolution will daily lose ground
as the light of truth, becoming more
apparent, shows the falsity of certain
principles. The more the Catholic
associations combine in illuminating
the human intelligence and correcting
the dormant moral sense of society,
the more will the Catholic
cause hasten towards triumph.</p>

<p>Reason teaches this. But revelation
offers other proofs, for it gives
us the promises of Christ. These
are expressed in those passages in
which our Lord likens his doctrines
to the little leaven which leavens the
whole mass; and when he tells his
apostles to trust in him, the conqueror
of the world.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Let the Catholic
associations, therefore, advance
in their work with confidence. They
have divine promises in their favor.
The false and iniquitous doctrines of
the revolution will fall to the ground.
Its efforts will be in vain, its success
only local or temporary; for the
friends of truth and of human rights
will finally conquer. The best instincts
of human nature and the promises
of faith are with them.</p>

<p>The Holy Ghost tells us by the
pen of St. Paul that truth must conquer
in the end, speaking of the
saints "who triumphed over the
powers of earth, closed the mouths
of lions, were invincible in the combat,
and conquered their enemies."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
The children of the revolution, having
a presentiment of their defeat by
the new Catholic associations, have
already cried To arms! and in a
thousand ways manifested their fear.
Yes, the victorious future belongs to
the Catholic associations. Let them,
therefore, arise with courage grounded
on the principles of faith, strengthened
by the noble motives of their
enterprise. Harmony of intelligence,
the spirit of submission to the
church, agreement of wills, with the
spirit of sacrifice, and of reverence for
their pastors, will make them serried
battalions, moving according to law,
with magnanimity, constancy, and
confidence in God, irresistible in their
attacks. Let them fight on the battle-field
of faith, and the world will
soon know that the proud pomp of
the revolution and its thousand war-cries
are founded only on falsehood
and deceit.</p>

have narrated, M. Massy no longer

The emperor did not fail to send
him to the first prefecture which became
vacant in the empire. By a
remarkable coincidence, this prefecture
proved to be that of Grenoble.
Baron Massy left Our Lady of
Lourdes only to meet Our Lady of
La Salette.</p>

<p>Jacomet also left the department,
and was appointed chief of police
elsewhere. Re-established upon his
chosen ground, he contributed with
great sagacity to the detection of
some dangerous criminals who had
baffled the efforts of his predecessor
and the active search of the police.
The crime was a great robbery committed
upon a railroad company, and
amounting to several hundred thousand
francs. This was the point of
departure in his fortunes as a police
agent, his true vocation. His remarkable
ability, appreciated by his superiors,
raised him to a higher place.</p>

<p>The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procureur impérial</i>, M. Dutour,
was also speedily called to other
functions. M. Lacadé still remained
mayor, and his shadow will yet appear
once or twice in the latter pages
of our story.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Although he had instituted the
tribunal of examination towards the
end of July, still, before permitting it
to begin its work, Mgr. Laurence
desired a more peaceful state of the
public mind. "To wait," he thought,
"will not compromise God's work,
since he holds all time in his hands."
The issue proved that he was right.
For after the stormy discussions of the
French press and the violent proceedings
of Baron Massy, the grotto
finally became free, and there was
no longer fear of the scandal of seeing
police agents arresting the episcopal
commission on its way to the
Massabielle rocks in order to fulfil its
duty, and examine the traces of
God's finger at the very place of the
apparition.</p>

<p>On the 17th of November, the
commission went to Lourdes. They
examined the seer. "Bernadette,"
says the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</i> of the secretary,
"presented herself before us with
great modesty, and, nevertheless, with
remarkable confidence. She appeared
calm and unembarrassed in the midst
of the numerous assembly, in presence
of distinguished ecclesiastics,
whom she had never seen, but of
whose mission she had been made
aware."</p>

<p>She described the apparitions, the
words of the Blessed Virgin, the order
given by Mary to build a chapel
in her honor, the sudden breaking
out of the fountain, the name, "Immaculate
Conception," which the vision
had given to itself. She set forth
all that was personal to herself in
this supernatural drama with the
grave certainty of a witness fully convinced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">[663]</a></span>
and the humble candor of a
child. She answered every question,
and left no obscurity in the mind of
those who interrogated her, no longer
in the name of man, as Jacomet had
done, but in the name of the Catholic
Church. Our readers are already
aware of the substance of her testimony.
We have, in former pages, narrated
events in the order of their date.
The commission visited the Massabielle
rocks. It beheld the great
volume of the miraculous fountain.
It established, by the testimony of
the neighboring inhabitants, that no
spring existed there before the time
when it broke forth in the presence of
the multitudes under the hand of the
ecstatic seer.</p>

<p>At Lourdes and in other places
they made studious inquiry into the
miraculous cures worked by the
water of the grotto.</p>

<p>In this delicate task there were two
parts, entirely distinct. Human testimony
determined the facts themselves;
but their natural or supernatural
character depended, for the most
part, on the verdict of medical science.
The method followed by the
tribunal was inspired by this twofold
thought.</p>

<p>Throughout the dioceses of Lourdes,
Auch, and Bayonne, the commission
summoned before it the subjects of
these singular cures. It cross-examined
the minutest details of their sickness,
and their sudden or gradual
restoration to health. It brought in
human science to put those technical
questions of which theologians, perhaps,
would not have thought. It
summoned the relations, friends,
neighbors, and other witnesses of the
different phases of the event, to confirm
evidence. Having once come
to a certainty of all details, it submitted
facts to the judgment of two
eminent physicians admitted as colleagues.
These physicians were Dr.
Vergès, superintendent of the baths
at Barèges, Fellow of the Medical
Faculty of Montpellier, and Dr.
Dozous, who had already, out of
private interest, given his attention
to several of these strange incidents.
Each physician gave in his report his
personal opinion regarding the nature
of the cure, sometimes rejecting the
miracle, and attributing the cessation
of disease to certain natural causes;
at other times declaring its utter inexplicability
without the action of a
supernatural power; and, lastly, sometimes
not arriving at any conclusion,
but remaining in doubt as to the true
explanation. Thus prepared by the
double knowledge of facts and the
conclusion of science with respect to
them, the commission deliberated,
and finally pronounced its judgment
to the bishop, and submitted the
evidence.</p>

<p>The commission had not and
could not have any preconceived
opinions. Believing on principle in
the supernatural, which is always to
be met with in the history of the
world, it knew, also, that nothing so
tends to discredit the true miracles
of God as false prodigies worked by
men. Equally indisposed to deny
or affirm anything prematurely, having
no brief to sustain either for or
against the miracle, it was confined
strictly to the task of examination
and sought only the truth. It appealed
to every source of light and
information, and acted in full view of
the public.</p>

<p>It was as open to unbelievers as
to those who believed. Resolved to
discard remorselessly all that was
vague or uncertain, and to accept
only incontestable facts, it rejected
every declaration based upon hearsay.</p>

<p>It imposed two conditions upon
every witness: first, to testify only
to what came under personal knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[664]</a></span>
and observation; secondly, to
state under oath the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth.</p>

<p>With such precautions and an organization
so prudent and wise, it
would have been impossible for a
false miracle to deceive the judgment
of the commission. It would
have been impossible, in the face of
the hostile criticism of those who
were bent upon combating and
overthrowing every error and even
the least exaggeration, to sustain
any doubtful assertion or the miraculous
character of any doubtful fact.</p>

<p>If, then, true miracles, imperfectly
proved, failed in obtaining the sanction
of the commission, it is absolutely
certain that no false prodigy
could stand before its searching examination.</p>

<p>Whoever had the means of contesting
any one of the miracles&mdash;not
by vague and general theories, but
by facts and personal knowledge&mdash;was
thereby summoned to appear
against it. Not to do so was to
give up the case, and acknowledge
that no formal or intelligible counter-evidence
could be sustained. When
passions run high in the ardor of a
long struggle, parties do not let judgment
go by default. To refuse the
combat is to accept defeat.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>During several months, the episcopal
commission visited the houses
of those whom public notoriety designated
as objects of the miraculous
cures subjected to its examination.
It established the truth of many
miracles. Several of them have already
found a place in our history.
Two were quite recent. They had
taken place shortly after the prefect
had withdrawn his prohibition and
the grotto had been reopened. One
was at Nay, the other at Tartas. Although
the recipients of these heavenly
favors were mutually unacquainted,
a mysterious bond seemed
to connect both events. Let us relate
them in order as we have personally
studied them, and written
down what we have heard under the
impressions produced by the living
testimony.</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In the town of Nay, where young
Henry Busquet had been miraculously
cured a few months before, a certain
widow, named Madeleine Rizan,
was at the point of death. Her life
had for twenty-four or twenty-five
years been an unbroken series of
pain and sorrow. Having been attacked
by the cholera in 1832, her
left side had remained almost entirely
paralyzed. She was quite lame,
and could only move a few steps inside
her house, and that only by supporting
herself against the walls or
furniture. Two or three times a year,
in warm weather, she was able to go
to Mass at the parish church of Nay,
not far from her dwelling. She was
unable, without assistance, either to
kneel or to rise. One of her hands
was totally palsied. Her general
health had suffered no less than her
limbs from this terrible scourge. She
frequently vomited blood, and her
stomach was unable to bear solid
food.</p>

<p>Beef-tea, soup, and coffee had,
however, sufficed to keep up the
flame of life, ever flickering and unable
to warm her feeble body. She
often suffered from icy chills. The
poor woman was always cold. Even
in the heats of July and August, she
always wished to see fire in the grate,
and to have her arm-chair wheeled
close to the hearth.</p>

<p>For the last sixteen or eighteen
months, her state had been much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[665]</a></span>
aggravated; the paralysis of the left
side had become total. The same
infirmity had begun to attack the
right leg. Her paralyzed limbs were
greatly swollen, as happens in the
case of dropsy.</p>

<p>Madame Rizan left her chair to
take to her bed. She could not
move, such was her weakness, and
they were obliged to turn her, from
time to time, in her bed. She was
almost an inert mass. Sensibility
was gone as well as motion.</p>

<p>"Where are my legs?" she used to
inquire, when any one came to move
her. Her limbs were drawn together,
and she lay continually on one side
in the form of a Z.</p>

<p>Two physicians had successively
attended her. Doctor Talamon had
long since given her up as incurable,
and, although he continued to
visit her, it was only as a friend. He
refused to prescribe any remedies, saying
that drugs and medicines would
prove fatal, or, at best, only enfeeble
her system.</p>

<p>Doctor Subervielle, at the repeated
instance of Madame Rizan, had prescribed
some medicines, and, soon
finding them utterly useless, had also
given up all hope. Although her
paralyzed limbs had become insensible,
the sufferings which this unfortunate
woman experienced from her
stomach and head were terrible.
Owing to her constantly cramped
position, she was afflicted by two
painful sores&mdash;one in the hollow of
her chest, and the other on the back.
On her side, in several places, her
skin, chafed by the bed-clothes, exposed
the flesh, naked and bleeding.
Her death was at hand.</p>

<p>Madame Rizan had two children.
Her daughter, Lubine, lived with and
took care of her with the greatest devotion.
Her son, Romain Rizan, had
a situation in a business-house at Bordeaux.</p>

<p>When the last hope was gone, and
Doctor Subervielle declared that she
had only a few hours to live, they
sent in haste for her son, Romain
Rizan. He came, embraced his mother,
and received her last blessing
and farewell. Then, obliged to leave
by a message peremptorily recalling
him&mdash;torn by the cruel tyranny of
business from his mother's death-bed&mdash;he
left her with the bitter conviction
that he should never see her
more. The dying woman received
extreme unction. Her agony went
on amid excruciating sufferings.</p>

<p>"My God!" she often murmured,
"I pray thee to end my torments.
Grant me to be healed or to
die."</p>

<p>She sent to ask the Sisters of the
Cross, at Igon, where her own sister-in-law
was superior, to make a novena
to Our Lady for her cure or
death. The sick woman also evinced
a desire to drink some of the water
of the grotto. One of her neighbors,
Madame Nessans, who was going to
Lourdes, promised to fetch some of
the water when she returned. For
some time past, she had been watched
day and night. On Saturday, October
16, a violent crisis heralded the
near approach of her last moment.
She was continually spitting blood.
A livid hue spread over her worn features;
her eyes became glassy. She
no longer spoke, except when forced
by excessive pain.</p>

<p>"O my God! how I suffer! O
Lord! would that I might die!"</p>

<p>"Her prayer will soon be granted,"
said Doctor Subervielle as he
left her. "She will die to-night, or
at least before the sun is fairly up.
There is only a little oil left in the
lamp!"</p>

<p>From time to time the door of
her chamber opened. Friends, neighbors,
and priests, the Abbé Dupont
and the Abbé Sanareus, vicar of Nay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">[666]</a></span>
entered and softly inquired if she
were still alive.</p>

<p>Her friend and consoler, the Abbé
Dupont, could not restrain his tears
as he left her. "Before morning she
will be dead, and I shall see her again
only in paradise," he said.</p>

<p>Night fell, and solitude gradually
took possession of the house. Kneeling
before a statue of the Blessed
Virgin, Lubine prayed without any
earthly hope. The silence was profound,
and broken only by the difficult
breathing of the invalid.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight. "My
daughter!" cried the dying woman.</p>

<p>Lubine arose and approached the
bed.</p>

<p>"What do you wish, mother?"
she asked, taking her hand. "My
dear child," answered the dying mother,
in a strange voice that seemed
to come from a heavy dream, "go to
our friend Madame Nessans, who
was to have returned from Lourdes,
this evening. Ask her for a glassful
of the water from the grotto. This
water will cure me. The Blessed
Virgin wishes it."</p>

<p>"Dear mother," answered Lubine,
"it is too late to go there. I cannot
leave you alone. Besides, everybody
is asleep at the house of Madame
Nessans. But I will go early in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Let us wait, then." The invalid
relapsed into silence. The long
night finally passed.</p>

<p>The joyous bells at last announced
the day. The morning Angelus as it
rose carried up to the Virgin Mother
the prayers of earth, and celebrated
the eternal memory of her all-powerful
maternity. Lubine hastened to
Madame Nessans's, and soon returned
with a bottle of water from the
grotto.</p>

<p>"Here, mother! Drink! and may
the Blessed Virgin come to your
help!" Madame Rizan raised the
glass to her lips, and swallowed a
few mouthfuls.</p>

<p>"O my daughter! my daughter!
It is life that I am drinking! Here
is life in this water! Bathe my face
with it! Bathe my arms! Bathe
my whole body with it!"</p>

<p>Trembling and almost beside herself,
Lubine moistened a piece of
linen with the miraculous water, and
bathed her mother's face.</p>

<p>"I feel that I am cured!" she
cried in a voice now clear and strong.
"I feel that I am cured!"</p>

<p>Lubine meanwhile bathed with
the wet linen the paralyzed and
swollen limbs of the invalid. Trembling
with mingled joy and terror, she
saw the enormous swelling disappear
under the rapid movement of her
hand, and the stretched and shining
skin reassume its natural appearance.</p>

<p>Suddenly, completely, and without
transition, health and life revived
beneath her touch.</p>

<p>"It seems to me as if burning
pimples were breaking out all over
me." It was, doubtless, the principle
of disease leaving for ever under
the influence of a superhuman will.
All this was over in a moment. In a
couple of minutes the body of Madame
Rizan, apparently in her agony,
bathed by her daughter, recovered
the fulness of strength.</p>

<p>"I am cured! perfectly cured!"
cried the happy woman. "Oh! how
good the Blessed Virgin is! Oh!
how powerful she is!"</p>

<p>After the first burst of gratitude
toward heaven, the material appetites
of earth made themselves keenly felt.</p>

<p>"Lubine, dear Lubine, I am hungry.
I must have something to eat!"</p>

<p>"Will you have some coffee, some
wine, or some milk?" stammered her
daughter, confused by the suddenness
and astounding character of the miracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[667]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want to have meat and bread,
my daughter. I have not tasted any
for twenty-four years." There happened
to be some cold meat and
some wine near at hand; Madame
Rizan partook of both. "And now,"
said she, "I want to get up."</p>

<p>"It is impossible, mother," said
Lubine, hesitating to believe her
eyes, and fancying, perhaps, that
cures which come directly from God
are subject, like other cures, to the degrees
and dangers of convalescence.
She feared to see the miracle vanish
as suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p>Madame Rizan insisted and demanded
her clothes. They had been
for many months carefully folded and
packed in the wardrobe never to be
worn again. Lubine left the room
to find them. Soon she re-entered.
But as she crossed the threshold, she
uttered a loud cry, and dropped the
garment which she was bringing.
Her mother had sprung out of bed,
during her absence, and there she
was, before the mantelpiece, where
she kept a statue of the Blessed Virgin,
with clasped hands returning
thanks to her all-powerful deliverer.</p>

<p>Lubine, as frightened as if she had
beheld one risen from the dead, was
unable to help her mother to dress.
The latter, however, put on her
clothes in an instant without any assistance,
and again knelt down before
the sacred image.</p>

<p>It was about seven o'clock in the
morning, and the people were going
to the early Mass. Lubine's cry was
heard in the street by the groups
who were passing under the windows.</p>

<p>"Poor girl!" they said, "her mother
is dead at last. It was impossible
for her to survive the night."
Several entered the house to console
and support Lubine in this unspeakable
affliction, among others two
sisters of the Holy Cross.</p>

<p>"Ah! poor child, your good mother
is dead! But you will certainly
see her again in heaven!" They
approached the young girl, whom
they beheld leaning against the half-opened
door, her face wearing a
stupefied look. She could scarcely
answer them.</p>

<p>"My mother is risen from the
dead!" she answered, in a voice choked
by strong emotion.</p>

<p>"She is raving," thought the sisters,
as they passed by and entered the
room, followed by some persons who
had come up-stairs with them.</p>

<p>Lubine had spoken the truth. Madame
Rizan had left her bed. There
she was, dressed and prostrated before
the image of Mary. She arose,
and said: "I am cured! Let us all
kneel down, and thank the Blessed
Virgin."</p>

<p>The news of this extraordinary
event spread like lightning through
the city. All that day and the day
after the house was full of people.
The crowd, agitated and yet recollected,
pressed to visit the room into
which a ray of the all-powerful goodness
of God had penetrated.</p>

<p>Everybody wished to see Madame
Rizan, to touch the body restored to
life, to convince his own eyes, and
grave upon his memory the details
of this supernatural drama.</p>

<p>Doctor Subervielle acknowledged,
without hesitation, the supernatural
and divine character of this cure.</p>

<p>At Bordeaux, meanwhile, Romain
Rizan awaited in despair and anguish
the fatal missive announcing
his mother's death. It was a great
shock to him when, one morning,
the postman brought him a letter
addressed in the well-known hand of
Abbé Dupont.</p>

<p>"I have lost my poor mother!"
he said to a friend who had just come
to visit him. He burst into tears,
and dared not break the seal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[668]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take courage in your misfortune.
Have faith!" said his friend.</p>

<p>Finally, he opened the letter. The
first words which met his eyes were:</p>

<p>"<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deo gratias!</span> Alleluia!</p>

<p>"Rejoice, my dear friend. Your
mother is cured&mdash;<i>completely cured</i>.
The Blessed Virgin has restored her
miraculously to health." The Abbé
Dupont then went on to relate the
divine manner in which Madame Rizan
had found at the end of her agony
life instead of death.</p>

<p>We may easily fancy the joy of the
son and of his friend. The latter
was employed in a printing-house at
Bordeaux, where was published the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messager Catholique</i>. "Give me that
letter," said he to Romain. "The
works of God ought to be made
known, and Our Lady of Lourdes
glorified."</p>

<p>Partly by force, and partly by entreaty,
he obtained the letter. It
was published a few days afterward
in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messager Catholique</i>.</p>

<p>The happy son hastened to Nay
at the earliest moment. As he arrived
in the diligence, a woman was
waiting to greet him. She ran swiftly
to meet him, and, when he descended
from the coach, threw herself
into his arms, weeping with tenderness
and joy. It was his mother.</p>

<p>A few years afterward, the author,
while searching out the details of his
history, went in person to verify the
report of the episcopal commission.
He visited Madame Rizan, whose
perfect health and green old age excited
his admiration. Although in
her seventy-first year, she has none
of the infirmities which that age usually
brings. Of her illness and terrible
sufferings there remains not a
trace; and all who had formerly
known her, and whose testimony we
gathered, were yet stupefied at her
extraordinary cure.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> We wished to
see Doctor Subervielle. He had been
dead some years.</p>

<p>"But," we asked a clergyman of
Nay, who acted as our guide, "the
invalid was attended by another physician,
Doctor Talamon, was she
not?"</p>

<p>"He is a very distinguished man,"
replied our companion. "He was
in the habit of visiting Madame Rizan,
not professionally, but as a friend
and neighbor. But after her miraculous
cure he ceased his visits, and
did not make his appearance for
eight or ten months."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," we rejoined, "he wished
to avoid being questioned on the
subject, and being obliged to explain
this extraordinary phenomenon, which
would certainly have been out of
accord with his principles of medical
philosophy?"</p>

<p>"I do not know how that may
have been."</p>

<p>"No matter; I want to see him."</p>

<p>We knocked at his door.</p>

<p>Doctor Talamon is a tall and handsome
old man, with an expressive
and intelligent countenance. A remarkable
forehead, a crown of white
locks, a glance which betokens positive
adherence to opinions, a mouth
varied in expression, and on which
a sceptical smile often plays&mdash;these
are the features which strike one who
approaches him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">[669]</a></span></p>
<p>We stated the object of our visit.</p>

<p>"It is a long time," he answered,
"since all that happened, and, at the
distance of ten or twelve years, my
memory supplies but a dim recollection
of the matter about which you
inquire; besides, I was not an eye-witness
of it. I did not see Madame
Rizan for several months, and, consequently,
do not know by what conditions
or agents, or with what degree
of speed or slowness, her recovery
was effected."</p>

<p>"But, doctor, did you not have
curiosity enough to investigate such
an extraordinary event, of which rumor
must have instantly informed
you, especially in this place?"</p>

<p>"The fact is," he answered, "I am
an old physician. I know that the
laws of nature are never reversed,
and, to tell you the truth, I do not
believe the least bit in miracles."</p>

<p>"Ah! doctor, you sin against the
faith," cried the abbé who had accompanied
me.</p>

<p>"And I, doctor, do not accuse
you of sinning against faith, but I
accuse you of sinning against the
very principles of the science which
you profess."</p>

<p>"How, pray, and in what?"</p>

<p>"Medicine is not a speculative, but
an empirical science. Experience is
its law. The observation of facts is
its first and fundamental principle.
If you had been told that Madame
Rizan had cured herself by washing
with a decoction from some plant
recently discovered on yonder mountain,
you would not have failed to
ascertain the cure and to examine
the plant, and put the discovery on
record. It might have been as important
as that of quinine in the last
century. You would have done the
same if the cure had been produced
by some new sulphurous or alkaline
substance. But, now, everybody is
talking about a fountain of miraculous
water, and you have never yet
been to see it. Forgetting that you
are a physician, that is to say, a
humble observer of facts, you have
refused to notice this, as did the scientific
academies which rejected
steam and proscribed quinine on
some quack principles of their own.
In medicine, when fact contradicts a
principle, it means that the principle
is wrong. Experience is the supreme
judge. And here, doctor, allow
me to say that, if you had not
had some vague consciousness that
what I am telling you is true, you
would have rushed to find out the
truth, and would have given yourself
the pleasure of showing up the imposture
of a miracle which was setting
the whole neighborhood wild
with excitement. But this would
have exposed you to the danger of
being forced to surrender; and you
have acted like those party-slaves
who will not listen to the arguments
of their opponents. You have listened
to your philosophical prejudices,
and you have been false to the
first law of medicine, which is to face
the study of facts&mdash;no matter of
what nature&mdash;in order to derive instruction
from them. I speak freely,
doctor, because I am aware of your
great merits, and that your keen intellect
is capable of hearing the
truth. Many physicians have refused
to certify to facts of this nature,
for fear of having to brave the
resentment of the faculty and the
raillery of friends of their profession.
With regard to yourself, doctor, although
your philosophy may have
deceived you, human respect has had
nothing at all to do with your keeping
aloof."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," he replied, "but,
perhaps, if I had placed myself at
the point of view which you have
indicated, I might have done better
by examining the matter."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[670]</a></span></p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Long before the occurrences at
Lourdes, at an epoch when Bernadette
was not yet in the world, in
1843, during the month of April, an
honorable family of Tartas in the
Landes was in a state of great anxiety.
The year before, Mlle. Adèle
de Chariton had been married to M.
Moreau de Sazenay, and now approached
the term of her pregnancy.
The crisis of a first maternity is always
alarming. The medical men,
summoned in haste on the preliminary
symptoms, declared that the
birth would be very difficult, and did
not conceal their fear of some danger.
No one is ignorant of the cruel
anxiety of such a juncture. The
most poignant anguish is not for the
poor wife who is prostrated upon
her bed of pain, and entirely absorbed
in her physical sufferings. It is
the husband whose heart is now the
prey of indescribable tortures. They
are of the age of vivid impressions;
they have entered upon a new life,
and begun to taste the joys of a
union which God seems to have
blessed; they have passed a few
months full of anticipations of the
future. The young couple have set
them down, so to speak, side by side
in a fairy pleasure-boat. The river
of life has carried them softly on
amid banks of flowers. Suddenly,
without warning, the shadow of
death rises before them. The heart
of the husband, expanded with hope
for the child so soon to be born, is
crushed by terror for his wife, who
may be about to perish. He hears
her accents of pain. How will the
crisis end? Is it to be in joy or bereavement?
What is about to issue
from that chamber? Will it be life
or death? What must we send for&mdash;a
cradle or a coffin? Or&mdash;horrible
contrast&mdash;will both be necessary?
Or, worse still, shall two coffins be
necessary? Human science is silent,
and hesitates to pronounce.</p>

<p>This anguish is frightful, but especially
for those who do not seek
from God their strength and consolation.
But M. Moreau was a Christian.
He knew that the thread of
our existence is in the hands of a
supreme Master, to whom we can
always appeal from the doctors of
science. When man has passed sentence,
the King of heaven, as well
as other sovereigns, holds the right
of pardon.</p>

<p>"The Blessed Virgin will, perhaps,
vouchsafe to hear me," thought the
afflicted husband. He addressed
himself with confidence to the Mother
of Christ.</p>

<p>The danger which had appeared
so threatening disappeared as a
cloud upon the horizon. A little
girl had just been born.</p>

<p>Assuredly there was nothing extraordinary
about this deliverance.
However alarming the danger might
have appeared to M. Moreau himself,
the physicians had never given
up hope. The favorable issue of the
crisis may have been something
purely natural.</p>

<p>The heart of the husband and father,
however, felt itself penetrated
with gratitude to the Blessed Virgin.
His was not one of those rebellious
souls which demands freedom from
all doubt in order to escape acknowledging
a favor.</p>

<p>"What name are you going to
give to your little girl?" he was
asked.</p>

<p>"She shall be called Marie."</p>

<p>"Marie? Why, that is the commonest
name in the whole country.
The children of the laboring people,
the servants, are all named Marie.
Besides, Ma<i>r</i>ie Mo<i>r</i>eau is out of all
euphony. The two <i>m</i>'s and two <i>r</i>'s
would be intolerable!" A thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">[671]</a></span>
reasons of equal validity were urged
against him. There was a general
protest.</p>

<p>M. Moreau was very accessible,
and easily moved by others; but in
this instance he resisted all counsel
and entreaty; he braved all discontent,
and his tenacity was really extraordinary.
He did not allow himself
to forget that, in his distress, he
had invoked this sacred name, or
that it belonged to the Queen of
heaven.</p>

<p>"She shall be called Marie, and I
wish her to take the Blessed Virgin
for a patroness. And I tell you the
truth, this name will some day bring
her a blessing."</p>

<p>Everybody was astonished at this
apparent obstinacy, but it remained
unshaken as that of Zachary when
he gave his son the name John.
Vainly did they apply every means
of attack; there was no getting by
this inflexible will. The first-born of
the family, therefore, took the name
of Marie. The father, moreover,
desired that she should be vowed for
three years to dress in white, the
color of the Blessed Virgin. This,
too, was done.</p>

<p>More than sixteen years had now
passed since this episode. A second
daughter had been born, she was
called Marthe. Mlle. Marie Moreau
was being educated at the Convent
of the Sacred Heart at Bordeaux.
About the commencement of January,
1858, she was attacked by a disease
of the eyes, which shortly obliged her
to give up her studies. She supposed
at first that it was only a cold which
would pass off as it had come; but
her hopes were deceived, and her
complaint assumed a most alarming
character. The physician in attendance
judged it necessary to consult
a distinguished oculist of Bordeaux,
M. Bermont. It was not a cold; it
was amaurosis.</p>

<p>"Her case is a very serious one,"
said M. Bermont; "one of the eyes
is entirely gone, and the other in a very
dangerous condition."</p>

<p>The parents were immediately
notified. Her mother hastened to
Bordeaux, and brought back her
daughter, in order that she might
have at home that care, treatment,
and perfect attention which the oculist
had prescribed in order to save
the eye which yet remained, and
which was so gravely affected that it
could perceive objects only as through
a mist.</p>

<p>The medicines, baths, and all the
prescriptions of science proved useless.
Spring and autumn passed
without any change for the better.
Indeed, the deplorable condition of
the invalid was daily aggravated.
Total blindness was approaching.
M. and Madame Moreau decided to
take their child to Paris, in order to
consult the great medical lights.</p>

<p>While engaged in hasty preparations
for their journey, fearing lest it
might be too slow to escape the danger
which threatened their child, the postman
brought them the weekly number
of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messager Catholique</i>. It
was about the first of November, and
this number of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messager Catholique</i>
happened to be precisely the one
which contained the letter of Abbé
Dupont, and the story of the miraculous
cure of Madame Rizan, of Nay,
by means of water from the grotto.</p>

<p>M. Moreau opened it mechanically,
and his glance fell upon that divine
history. He turned pale as he read,
hope began to awaken in the heart
of the desolate father, and that soul,
or rather that heart, was touched by
a gleam of light.</p>

<p>"There," said he&mdash;"there is the
door at which we must knock. It is
evident," he added, with a simplicity
whose actual words we delight to repeat,
"that, if the Blessed Virgin has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[672]</a></span>
really appeared at Lourdes, she must
be interested in working miraculous
cures to prove the truth of her apparitions.
And this is especially true
at first before the event is not generally
believed.... Let us be in a
hurry, then, since in this case the first
come are to be the first served. My
dearest wife and daughter, we must
address ourselves at once to Our
Lady of Lourdes." Sixteen years
had not worn out the faith of M.
Moreau.</p>

<p>A novena was resolved upon, in
which all the neighboring friends of
the young girl were to be asked to
join. By a providential circumstance,
a priest of the city had in his possession
a bottle of the water, so that the
novena could be commenced at once.</p>

<p>The parents, in case of a cure,
bound themselves to make a pilgrimage
to Lourdes, and to devote their
daughter for a year to the colors of
white and blue, the colors of the
Blessed Virgin, which she had already
worn for three years during her infancy.</p>

<p>The novena commenced on Sunday
evening, the 8th of November.</p>

<p>Must it be acknowledged? The
invalid had but little faith. Her
mother dared not hope. Her father
alone had that tranquil faith which
the kind powers of heaven never
resist.</p>

<p>All said the prayers together in
M. Moreau's room, before an image
of the Blessed Virgin. The mother
and her two daughters rose one after
another to retire, but the father remained
on his knees.</p>

<p>He thought he was alone, and his
voice broke forth with a fervor which
recalled his family, who have given
us the account, and who never can
forget that solemn moment without
a tremor.</p>

<p>"Blessed Virgin!" said the father&mdash;"most
blessed Virgin Mary! you
must cure my child. Yes, indeed, you
are <em>bound</em> to do it. It is an obligation
which you cannot refuse to
acknowledge. Remember, O Mary!
how, in spite of everybody and
against everybody, I chose you for
her patron. Remember what struggles
I had to give her your sacred
name. Can you, Holy Virgin, forget
all this? Can you forget how I defended
your glory and power against
the vain reasons with which they surrounded
me? Can you forget that I
publicly placed this child under your
protection, telling everybody and repeating
that your name would some
day bring a blessing upon her? Can
you be unmindful of all this? Are
you not bound in honor&mdash;now that I
am in misfortune, now when I pray
you for our child and yours&mdash;to come
to our help and heal her malady?
Are you going to allow her to become
blind, after the faith I have
shown in you? No! no! impossible!
You will cure her."</p>

<p>Such were the sentiments which
escaped in loud tones from the unhappy
father, as he appealed to the
Blessed Virgin, and, as it were, presenting
a claim against her, demanded
payment.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock at night.</p>

<p>The young girl, before retiring,
dipped a linen bandage in the water
of Lourdes, and, placing it upon her
eyes, tied it behind her head.</p>

<p>Her soul was agitated. Without
having her father's faith, she said to
herself that, after all, the Blessed
Virgin was perfectly able to cure her,
and that, perhaps, at the end of the
novena she might recover her sight.
Then doubt returned, and it seemed
as if a miracle ought not to be worked
for her. With all these thoughts
revolving in her mind, she could
hardly lie still, and it was very late
before she fell asleep.</p>

<p>When morning came, as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[673]</a></span>
she awoke, her first movement of
hope and uneasy curiosity was to
remove the bandage which covered
her eyes. She uttered a loud cry.</p>

<p>The room about her was filled
with the light of the rising day. She
saw clearly, exactly, and distinctly.
The diseased eye had recovered its
health, and the eye which before
was blind had been restored to
sight.</p>

<p>"Marthe! Marthe!" she cried, "I
see perfectly. I am cured!"</p>

<p>Little Marthe, who slept in the
same room, sprang out of bed and
ran to her sister. She saw her eyes,
stripped of their bloody veil, black
and brilliant, and sparkling with life
and strength. The little girl's heart
at once turned toward her father and
mother, who had not yet shared in
this joy.</p>

<p>"Papa! mamma!" she cried.</p>

<p>Marie beckoned her not to call
them yet.</p>

<p>"Wait! wait!" said she, "until I
have tried if I can read. Give me
a book."</p>

<p>The child took one from the table.
"There!" said she.</p>

<p>Marie opened the book, and read
with perfect ease as freely as any
one ever has read. The cure was
complete, radical, absolute, and the
Blessed Virgin had not left her work
half-done.</p>

<p>The father and mother hastened to
the room.</p>

<p>"Papa, mamma, I can see&mdash;I can
read&mdash;I am cured!"</p>

<p>How can we describe the scene
which followed? Our readers can
understand it, each for himself, by
entering into his own imagination.
The door of the house had not yet
been opened. The windows were
closed, and their transparent panes
admitted only the early light of morning.
Who, then, could have entered
to join this family in the happiness
of this sudden blessing? And yet
these Christians felt instinctively that
they were not alone, and that a powerful
being was invisibly in the midst
of them. The father and mother,
and little Marthe, fell on their knees;
Marie, who had not yet arisen, clasped
her hands; and from these four
breasts, oppressed with gratitude and
emotion, went forth, as a prayer of
thanks, the holy name of the Mother
of God: "O holy Virgin Mary! Our
Lady of Lourdes!"</p>

<p>What their other words were, we
know not; but what their sentiments
must have been, any one can imagine
by placing himself before this
miraculous event, which, like a flash
from the power of God, had turned
the affliction of a family into joy and
happiness.</p>

<p>Is it necessary to add that, shortly
afterward, Mlle. Marie Moreau
went with her parents to thank Our
Lady of Lourdes in the place of her
apparition? She left her colored
dresses upon the altar, and went
away happy and proud of wearing
the colors of the Queen of virgins.</p>

<p>M. Moreau, whose faith had formerly
been so strong, was wholly
stupefied. "I thought," said he,
"that such favors were only granted
to the saints; how is it, then, that
they descend upon miserable sinners
like us?"</p>

<p>These facts were witnessed by the
entire population of Tartas, who
shared in the affliction of one of their
most respected families. Everybody
in the city saw and can testify that
the malady, which had been considered
desperate, was completely healed
at the beginning of the novena.
The superior of the Convent of the Sacred
Heart at Bordeaux, the one hundred
and fifty pupils who were school-mates
of Mlle. Marie Moreau, the physicians
of that institution, have established
her serious condition before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[674]</a></span>
events which we have related, and her
total cure immediately afterward. She
returned to Bordeaux, where she remained
two years to complete her
studies.</p>

<p>The oculist Bermont could not
recover from his surprise at an event
so entirely beyond his science. We
have read his declaration certifying
to the state of the invalid, and acknowledging
the inability of medical
treatment to produce such a cure,
"which," he observes, "has persisted
and still holds. As to the instantaneousness
with which this cure has
been wrought," he adds, "it is a fact
which incomparably surpasses the
power of medical science. In testimony
of which I attach my signature.
<span class="smcap">Bermont</span>."</p>

<p>This declaration, dated February
8th, 1859, is preserved at the bishop's
residence at Tarbes, together with a
great number of letters and testimonials
from citizens of Tartas, among
others that of the mayor of that city,
M. Desbord.</p>

<p>Mlle. Marie continued to wear the
colors of the Blessed Virgin up to
the day of her marriage, which took
place after she had finished her studies
and left the Sacred Heart. On
that day she went to Lourdes and
laid aside her maiden attire to put
on her bridal robes. She wished to
give this dress of blue and white to
another young girl, also beloved by
the Blessed Virgin, Bernadette.</p>

<p>This was the only present which
Bernadette ever accepted. She wore
for several years, indeed until it was
worn out, this dress which recalled
the loving power of the divine apparition
at the grotto.</p>

<p>Eleven years have since elapsed.
The favor accorded by the Blessed
Virgin has not been withdrawn. Mlle.
Moreau has always had most excellent
and perfect sight; never any relapse,
never the slightest indisposition.</p>

<p>Excepting by suicide, ingratitude, or
abuse of grace, that which God has
restored can never die. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Resurgens
jam non moritur.</i></p>

<p>Mlle. Marie Moreau is now called
Madame d'Izaru de Villefort, and is
the mother of three delightful children,
who have the finest eyes in the
world. Although they are boys,
each bears in his baptismal name
first the name of Mary.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Miraculous cures were counted
by hundreds. It was impossible to
verify them all. The episcopal commission
submitted thirty of them to
most rigorous scrutiny. The most
severe strictness was shown in this
examination, and nothing was admitted
as supernatural, until it was
absolutely impossible to call it anything
else. All cures which had not
been almost instantaneous, or which
had been occupied by successive
stages, all these were rejected; as
also were all which had been obtained
in conjunction with medical treatment,
however unavailing the latter
might have been. "Although the
inefficacy of the remedies prescribed
by science has been sufficiently demonstrated,
we cannot in this case
in an exclusive manner attribute the
cure to a supernatural virtue in the
water of the grotto which was used
at the same time." So runs the report
of the secretary of the commission.</p>

<p>Moreover, numerous spiritual favors,
singular graces, unlooked-for
conversions, had been reported to the
commission. It is difficult to establish
juridically events which have
taken place in the closed recesses of
the human soul and which escape
the observation of all without. Although
such facts, such changes, are
often more wonderful than the restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[675]</a></span>
of a member or the healing
of a physical disease, the commission
judged rightly when it decided
that it ought not to include them in
the solemn and public inquiry with
which it had been charged by the bishop.</p>

<p>In the report to his grace, the
committee, by agreement with the
physicians, divided the cures which
had been examined into three categories,
with all the carefully gathered
details and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbaux</i>, signed
by the persons cured and by numerous
witnesses.</p>

<p>The first category included those
cures which, despite their striking
and astonishing appearance, were
susceptible of a natural explanation.
These were six in number; namely,
those of Jeanne-Marie Arqué, the
widow Crozat, Blaise Maumus, a
child of the Lasbareilles of Gez,
Jeanne Crassus, Arcizan-Avant, Jeanne
Pomiès of Loubajac.</p>

<p>The second list comprised cures
which the commission felt inclined
to attribute a supernatural character.
Of this number were Jean-Pierre
Malou, Jeanne-Marie Dauber,
wife of a certain Vendôme, Bernarde
Soubies and Pauline Bordeaux of
Lourdes, Jean-Marie Amaré of Beaucens,
Marcelle Peyregue of Agos,
Jeanne-Marie Massot Bordenave of
Arras, Jeanne Gezma and Auguste
Bordes of Pontacq. "The greater
number of these facts," says the medical
report, "possess all the conditions
to cause them be admitted as
supernatural. It will, perhaps, be
found that in excluding them we
have acted with too much reserve
and scrupulousness.</p>

<p>"But far from complaining of this
reproach, we shall congratulate ourselves
upon it, since in these matters
we are convinced that prudence demands
severity."</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, a natural
explanation, although in itself
utterly improbable, seemed rigorously
possible, and this was sufficient to
prevent the examiners from declaring
a miracle.</p>

<p>The third class contained cures
which presented an undeniable and
evident supernatural character, fifteen
in number. Those of: Blaisette
Soupenne, Benoite Cazeaux, Jeanne
Grassus married to Crozat, Louis
Bourriette, little Justin Bouhohorts,
Fabian and Suzanne Baron of Lourdes,
Madame Rizanand, Henry Busquet
of Nay, Catherine Latapie of
Loubajac, Madame Lanou of Bordères,
Marianne Garrot and Denys
Bouchet of Lamarque, Jean-Marie
Tambourné of St. Justin, Mlle. Marie
Moreau de Sazenay of Tartas, Paschaline
Abbadie of Rabasteins, all
these were incontestably miraculous.</p>

<p>"The maladies to which those favored
by such sudden and startling
cures were subject were of entirely
different natures"&mdash;we quote from the
report of the commission. "They possessed
the greatest variety of character.
Some were the subjects of external,
others of internal pathology.
Nevertheless, these various diseases
were all cured by a single simple element,
used either as a lotion or drink,
or sometimes in both ways.</p>

<p>"In the natural and scientific
order, furthermore, each remedy is
used in a fixed and regular manner;
it has its special virtue proper to
a given malady, but is either inefficacious
or hurtful in other cases.</p>

<p>"It is not, then, by any property
inherent in its composition that the
Massabielle water has been able to
produce such numerous, diverse, and
extraordinary cures, and to extinguish
at once diseases of different
and opposite characters. Furthermore,
science has authoritatively declared,
after analysis, that this water
has no mineral or therapeutic qualities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[676]</a></span>
and chemically does not differ
from other pure waters. Medical
science, having been consulted, after
mature and conscientious examination,
is not less decisive in its conclusions."</p>

<p>"In glancing at the general appearance
of these cures," says the
medical report, "one cannot fail to
be struck by the ease, the promptitude,
and instantaneous rapidity with
which they spring from their producing
cause; from the violation
and overthrow of all therapeutic
laws and methods which takes place
in their accomplishment; from the
contradictions offered by them to all
the accepted axioms and cautions of
science; from that kind of disdain
which sports with the chronic nature
and long resistance of the disease;
from the concealed but real care
with which all the circumstances are
arranged and combined: everything,
in short, shows that the cures wrought
belong to an order apart from the
habitual course of nature.</p>

<p>"Such phenomena surpass the
limits of the human intellect. How,
indeed, can it comprehend the opposition
which exists:</p>

<p>"Between the simplicity of the
means and the greatness of the result?</p>

<p>"Between the unity of the remedy
and the variety of the diseases?</p>

<p>"Between the short time employed
in the use of this remedy and the
lengthy treatment indicated by science?</p>

<p>"Between the sudden efficacy of
the former and the long-acknowledged
inutility of the latter?</p>

<p>"Between the chronic nature of
the diseases and the instantaneous
character of the cure?</p>

<p>"There is in all this a contingent
force, superior to any that spring
from natural causes, and, consequently,
foreign to the water of which
it has made use to show forth its
power?"</p>

<p>In view of so many carefully-collected
and publicly-certified facts,
so striking in their nature; in view,
moreover, of the conscientious and
thorough inquiry made by the commission,
together with the formal
and united declarations of medicine
and chemistry, the bishop could no
longer remain unconvinced.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on account of that
spirit of extreme prudence which we
have before remarked, Monseigneur
Laurence, before giving the solemn
episcopal verdict in this matter, demanded
a still further guaranty of
these miraculous cures&mdash;the proof
of time. He allowed three years to
pass. A second examination was
then made. The miraculous cures
still held good. No one appeared
to retract former testimony or to
contest any of the facts. The works
of him who rules over eternity had
nothing to fear from the test of time.</p>

<p>After this overwhelming series of
proofs and certainty, Monseigneur
Laurence at length pronounced the
judgment which all had been awaiting.
We give below its general
features.</p>

<h2>PÈRE JACQUES AND MADEMOISELLE ADRIENNE.<br />

<small>A SKETCH AFTER THE BLOCUS.</small></h2>


<p>It was just five months since I had
left it, the bright, proud Babylon,
beautiful and brave and wicked,
clothed in scarlet and feasting sumptuously.
King Chanticleer, strutting
on the Boulevards, was crowing
loudly, and the myriad tribe of the
Coq Gaulois, strutting up and down
the city, crowed loud and shrill in
responsive chorus&mdash;petits crévés, and
petits mouchards, and petits gamins,
and all that was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit</i> in that grand,
foolish cityful of humanity. Bedlam
was abroad, singing and crowing
and barking itself rabid, and scaring
away from Babylon all that was not
bedlam. But there were many in
Babylon who were not afraid of the
bedlam, who believed that crowing
would by-and-by translate itself into
action, into those seeds of desperate
daring that none but madmen can
accomplish, and that, when the bugle
sounded, these bragging, swaggering
maniacs would shoulder the musket,
and, rushing to the fore, save France
or die for her. No one saved her,
but many did rush to the fore, and
die for her. They were not lunatics,
though, at least not many of them.
The lunatics showed, as they have
often done before, that there was
method in their madness. They
cheered on the sane, phlegmatic
brethren to death and glory, while
they stayed prudently at home to
keep up the spirits of the capital;
they were the spirit and soul of the
defence, the others were but the bone
and muscle of it. What is a body
without a soul? The frail arm of the
flesh without the nerve and strength
of the spirit? Pshaw! If it were
not for the crowing of King Chanticleer,
there would have been no siege
at all; the whole concern would have
collapsed in its cradle.</p>

<p>The story of that Blocus has yet
to be written. Of its outward and
visible story, many volumes, and
scores of volumes, good and bad,
true and false, have been already
written. But the inward story, the
arcana of the defence, the exposition
of that huge, blundering machine
that, with its springs and levers, and
wheels within wheels, snapped and
broke and collapsed in the driver's
hand, all this is still untold. The
great <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pourquoi?</i> is still unanswered.
History will solve the riddle some
day, no doubt, as it solves most
riddles, but before that time comes,
other, grander problems of greater
import to us will have been solved
too, and we shall care but little for
the true story of the Blocus.</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur," said my concierge,
when we met and talked over the
events that had passed since the first
of September, when I fled and left my
goods and chattels to her care and
the tender mercies of the Prussians
and the Reds&mdash;"yes, monsieur, it is
very wonderful that one doesn't hear
of anybody having died of cold,
though the winter was so terrible,
and the fuel so scarce. It ran short
almost from the beginning. We had
nothing but green sticks that couldn't
be persuaded to burn and do our
best. I used to sit shivering in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[678]</a></span>
bed, while the petiots tried to warm
themselves skipping in the porte-cochère,
or running up and down
from the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cintième</i> till their little legs
were dead beat. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">O Mon Dieu! je
me rapellerai de cette guerre en tous
les sens, monsieur.</span>"</p>

<p>"Did many die from starvation," I
asked&mdash;"many in this neighborhood
that you knew?"</p>

<p>"Not one, monsieur! Not one of
actual hunger, though my belief is,
plenty of folks died of poison. The
bread we ate was worse than the want
of it. Such an abomination, made out
of hay and bran and oats; why, monsieur,
a chiffonier's dog wouldn't have
touched it in Christian times. How it
kept body and soul together for any
of us is more than I can understand."</p>

<p>"And yet nobody died of want?"
I repeated.</p>

<p>"Not that I heard of, monsieur;
unless you count Père Jacques as
dead from starvation. He disappeared
one morning soon after he
told Mlle. Adrienne, and nobody
ever knew what became of him.
They said in the quartier that he
went over to the Prussians; but
they said that of better men than
Père Jacques, and besides, what
would the Prussians do with a poor
old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">toqué</i> like Père Jacques, I ask
it of monsieur?"</p>

<p>I was going to say that I fully
agreed with her, when we were both
startled by a sudden uproar in the
street round the corner. We rushed
out simultaneously from the porte-cochère,
where we were holding our
confabulation, to see what was the
matter. A crowd was collected in
the middle of the Rue Billault, and
was vociferously cheering somebody
or something. As a matter of course,
the assembly being French, there
were counter-cheers; hisses and cries
of "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">renégat! Vendu aux Prussiens!
drôle</span>," etc., intermingling with more
friendly exclamations.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon Dieu! ce n'est done pas
fini!</span> Is the war going to begin
again? Are we going to have a revolution?"
demanded my concierge,
throwing up her hands to heaven
and then wringing them in despair.
"Will the petiots never be able to eat
their panade and build their little
mud-pies in peace! Oh! monsieur,
monsieur, you are happy not to be a
Frenchman!"</p>

<p>Without in the least degree demurring
to this last proposition, I suggested
that before giving up France as
an utterly hopeless case, we would
do well to see what the row was
about; if indeed it were a row, for
the cheering, as the crowd grew,
seemed to rise predominant above
the hissing. Already reassured, I advanced
boldly toward the centre of
disturbance, my concierge following,
and keeping a tight grip of the skirts
of my coat for greater security.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive Mlle. Adrienne! Donne la
patte Mlle. Adrienne! Vive le Père
Jacques!</span>" The cries, capped by
peals of laughter which were suddenly
drowned in the uproarious
braying of a donkey, reverberated
through the street and deafened us
as we drew near.</p>

<p>With a shout of laughter, my concierge
dropped my skirts, and clapping
her hands:</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment!</span>" she cried, "she is
alive, then! He did not eat her!
He did not sell her! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive le Père
Jacques! Vive Mlle. Adrienne!</span>"</p>

<p>Those of my readers who have
lived any time in the quartier of the
Champs Elysées will recognize Mlle.
Adrienne as an old friend, and rejoice
to learn that, thanks to the intelligent
devotion of Père Jacques,
she did not share the fate of her asinine
sisterhood, but has actually gone
through the horrors of the siege of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[679]</a></span>
Paris and lived to tell the tale. Those
who have not the pleasure of her acquaintance
will perhaps be glad to
make it, and to hear something of so
remarkable a personage.</p>

<p>For years&mdash;I am afraid to say how
many, but ten is certainly within the
mark&mdash;Père Jacques's donkey has
been a familiar object in the Rue
Billault and the Rue de Berri, and
that part of the Faubourg St. Honoré
and the Champs Elysées which
includes those streets. Why Père
Jacques christened his ass Mlle. Adrienne
nobody knows. Some say, out
of vengeance against a certain blue-eyed
Adrienne who won his heart and
broke it; others say, only love for a
faithful Adrienne who broke his
heart by dying; but this is pure
conjecture; Père Jacques himself is
reticent on the subject, and, when
questioned once by a curious, impertinent
man, he refused to explain
himself further than by remarking,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que chacun avait son idée, et que
son idée à lui, c'etait Mlle. Adrienne</span>,"
and having said this he took
a lump of sugar from his pocket and
presented it affectionately to his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée</i>,
who munched it with evident satisfaction,
and acknowledged her sense
of the attention by a long and uproarious
bray.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyons, Mlle. Adrienne! Calmons-nous!</span>"
said Père Jacques in a
tone of persuasive authority. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Calmons-nous,
ma chérie!</span>"&mdash;the braying
grew louder and louder&mdash;"wilt thou
be silent? <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Uplà, Mlle. Adrienne! Ah,
les femmes, les femmes! Toujours bavardes!
La-a-a-à, Mlle. Adrienne!</span>"</p>

<p>This was the usual style of conversation
between the two. Père Jacques
presented lumps of sugar which were
invariably recognized by a bray, or,
more properly, a series of brays, such
as no other donkey in France or Navarre
but herself could send forth;
and while it lasted Père Jacques kept
up a running commentary of remonstrance.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyons, Mlle. Adrienne! Sapristi,
veux-tu te taire? A-t-on jamais
vu! Lotte, veux-tu en fini-i-i-r!</span>"</p>

<p>Though it was an old novelty in
the quartier, it seemed never to have
lost its savor, and as soon as Père
Jacques and his little cart, full of
apples, or oranges, or cauliflowers,
as the case might be, were seen or
heard at the further end of the street,
the gamins left off marbles and pitch-and-toss
to bully and chaff Père
Jacques and greet his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée</i> with a
jocular "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonjour, Mlle. Adrienne.</span>"
The tradesmen looked up from their
weights and measures, laughing, as
the pair went by.</p>

<p>When provisions began to run short
during the Blocus, Père Jacques grew
uneasy, not for himself, but for Mlle.
Adrienne. Hard-hearted jesters advised
him to fatten her up for the
market; ass-flesh was delicate and
rarer than horse-flesh, and fetched
six francs a pound; it was no small
matter to turn six francs in these
famine times, when there were no
more apples or cauliflowers to sell;
Mlle. Adrienne was a burden now
instead of a help to her master; the
little cart stood idle in the corner;
there was nothing to trundle, and it
was breaking his heart to see her
growing thin for want of rations, and
to watch her spirits drooping for want
of exercise and lumps of sugar. For
more than a fortnight Père Jacques
deprived himself of a morsel of the
favorite dainty, and doled out his last
demikilog to her with miserly economy,
hoping always that the gates
would be opened before she came to
the last lump.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyons, ma fille!</span>" Père Jacques
would say, as she munched a bit half
the usual size of the now precious
bonbon. "Cheer up, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma bouriquette</span>!
Be reasonable, Mlle. Adrienne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">[680]</a></span>
be reasonable, and bear thy
trials like an ass, patiently and bravely,
not like a man, grumbling and
despairing. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Paperlotte, Mlle. Adrienne</span>!
if it were not for thee I should
be out on the ramparts, and send
those coquins to the right-abouts myself.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les gredins!</span> they are not content
with drilling our soldiers and
starving our citizens, but they must
rob thee of thy bit of sugar, my pretty
one. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mille tonnerres</span>! if I had but
their necks under my arm for one
squeeze!"</p>

<p>And, entering into the grief and
indignation of her master, Mlle. Adrienne
would set up an agonized bray.</p>

<p>Thus comforting one another, the
pair bore up through their trials. But
at last came the days of eating mice
and rats, and bread that a dog in
good circumstances would have turned
up its nose at a month ago, and
then Père Jacques shook in his sabots.
He dared not show himself abroad
with Mlle. Adrienne, and not only
that, but he lived in chronic terror
of a raid being made on her at home.
The mischievous urchins who had
amused themselves at the expense of
his paternal feelings in days of comparative
plenty, gave him no peace
or rest now that the wolf was really
at the door. Requisitions were being
made in private houses to see
that no stores were hoarded up while
the people outside were famishing.
One rich family, who had prudently
bought a couple of cows at the beginning
of the Blocus, after vainly
endeavoring to keep the fact a secret,
and surrounding the precious beasts
with as much mystery and care as
ever Egyptian worshippers bestowed
on the sacred Isis, were forced to
give them up to the commonwealth.
This caused a great sensation in the
quartier. Père Jacques was the first
to hear it, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gamins</i> improved
the opportunity by declaring to him
that the republic had issued a decree
that all asses were to be seized next
day, all such as could not speak,
they added facetiously, and there was
to be a general slaughter of them, a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">massacre des innocents</i>, the little brutes
called it, at the abattoir of the Rue
Valois. The fact of its being at the
Rue Valois was a small mercy for
which they reminded Père Jacques
to be duly grateful, inasmuch as, it
being close at hand, he might accompany
Mlle. Adrienne to the place of
execution, give her a parting kiss,
and hear her last bray of adieu. At
this cynical climax, Père Jacques
started up in a rage, and seizing his
stick, set to vigorously belaboring the
diabolical young torturers, who took
to their heels, yelling and screaming
like frightened guinea-pigs, while
Mlle. Adrienne, who stood ruminating
in a corner of the room, opened
a rattling volley of brays on the fugitives.</p>

<p>All that night Père Jacques lay
awake in terror. Every whistle of
the wind, every creak in the door,
every stir and sound, set his heart
thumping violently against his ribs;
every moment he was expecting the
dreaded domiciliary visit. What was
he to do? Where was he to fly?
How was he to cheat the brigands
and save Mlle. Adrienne? The
night wore out, and the dawn broke,
and the raid was still unaccomplished.
As soon as it was light, Père
Jacques rose and dressed himself,
and sat down on a wooden stool
close by Mlle. Adrienne, and pondered.
Since her life had been in
jeopardy, he had removed her from
her out-house in the court to his
own private room on the ground-floor
close by.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Que me conseilles-tu, Mlle. Adrienne?</span>"
murmured the distracted
parent, speaking in a low tone, impelled
by the instinct that drives human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">[681]</a></span>
beings to seek sympathy somewhere,
from a cat or a dog if they
have no fellow-creature to appeal to,
Père Jacques had contracted a habit
of talking out loud to his dumb companion
when they were alone, and
consulting her on any perplexing
point. Suddenly a bright idea struck
Père Jacques; he would go and consult
Mère Richard.</p>

<p>Mère Richard lived in a neighboring
court amidst a numerous family
of birds of many species, bullfinches,
canaries, and linnets. She had often
suggested to Père Jacques to adopt
a little songster by way of cheering
his lonely den, and had once offered
him a young German canary of her
own bringing up.</p>

<p>"It's as good as a baby for tricks
and company, and nothing so dear
to keep," urged Mère Richard.</p>

<p>But Père Jacques had gratefully declined.
"Mlle. Adrienne is company
enough for me," he said, "and it
might hurt her feelings if I took up
with a bird now, thanks to you all
the same, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">voisine</span>."</p>

<p>To-day, as he neared the house,
he looked in vain for the red and
green cages that used to hang out <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au
troisième</span> on either side of Mère Richard's
windows. The birds were
gone. Where? Père Jacques felt a
sympathetic thrill of horror, and
with a heavy heart mounted the dark
little stairs, no longer merry with the
sound of chirping from the tidy little
room <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au troisième</span>. He refrained,
through delicate consideration for
Mère Richard's feelings, from asking
questions, but, casting his eyes
round the room, he beheld the
empty cages ranged in a row behind
the door.</p>

<p>But Mère Richard had a donkey.
There was no comparison to be tolerated
for a moment between it and
Mlle. Adrienne, still their positions
were identical, and Mère Richard,
who was a wise woman, would help
him in his present difficulty, and if
she could not help him she would,
at any rate, sympathize with him,
which was the next best thing to
helping him. But Mère Richard, to
his surprise, had heard nothing of
the impending raid on donkeys.
When he explained to her how the
case stood, instead of breaking out
into lamentations, she burst into a
chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pas possible!</span> Bouriquette good
to be eaten, and the republic going
to buy her, and pay me six
francs a pound for her! Père Jaques,
it's too good to be true," declared
the unnatural old Harpagon.</p>

<p>Père Jacques was unable to contain
his indignation. He vowed that rather
than let her fall into the hands
of the cannibals, he would destroy
Mlle. Adrienne with his own hand;
he would kill any man in the republic,
from Favre to Gambetta, who
dared to lay a finger on her; aye,
that he would, if he were to swing
for it the next hour!</p>

<p>"Père Jacques, you are an imbecile,"
observed Mère Richard, taking
a pinch of snuff; "you remind me of
a story my bonhomme used to tell
of two camarades of his that he met
on their way to be hanged; one of
them didn't mind it, and walked on
quietly, holding his tongue; but the
other didn't like it at all, and kept
howling and whining, and making a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tapage de diable</span>. At last the quiet
one lost patience, and turning round
on the other, '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eh grand bétat</span>,' he
cried, '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si tu n'en veux pas, n'en dégoute
pas les autres</span>!'"</p>

<p>Père Jaques saw the point of the
story, and, taking the hint, stood up
to go.</p>

<p>"What did you do with the birds?"
he demanded sternly, as he was
leaving the room.</p>

<p>"Sold four of them for three francs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">[682]</a></span>
apiece, and ate three of them, and
uncommonly good they were," said
the wretched woman, with unblushing
heartlessness.</p>

<p>"Monster!" groaned Père Jacques,
and hurried from her presence.</p>

<p>All that day he and Mlle. Adrienne
stayed at home with their door and
window barred and bolted; but
night came, and the domiciliary visit
was still a threat. Next day, however,
the little door stood open as
usual, and Père Jacques was to be
seen hammering away at the dilapidated
legs of a table that he was
mending for a neighbor at the rate of
twenty-five centimes a leg; but Mlle.
Adrienne was not there. Had Père
Jacques put an end to his agony by
actually killing her, as he had threatened,
and so saved her from the ignoble
fate of the shambles? Or
had he, haunted by the phantom of
hunger which was now staring at him
with its pale spectral eyes from the
near background, yielded to the old
man's love of life, and sold his friend
to prolong it and escape himself from
a ghastly death? Most people believed
the latter alternative, but
nobody knew for certain. When Mlle.
Adrienne's name was mentioned,
Père Jacques would frown, and give
unmistakable signs of displeasure.
If the subject was pressed, he would
seize his stick, and, making a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moulinet</i>
over his head with it, prepare an expletive
that the boldest never waited
to receive. One day he was caught
crying bitterly in his now solitary
home, and muttering to himself between
the sobs, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ma pauvre fille!
Mlle. Adrienne! Je le suivrai bientôt&mdash;ah
les coquins, les brigands, les
monstres!</span>" This was looked upon
as conclusive. The monsters in
question could only be the Shylocks
of the abattoir who had tempted him
with blood-money for Mlle. Adrienne.
When curiosity was thus far satisfied,
the gamins ceased to worry Père
Jacques; the lonely old man became
an object of pity to everybody, even
to the gamins themselves; when they
met him now they touched their caps,
with "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonjour, Père Jacques!</span>" and
spared him the cruel jeer that had
been their customary salutation of
late: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mlle. Adrienne à la casserole!
Bon appétit, Père Jacques!</span>"</p>

<p>The days wore on, and the weeks,
and the months. Paris, wan and
pale and hunger-stricken, still held
out. Winter had come, and thrown
its icy pall upon the city, hiding her
guilty front "under innocent snow;"
the nights were long and cold, the dawn
was desolate, the tepid noon brought
no warmth to the perishing, fire-bound
multitude. No sign of succor came
to them from without. In vain they
watched and waited, persecuting time
with hope. The cannon kept up its
sobbing recitative through the black
silence of the night; through the
white stillness of the day. Hunger
gnawed into their vitals, till even
hope, weary with disappointment,
grew sick and died.</p>

<p>One morning, the neighbors noticed
Père Jacques's door and window
closed long after the hour when he
was wont to be up and busy. They
knocked, and, getting no answer,
turned the handle of the door; it
was neither locked nor barred, merely
closed, as if the master were within;
but he was not; the little room was
tenantless, and almost entirely stripped;
the mattress and the scanty
store of bed-clothes were gone; the
iron bedstead, a table, a stool, and
two cane chairs, were the only sticks
of furniture that remained; the
shelves were bare of the bright pewter
tankards and platters that used to
adorn them; the gilt clock with its
abortion of a Pegasus bestrid by a
grenadier, which had been the glory
of the chimney-piece, had disappeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[683]</a></span>
What did it all mean? Had the
enemy made a raid on Père Jacques
and his property during the night,
and carried away the lot in a balloon?
Great was the consternation, and
greater still the gossip of the little
community, when the mysterious
event became known through the
quartier. What had become of Père
Jacques? Had he been kidnapped,
or had he been murdered, or had he
taken flight of his own accord, and
whither, and why? Nothing transpired
to throw any light on the
mystery, and the gossips, tired of
guessing, soon ceased to think about
it, and, like many another nine days'
wonder, Père Jacques's disappearance
died a natural death.</p>

<p>A day came at last when the mitrailleuse
hushed its hideous shriek,
the cannon left off booming, the wild
beasts of war were silent. Paris cried,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci!</span>" and the gates were opened.
The city, like a sick man healed of a
palsy, rose up, and shook herself and
rubbed her eyes, and ate plentifully
after her long fast. Many came back
from the outposts who were wept
over as dead. There were strange
meetings in many quartiers during
those first days that followed the
capitulation. But no one brought
any news of Père Jacques. There
were too many interests nearer and
dearer to think of, and, in the universal
excitement of shame and vengeance
and rare flashes of joy, he and
Mlle. Adrienne were forgotten as if
they had never been. But when, on
the day of my return to Paris, my
conversation with my concierge was
interrupted by the cheering of the
crowd in the Rue Billault, and when
the cause of the hubbub was made
known, the fact that both Père
Jacques and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée</i> were well remembered
and, as the newspapers
put it, universally esteemed by a
large circle of friends and admirers,
was most emphatically attested. Nothing,
indeed, could be more gratifying
than the manner in which their
resurrection was received. The pair
looked very much the worse for their
sojourn in the other world, wherever
it was, to which they had emigrated.
Mlle. Adrienne's appearance was particularly
affecting. She was worn to
skin and bone; and certainly, if
Père Jacques, yielding to the pangs
of hunger, had sacrificed his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">idée</i> to
his life, and taken her to the shambles,
she would not have fetched
more than a brace of good rats, or,
at best, some ten francs, from the inhuman
butchers of the Rue Valois.
She dragged her legs, and shook and
stumbled as if the weight of her attenuated
person were too much for them.
Even her old enemies, the gamins,
were moved to pity, while Père
Jacques, laughing and crying and
apostrophizing Mlle. Adrienne in his
old familiar way, cheered her on to
their old home. How she ever got
there is as great a marvel as how she
lived to be led there to-day; for,
what between physical exhaustion
and mental anxiety&mdash;for the crowd
kept overpowering her with questions
and caresses&mdash;and what between the
well-meant but injudicious attentions
of sundry little boys who kept stuffing
unintermitting bits of straw and
lumps of sugar into her mouth, it is
little short of a miracle that she did
not choke and expire on the macadam
of the Rue Billault.</p>

<p>Many an ass has been lionized before,
and many a one will be so again.
It is a common enough sight in these
days, but never did hero or heroine
of the tribe bear herself more becomingly
on the trying occasion than
Mlle. Adrienne. As to Père Jacques,
he bore himself as well as he could,
trying hard to look dignified and unconscious,
while in his inmost heart
he was bursting with pride. While<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[684]</a></span>
he and Mlle. Adrienne ambled on
side by side, some facetious person
remarked that Père Jacques looked
quite beside himself. This, indeed,
was a great day for him and his ass.
Yet, notwithstanding that his heart
was moved within him and softened
towards all men&mdash;nay, towards all
boys&mdash;he could not be induced to say
a word as to where he had been, or
what he had done, or how he and
Mlle. Adrienne had fared in the wilderness,
or what manner of wilderness
it was, or anything that could
furnish the remotest clue to their existence
since the day when they had
separately disappeared off the horizon
of the Rue Billault. Provisions were
still too dear, during the first fortnight
after the capitulation, to allow
of Père Jacques resuming his old
trade of apples or cauliflowers; besides,
Mademoiselle Adrienne wanted
rest.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pauvre chérie! il faut qu'elle se
remette un peu de la vache enragée</span>,"
he remarked tenderly, when his friends
condoled with him on her forced inactivity.
He would not hear of hiring
her out for work, as some of them
proposed. Mère Richard came and
offered a fabulous price for the loan
of her for three days, with a view to
a stroke of business at the railway
station, where food was pouring in
from London. Père Jacques shook
his fist at the carnivorous old woman,
and warned her never to show her
unnatural old face in his house again,
or it might be worse for her.</p>

<h2>THE SECULAR NOT SUPREME.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></h2>


<p>Dr. Bellows is the well-known pastor
of All Souls' Church, and editor
of the <cite>Liberal Christian</cite> in this city,
a distinguished Unitarian minister,
with some religious instincts and respectable
literary pretensions. As a
student in college and the Divinity
School, Cambridge, Massachusetts, he
was full of promise, and a great favorite
of the late Hon. Edward Everett,
himself originally a Unitarian
minister and pastor of Brattle Street
Church, Boston. The Hon. E. P.
Hurlbut was formerly one of the
judges of the Supreme Court of this
state, a lawyer by profession, with a
passably clear head and a logical
mind, who knows, if not the truth, at
least what he means, and neither
fears nor hesitates to say it. His
pamphlet, as far as it goes, expresses,
we doubt not, his honest
thought, but his thought is the
thought of a secularist, who admits
no order above the secular, and holds
that no religion not subordinate to and
under the control of the civil power,
should be tolerated. Both he and Dr.
Bellows are from instinct and education
hearty haters of the Catholic
Church; but while he is content to
war against her from the point of
view of pure secularism or no-religion,
that is, atheism, the reverend doctor
seeks to clothe his hatred in a
Christian garb and to war against
Christ in the name of Christ.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellows, as a Liberal Christian,
and though a Protestant hardly
allowed by his more rigid Protestant
countrymen to bear the Christian
name, has a double battle to
fight: one, against the Evangelical
movement, at the head of which is
Mr. Justice Strong, of the Supreme
Court, to amend the constitution of
the United States so as to make orthodox
Protestantism the official religion
of the republic, which would
exclude him and his Unitarian, Universalist,
and Quaker brethren; and
the other, against the admission of the
equal rights of Catholics with Protestants
before the American state.
Catholics greatly trouble him, and
he hardly knows what to do with
them. According to the letter of
the constitution of the Union and of
the several states, unless New Hampshire
be an exception, they are American
citizens, standing in all respects
on a footing of perfect equality with
any other class of citizens, and have
as much right to take part in public
affairs, and to seek to manage them
in the interests of their religion, as
Protestants have to take part in them
in the interests of Protestantism; but
this is very wrong, and against the
spirit of the constitution; for the nation
is a Protestant nation, the country
was originally settled by and belongs
to Protestantism, and Catholics
ought to understand that they
are really here only by sufferance,
that they do not in reality stand in
relation to public questions on a footing
of equality with Protestants, and
have really no right to exert any influence
in regard to the public policy
of the country not in accordance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[686]</a></span>
the convictions of the Protestant majority.
He tells us, in the discourse
before us and more distinctly still in
the columns of the <cite>Liberal Christian</cite>,
not to aspire as citizens to equality
with Protestants as if we had as much
right to the government as they
have, and warns us that if we do we
shall be resisted even unto blood.</p>

<p>The occasion of his outpouring of
wrath against Catholics is that they
have protested against being taxed for
the support of a system of sectarian
or godless schools, to which they are
forbidden in conscience to send their
children, and have demanded as their
right either that the tax be remitted,
or that their proportion of the public
schools be set off to them, to be, as
to education and discipline, under
Catholic control. Dr. Bellows allows
that the Catholic demand is just, and
that by making it a question at the
polls they may finally obtain it; but
this is not to his mind, for it would
defeat the pet scheme of Protestants
for preventing the growth of Catholicity
in the country, by detaching,
through the influence of the public
schools, their children from the faith
of their parents. Yet as long as any
religion, even the reading of the Bible,
is insisted on in the public schools,
what solid argument can be urged
against the demand of Catholics, or
what is to prevent Catholic citizens
from making it a political question
and withholding their votes from the
party that refuses to respect their
rights of conscience and to do them
justice? Dr. Bellows says that we
cannot legally be prevented from doing
so, but, if we do so, it will be the
worse for us; for if we carry our religion
to the polls the Protestant people
will, as they should, rise up against
us and overwhelm us by their immense
majority, perhaps even exterminate
us.</p>

<p>To prevent the possibility of collision,
the reverend doctor proposes
a complete divorce of church and
state. He proposes to defeat the
Evangelicals on the one hand, and
the Catholics on the other, by separating
totally religion and politics.
Thus he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is the vast importance of keeping the
political and the religious movements and
action of the people apart, and in their
own independent spheres, that makes
wise citizens, alike on religious and on
civil grounds, look with alarm and jealousy
on any endeavors, on the part either
of Protestants or Catholics, to secure
any special attention or support, any partial
or separate legislation or subsidies,
from either the national or the state governments.
I have already told you that
Protestants, representing the great sects
in this country, are now laboring, by
movable conventions, to mould public
opinion in a way to give finally a theological
character to the constitution. In a
much more pardonable spirit, because in
accordance with their historical antecedents,
their hereditary temper, and their
ecclesiastical logic, the Roman Catholics
in this country are, in many states, and
every great city of the Union, using the
tremendous power they possess as the
make-weight of parties, to turn the public
treasure in a strong current into their
own channels, and thus secure an illegitimate
support as a religious body. It is
not too much to guess that more than
half of the ecclesiastical wealth of the
Roman Catholic Church in America,
against the wishes and convictions of a
Protestant country, has been voted to it
in lands and grants by municipalities and
legislatures trading for Irish votes. The
Catholic Church thus has a factitious
prosperity and progress. It is largely
sustained by Protestants&mdash;not on grounds
of charity and toleration, or from a sense
of its usefulness (that were well privately
done), but from low and unworthy political
motives in both the great parties
of the country. Now that Roman Catholics
themselves should take advantage
of their solidarity as a people
and a church, and of the power of
their priesthood, with all uninformed
and some enlightened communicants, to
turn the political will into a machine for
grinding their ecclesiastical grist, is not
unnatural, nor wholly unpardonable. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">[687]</a></span>
it is fearfully dangerous to them and to
us. Their success&mdash;due to the sense of
the Protestant strength which thinks it
can afford to blink their machinations, or
to the preoccupation of the public mind
with the emulative business pursuits of
the time, or to the confidence which the
American people seem to feel in the final
and secure divorce of church and state&mdash;their
unchecked success encourages them
to bolder and more bold demands, and
accustoms the people to more careless
and more perilous acquiescence in their
claims. The principle of authority in religion,
which has so many temperamental
adherents in all countries; the inherent
love of pomp and show in worship, strongest
in the least educated; a natural weariness
of sectarian divisions, commonest
among lazy thinkers and stupid consciences&mdash;all
these play into the hands of the
Romanists, and they are making hay
while the sun shines.</p>

<p>"There are no reviews, no newspapers
in this country, so bold and unqualified;
none so unscrupulous and so intensely
zealous and partisan; none so fearless
and outspoken as the Catholic journals.
They profess to despise Protestant opposition;
they deride the feeble tactics of
other Christian sects; they are more ultramontane,
more Roman, more Papal,
than French, German, Austrian, Bavarian,
Italian believers; they avow their purpose
to make this a Roman Catholic
country, and they hope to live on the
Protestant enemy while they are converting
him. They often put their religious
faith above their political obligation, and,
as bishops and priests, make it a duty to
the church for their members to vote as
Catholics rather than as American citizens.
Not what favors the peace, prosperity,
and union of the nation, but what
favors their church, is the supreme question
for them at every election; and American
politicians, for their predatory purposes,
have taught them this, and are
their leaders in it.</p>

<p>"Now, as an American citizen, I say
nothing against the equality of the rights
of the Roman Catholics and the Protestants;
both may lawfully strive, in their
unpolitical spheres, for the mastery, and
the law may not favor or disfavor either;
nor can anything be done to prevent Roman
Catholics from using their votes as
Roman Catholics, if they please. It is
against the spirit, but not against the letter
of the constitution. At any rate, it
cannot be helped; only, it may compel
Protestants to form parties and vote as
Protestants against Roman Catholic interests,
which would be a deplorable necessity,
and lead, sooner or later, through
religious parties in politics, to religious
wars. The way to avoid such a horrible
possibility&mdash;alas, such a threatening probability
for the next generation&mdash;is at
once to look with the utmost carefulness
and the utmost disfavor upon every effort
on the part of either Protestants or
Catholics to mix up sectarian or theological
or religious questions with national
and state and city politics.</p>

<p>"Every appeal of a sect, a denominational
church, or sectarian charity of any
description, to the general government,
or state or city governments, for subsidies
or favors, should be at once discountenanced
and forbidden by public opinion,
and made impossible by positive statute.
The Protestant sects in this country
should hasten to remove from their record
any advantages whatsoever guaranteed
to them by civil law to any partiality
or sectarian distinction. The most important
privilege they enjoy by law in
most of the states is the right of keeping
the Bible in the public schools. It is a
privilege associated with the tenderest
and most sacred symbol of the Protestant
faith&mdash;the Bible. To exclude it from the
public schools is to the religious affections
of Protestants like Abraham's sacrifice
of his only son. When it was first
proposed, I felt horror-stricken, and instinctively
opposed it; but I have thought
long and anxiously upon the subject, and
have, from pure logical necessity and
consistency, been obliged to change&mdash;nay,
reverse my opinion. Duty to the
unsectarian character of our civil institutions
demands that this exclusion should
be made. It will not be any disclaimer
of the importance of the Bible in the education
of American youth, but only a
concession that we cannot carry on the
religious with the secular education of
American children, at the public expense
and in the public schools. So long as
Protestant Christians insist, merely in
the strength of their great majority, upon
maintaining the Bible in the public
schools, they justify Roman Catholics in
demanding that the public money for education
shall be distributed to sects in
proportion to the number of children
they educate. This goes far to break up
the common-school system of this country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[688]</a></span>
and, if carried out, must ultimately tend
to dissolve the Union, which morally depends
upon the community of feeling
and the homogeneity of culture produced
by an unsectarian system of common
schools."&mdash;<cite>Church and State</cite>, pp. 16-19.</p></blockquote>

<p>But this proposed remedy will
prove worse than the disease. The
state divorced from the church, wholly
separated from religion, is separated
from morality; and the state separated
from morality, that is, from the
moral order, from natural justice inseparable
from religion, cannot stand,
and ought not to stand, for it is incapable
of performing a single one
of its proper functions. The church,
representing the spiritual, and therefore
the superior, order, is by its own
nature and constitution as independent
of the state as the soul is of the
body; and the state separated from
the church, or from religion and morality,
is like the body separated from
the soul, dead, a putrid or putrefying
corpse. Exclude your Protestant Bible
and all direct and indirect religious
instruction from your public
schools, and you would not render
them a whit less objectionable to us
than they are now, for we object not
less to purely secular schools than
we do to sectarian schools. We hold
that children should be trained up in
the way they should go, so that when
old they will not depart from it; and
the way in which they should go is
not the way of pure secularism, but
the way enjoined by God our Maker
through his church. God has in this
life joined soul and body, the spiritual
and the secular, together, and what
God has joined together we dare
not put asunder. There is only one
of two things that can satisfy us:
either cease to tax us for the support
of the public schools, and leave the
education of our children to us, or
give us our proportion of the public
schools in which to educate them
in our own religion. We protest
against the gross injustice of being
taxed to educate the children of non-Catholics,
and being obliged in addition
to support schools for our own
children at our own expense, or peril
their souls.</p>

<p>We do not think Dr. Bellows
is aware of what he demands when
he demands the complete divorce of
church and state, or the total separation
of religion and politics. The
state divorced from the church is a
godless state, and politics totally separated
from religion is simply political
atheism, and political atheism
is simply power without justice,
force without law; for there is no
law without God, the supreme and
universal Lawgiver. Man has no original
and underived legislative power,
and one man has in and of himself
no authority over another; for
all men by the law of nature are
equal, and have equal rights, and
among equals no one has the right
to govern. All governments based
on political atheism, or the assumption
that politics are independent of
religion, rest on no foundation, are
usurpations, tyrannies, without right,
and can govern, if at all, only by
might or sheer force. To declare
the government divorced from religion
is to declare it emancipated
from the law of God, from all moral
obligation, and free to do whatever
it pleases. It has no duties, and under
it there are and can be no rights;
for rights and duties are in the moral
order and inseparable from religion,
since the law of God is the basis of
all rights and duties, the foundation
and guarantee of all morality. The
state, divorced from religion, would
be bound to recognize and protect
no rights of God or man, not even
those natural and inalienable rights
of all men, "life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness." This is going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[689]</a></span>
further in the direction of absolutism
than go the doctor's dear friends the
Turks, whom he so warmly eulogizes
in his letters from the East, for even
they hold the sultan is bound by the
Koran, and forbidden to do anything
it prohibits.</p>

<p>Dr. Bellows, doubtless, has no intention
of divorcing the state from
morality, and does not see that his
proposition implies it. He probably
holds that morality is separable from
religion, for with him religion is simply
sentiment or opinion; but in this
he falls into the common mistake of
all Liberal Christians, and of many
Protestants who regard Liberal Christians
as no Christians at all. Morality
and religion are inseparable, for
morality is only the practical application
in the several departments of life
of the principles of religion. Without
religion morality has no foundation,
nothing on which to rest, is a baseless
fabric, an unreality. Deny God, and
you deny the moral law and the whole
moral order, all right, all duty, all human
accountability. The separation of
all political questions from all religious
questions, which the reverend doctor
demands, is their separation from
all moral questions, and is the emancipation
of the state from all right
and all duty, or the assertion of its
unrestricted power to do whatever
it pleases, in total disregard of all
moral and religious considerations.
Is this the doctrine of a Christian?</p>

<p>This surely is not the relation of
church and state in America, and
derives no support from the American
order of thought. With us, the
state is instituted chiefly for the protection
of the natural rights of man, as
we call them, but really the rights
of God, since they are anterior to
civil society, are superior to it, and
not derived or derivable from it.
These rights it is the duty of civil society
to protect and defend. Any
acts of the political sovereign, be
that sovereign king or kaiser, nobility
or people, contrary to these antecedent
and superior rights are tyrannical
and unjust, are violences, not laws,
and the common-law courts will not
enforce them, because contrary to the
law of justice and forbidden by it.
The American state disclaims all authority
over the religion of its citizens,
but at the same time acknowledges
its obligation to respect in its
own action, and to protect and defend
from external violence, the religion
which its citizens or any class
of its citizens choose to adopt or
adhere to for themselves. It by no
means asserts its independence of religion
or its right to treat it with indifference,
but acknowledges its obligation
to protect its citizens in the
free and peaceable possession and
enjoyment of the religion they prefer.
It goes further, and affords religion
the protection and assistance of the
law in the possession and management
of her temporalities, her churches
and temples, lands and tenements,
funds and revenues for the support
of public worship, and various charitable
or eleemosynary institutions. All
the protection and assistance the benefit
of which every Protestant denomination
fully enjoys, and even
the Catholic Church in principle,
though not always in fact, would be
denied, if the divorce Dr. Bellows
demands were granted, and religion,
having no rights politicians are
bound to respect, would become the
prey of lawless and godless power,
and religious liberty would be utterly
annihilated, as well as civil liberty
itself, which depends on it.</p>

<p>The chief pretence with Dr. Bellows
for urging the complete divorce
of church and state, is that Catholics
demand and receive subsidies
from the state and city for their
schools and several charitable institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[690]</a></span>
Some such subsidies have
been granted, we admit, but in far
less proportion to Catholics than they
to Protestants or non-Catholics. The
public schools are supported at the
public expense, by the school fund,
and a public tax, of which Catholics
pay their share, and these schools
are simply sectarian or godless
schools, for the sole benefit of non-Catholics.
The subsidies conceded
to a few of our schools do by no
means place them on an equality
with those of non-Catholics. We
by no means receive our share of the
subsidies conceded. The aids granted
to our hospitals, orphan asylums,
and reformatories are less liberal
than those to similar non-Catholic
institutions. So long as the state
subsidizes any institutions of the
sort, we claim to receive our proportion
of them as our right. If the
state grant none to non-Catholics,
we shall demand none for ourselves.
We demand equality, but we ask no
special privileges or favors. The outcry
of the sectarian and secular press
against us on this score is wholly unauthorized,
is cruel, false, and unjust.
It is part and parcel of that general
system of falsification by which it is
hoped to inflame popular passion
and prejudice against Catholics and
their church.</p>

<p>Underlying the whole of the doctrine
of this discourse is the assumption
of the supremacy of the secular
order, or that every American citizen
is bound to subordinate his religion
to his politics, or divest himself of it
whenever he acts on a political question.
This, which is assumed and partially
disguised in Dr. Bellows, is openly
and frankly asserted and boldly
maintained in Judge Hurlbut's pamphlet.
The judge talks much about
theology, theocracy, etc., subjects of
which he knows less than he supposes,
and of course talks a great deal of
nonsense, as unbelievers generally
do; but he is quite clear and decided
that the state should have the power
to suppress any church or religious
institution that is based on a theory
or principle different from its own.
The theory of the American government
is democratic, and the government
ought to have the power to
suppress or exclude every church
that is not democratically constituted.
Religion should conform to politics,
not politics to religion. The
political law is above the religious,
and, of course, man is above God.
In order to be able to carry out this
theory, the learned judge proposes
an important amendment to the constitution
of the United States, which
shall on the one hand prohibit the
several states from ever establishing
any religion by law; and, on the other,
shall authorize Congress to enact
such laws as it may deem necessary
to control or prevent the establishment
or continuance of any foreign hierarchical
power in this country founded
on principles or dogmas antagonistic
to republican institutions. He
says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The following amendment is proposed
to Article I. of the amendments to the
Constitution of the United States. The
words in italics are proposed to be added
to the present article:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Art.</span> I. <i>Neither</i> Congress <i>nor any
state</i> shall make <i>any</i> laws respecting an
establishment of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof; or abridging
the freedom of speech, or of the press;
or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble and to petition the government
for a redress of grievances. <i>But Congress
may enact such laws as it shall deem necessary
to control or prevent the establishment
or continuance of any foreign hierarchical
power in this country founded on principles
or dogmas antagonistic to republican institutions.</i></p>

<p>"It is assumed that there is nothing
in the constitution, as it stands, which
forbids a <i>state</i> from establishing a religion,
and that no power is conferred on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[691]</a></span>
Congress by the constitution to forbid a
foreign hierarchical establishment in the
United States. If such a power be needed,
then the proposed amendment is also
necessary."&mdash;<cite>Secular View</cite>, p. 5.</p></blockquote>

<p>This proposed amendment, like
iniquity, lies unto itself, for while it
prohibits Congress and the several
states from making any law respecting
an establishment of religion or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof, it
gives to Congress full power to control
or prevent the establishment or the
continuance&mdash;that is, to prohibit&mdash;the
free exercise by Catholics of their
religion, under the flimsy pretence
that it is a foreign hierarchy founded
on anti-republican principles. The
hierarchy is an essential part of our
religion, and any denial of its freedom
is the denial of the free exercise
of his religion to every Catholic, and
of the very principle of religious liberty
itself, which the constitution
guarantees.</p>

<p>We of course deny that the Catholic
hierarchy is a foreign hierarchy
or anti-republican, for what is Catholic
is universal, and what is universal
is never and nowhere a foreigner; but
yet, because its Supreme Pontiff does
not reside personally in America,
and its power does not emanate from
the American people, Protestants,
Jews, and infidels will hold that it is
a foreign power, and anti-republican.
The carnal Jews held the Hebrew
religion to be a national religion, and
because the promised Messiah came
as a spiritual, not as a temporal and
national prince, they rejected him.
Infidels believe in no spiritual order,
and consequently in no Catholic
principle or authority; Protestants
believe in no Catholic hierarchy, and
hold that all authority in religious
matters comes from God, not through
the hierarchy, but through the faithful
or the people, and hence their
ministers are <em>called</em>, not <em>sent</em>. It
would be useless, therefore, to undertake
to prove to one or another of
these three classes that the Catholic
hierarchy is at home here, in America,
as much so as at Rome, and,
since it holds not from the people,
that it is not founded on anti-republican
or anti-democratic principles.
The only arguments we could use to
prove it lie in an order of thought with
which they are not familiar, do not
even recognize, and to be appreciated
demand a spiritual apprehension
which, though not above natural reason,
is quite too high for such confirmed
secularists as ex-Judge Hurlbut
and his rationalistic brethren,
who have lost all conception, not
only of the supernatural order, but
of the supersensible, the intelligible,
the universal reality above individual
or particular existences.</p>

<p>For Catholics there are two orders,
the secular and the spiritual. The secular
is bound by the limitations and conditions
of time and place; the spiritual
is above and independent of all
such conditions and limitations, and
is universal, always and everywhere
the same. The Catholic hierarchy
represents in the secular and visible
world, in the affairs of individuals and
nations, this spiritual order, on which
the whole secular order depends, and
which, therefore, is an alien nowhere
and at home everywhere. The Catholic
hierarchy is supernatural, not
natural, and, therefore, no more a
foreigner in one nation than in another.
But it is only the Catholic that can
see and understand this; it is too
high and too intellectual for non-Catholics,
whose minds are turned
earthward, and have lost the habit
of looking upward, and to recover it
must be touched by the quickening
and elevating power of grace. We
must expect them, therefore, to vote
the Catholic hierarchy to be in this
country a foreign hierarchy, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[692]</a></span>
it is nowhere national, and is no more
foreign here than is God himself.</p>

<p>The Catholic hierarchy is not
founded on democratic principles,
we grant, but there is nothing in
its principles or dogmas antagonistical
to republican government, if
government at all; but since it
holds not from the people, nor in
any sense depends on them for its
authority, non-Catholics, who recognize
no power above the people, will
vote it anti-republican, undemocratic,
antagonistical to the American system
of government. It is of no use to try
to persuade them to the contrary, or
to allege that it is of the very essence
and design of religion to assert the
supremacy of an order which does
not hold from the people, and is above
them both individually and collectively,
or to maintain in the direction and
government of human affairs the supremacy
of the law of God, which
all men and nations, in both public
and private matters, are bound to obey,
and which none can disobey with
impunity. They will only reply that
this is repugnant to the democratic
tendencies of the age, is contrary to
the free and enlightened spirit of the
nineteenth century, denies the original,
absolute, and underived sovereignty
of the people, and is manifestly
a return to the theocratic principle
which humanity rejects with
horror. To an argument of this
sort there, of course, is no available
answer. The men who use it are
impervious to logic or common
sense, for they either believe in no
God, or that God is altogether like
one of themselves; therefore, in no
respect above themselves.</p>

<p>It is very clear, then, if Judge
Hurlbut's proposed amendment to
the constitution were adopted, it
would be interpreted as giving to
Congress, as the Judge intends it
should, the power to suppress, according
to its discretion, the Catholic
hierarchy, and, therefore, the Catholic
Church in the United States,
and that, too, notwithstanding the
very amendment denies to Congress
the power to prohibit to any one the
free exercise of his religion! How
true it is, as the Psalmist says, "Iniquity
hath lied to itself." The enemies
of the church, who are necessarily
the enemies of God, and, therefore,
of the truth, are not able to
frame an argument or a law against
the church that does not contradict
or belie itself; yet are they, in their
own estimation, the <em>enlightened</em> portion
of mankind, and Catholics are
weak, besotted, grovelling in ignorance
and superstition.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the amendment
proposed by Judge Hurlbut
would, if adopted, effect the
object the Evangelical sects are conspiring
with Jews and infidels to
effect, so far as human power can
effect it&mdash;that is, the suppression of
the Catholic Church in the United
States, and it is a bolder, more direct,
and honester way of coming at it than
the fair-seeming but insidious amendment
proposed by Mr. Justice Strong,
of the Supreme Court of the United
States, and his Evangelical allies. It
is now well understood by non-Catholic
leaders that the growth of the
church cannot be prevented or retarded
by arguments drawn from
Scripture or reason, for both Scripture
and reason are found to be on
her side, and dead against them.
They see very clearly that if she is
left free with "an open field and fair
play," it is all over with her opponents.
They must then contrive in
some way, by some means or other,
to suppress the religious freedom and
equality now guaranteed by our constitution
and laws, and bring the
civil law or the physical power of
the state to bear against the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[693]</a></span>
and the freedom of Catholics.
That it is a settled design on the
part of the leading Protestant sects
to do this&mdash;and that they are aided
by Unitarians and Universalists, because
they know that Protestant
orthodoxy would soon go by the
board if the Catholic Church were
suppressed; by the Jews, because
they hate Christianity, and know
well that Christianity and the Catholic
Church stand or fall together;
and by unbelievers and secularists,
because they would abolish all religion,
and they feel that they cannot
effect their purpose if the Catholic
Church stands in their way&mdash;no one
can seriously doubt. We include the
Jews in this conspiracy, for we have
before us the report of a remarkable
discourse delivered lately in the Hebrew
synagogue at Washington, D. C.,
by the Rabbi Lilienthal, of Cincinnati,
entitled "First the State, then
the Church," which is directed almost
wholly against the Catholic
Church. We make an extract from
this discourse, longer than we can
well afford room for, but our readers
will thank us for it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Of all the questions which demand
our serious consideration, none is of more
importance than the one, 'Shall the
state or the church rule supreme?' All
over Europe, this question is mooted at
present, and threatens to assume quite
formidable proportions. There is but
one empire across the ocean in which
this problem, so far, has been definitely
settled by virtue of autocratic might and
power. It is Russia. When, in the
seventeenth century, the Patriarch of
Moscow had died, and the metropolitans
and archbishops of the Greek Church
met for the purpose of filling the vacancy,
Peter the Great rushed with drawn sword
into their meeting, and, throwing the
same on the table, exclaimed, 'Here is
your patriarch.' Since that time the
Czar is emperor and pope at once; and,
very significantly, the 'Holy Synod,' or
the supreme ecclesiastical court of Russia,
is presided over by a general, the
representative of the Czar. And hence
the Emperor Nicholas used to say: State
and church are represented in me; and
the motto ruling the Russian government
was autocracy, Russian nationality, and
the Greek Church.</p>

<p>"But everywhere else in Europe this
question agitates the old continent. In
Great Britain, Gladstone works for the
enfranchisement of the church; the
Thirty nine Articles, so renowned at Oxford
and Cambridge, are going to be
abolished, and High Churchmen and
Dissenters prepare themselves for the
final struggle. Italy, so long priest-ridden,
has inscribed on her national
banner the glorious words, 'Religious
liberty,' and means to carry them out to
the fullest extent, in spite of all anathemas
and excommunications. Spain,
though still timid and wavering, has
adopted the same policy. Austria has
thrown off her concordat, and inserted
in her new constitution the same modern
principle; and the German Empire has
fully recognized the equality of all citizens,
without difference of creed or denomination,
before the courts and tribunals
of resurrected and united Germany.</p>

<p>"But daily we hear of the demands of
the clergy, made in the interests of their
church. Since the last Œcumenical
Council has proclaimed the new dogma
of Papal infallibility, the bishops want
to discharge all teachers and professors,
both at the theological seminaries and
universities, who are unwilling to subscribe
to this new tenet of the Roman
Church. The Archbishop of Gnesen and
Posen even asked for the names of all
those men who at the last election of
members for the German Parliament did
not vote for those men he had proposed
as candidates. The government is now
bound to interfere, but nobody can tell
how this coming conflict between church
and state will be decided.</p>

<p>"This is the aspect of the old continent.
What is the prospect in America,
in our glorious and God-blessed country?
Of course, religious liberty, in the
fullest sense of the word, is the supreme
law of the land. It is the most precious
gem in the diadem of our republic, it
is warranted and secured by our constitution.</p>

<p>"The immortal signers of the Declaration
of Independence; those modern
prophets and apostles of humanity; those
statesmen who thoroughly appreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">[694]</a></span>
the bloody lessons of past history, knew
but too well what they were doing when
they entirely separated church and
state, and ignored all sectarian sentiments
in the inspired documents they
bequeathed to their descendants. The
denominational peace that heretofore
characterized the mighty and unequalled
growth of the young republic bears testimony
to their wisdom, foresight, and
statesmanship.</p>

<p>"But, alas! our horizon, too, begins to
be clouded. The harmony that heretofore
prevailed between the various
churches and denominations begins to
be disturbed. Then we had in the last
two years the conventions at Pittsburg
and Philadelphia. The men united there
meant to insert God in our constitution,
as we have him already on our coins,
by the inscription, 'In God we trust.'
They intend to christianize our country,
against the clear and emphatic spirit and
letter of the constitution. And I must
leave it to the learned judge of the Supreme
Court of the United States who
presided over those meetings, to decide
whether this future Christian country
hereafter shall be a Catholic or a Protestant
country.</p>

<p>"The Roman Catholic press and pulpit
are not slow in answering this question.
With praiseworthy frankness and manliness
they declare the intentions of their
church. Father Hecker says: 'In fifteen
years we will take this country and build
our institutions over the grave of Protestantism....
There is, ere long, to be
a state religion in this country, and that
state religion is to be Roman Catholic.'
Bishop O'Connor, of Pittsburg, says:
'Religious liberty is merely endured
until the opposite can be carried into
effect without peril to the Catholic world.'
The Archbishop of St. Louis says: 'If
the Catholics ever gain, which they surely
will, an immense numerical majority,
religious freedom in this country will be
at an end.' And the Pope speaks of the
'delirium of toleration, and asserts the
right to punish criminals in the order of
ideas.'</p>

<p>"This language is plain, unequivocal,
and cannot be misinterpreted. Still, I
am not an alarmist. I have too much
faith in the sound common sense of the
American people that they should barter
away their political birthright for any
theological or clerical controversy. They
are too much addicted to the policy of
'a second sober thought,' that, after
having first of all taught the human race
the invaluable blessings of religious liberty,
they should discard them just now,
when the whole civilized world is imitating
the glorious example set by our
great and noble sires.</p>

<p>"But, 'vigilance being the price of
liberty,' in the face of this assertion it is
not only right, but an imperative duty, to
enlighten ourselves on this all-important
subject, so that we may take our choice,
and perform our duties as true, loyal
citizens and true, loyal Americans."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is very much to the purpose,
and if it shows that the rabbi is no
friend of Protestant Christianity, it
shows that his principal hostility is to
the Catholic Church, as the body
and support of Christianity. He exults,
as well he may, over the falling
away from the church of the old
Catholic governments of Europe, for
one of the chief instruments in effecting
that apostasy has been precisely
his Hebrew brethren, the
great supporters of the anti-Catholic
revolution of modern times; and his
slanders on the Catholic Church are
in the very spirit of the Evangelical
Alliance, even to the false charges he
brings against distinguished individual
Catholics. The assertion that
"Father Hecker says, 'In fifteen
years we will take this country and
build our institutions over the grave
of Protestantism,'" as that other assertion,
"There is or ought to be a
state religion in this country, and
that state religion is to be Roman
Catholic,'" Father Hecker himself
assures us, is false. He never did,
nor with his views ever could, say
anything of the sort. Bishop O'Connor,
late of Pittsburg, never did and
never could have said, "Religious
liberty is merely endured until the
opposite can be carried into effect
without peril to the Catholic world."
We happen to know that his views
were and are very different; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[695]</a></span>
they were not, he is too shrewd to
commit the blunder of saying anything
like what is falsely attributed
to him, or to disclose such an ulterior
purpose. We may say as much of
the sentiment attributed to the Archbishop
of St. Louis. The archbishop
never uttered or entertained
it. Something like what is ascribed to
him was said, many years ago, by
Mr. Bakewell, in <cite>The Shepherd of the
Valley</cite>, a paper published at St.
Louis, but he was assailed by the
Catholic press all over the country,
and, if he did not retract it, at least
endeavored to explain it away, and
to show that he meant no such thing.
The archbishop never said it, and
was no more responsible for it than
was the Rabbi Lilienthal himself.
No Catholic prelate and no distinguished
Catholic layman even has
ever proposed any amendment to
the constitution in regard to the relations
of church and state in this
country, or has expressed any wish to
have the existing constitutional relations
changed, or in any respect
modified. The church is satisfied
with them, and only asks that they
be faithfully observed. She opposes
the separation of church and state
in the sense of releasing the state
from all moral and religious obligations,
for that would imply the subjection
of the church to the state,
and prove the grave of religious freedom
and independence, which she
always and everywhere asserts with
all her energy against kings, emperors,
nobilities, and peoples&mdash;against
Jew, Pagan, Mussulman, schismatic,
and heretic, and it is for this that
they conspire against her and seek
her destruction.</p>

<p>The rabbi says, "First the state,
then the church," which is as absurd
as to say, "First man, then God."
The state represents simply a human
authority, while the church, or the
synagogue even, represents&mdash;the
first for the Catholic, the second
for the Jew&mdash;the sovereignty of God,
or the divine authority in human
affairs, and the rabbi in his doctrine
is false alike to Moses and to Christ,
and as little of an orthodox Jew as he
is of a Christian believer. Yet he
agrees perfectly with Judge Hurlbut
and Dr. Bellows in asserting the supremacy
of the state or secular order,
and the subordination of the spiritual
order. We do not know whether the
rabbi means to approve or censure
the assumption, by Peter the Great,
of the headship of the Russian Church
and his government of it by the sword;
but Peter only acted on the principle,
"First the state, then the church,"
and the slavery of the Russian Church
to the state is only an inevitable consequence
of that principle or maxim.
The Russian Church, governed by
the Holy Synod, itself governed by
the Czar, presents a lively image of
the abject position religion would be
compelled to hold in every country
if the doctrine of the total separation
of church and state, and the independence
and supremacy of the state,
advocated by one or another of the
three men we are criticising, were to
prevail and to be embodied in the
civil code.</p>

<p>But let this pass. It is clear that
the rabbi, and therefore the Jews, so
far as he represents them, are to
be included in the great conspiracy
against the liberty and equality of
Catholics, or religious liberty recognized
and guaranteed by the American
states. Catholics are to be put
down and their church suppressed by
the strong arm of power. To prepare
the American people for this
proposed revolution in the American
system, this suppression of religious
liberty, a system of gross misrepresentation
of Catholic faith and practice,
of misstatements, calumnious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[696]</a></span>
charges, and downright lying respecting
the church, is resorted to and
persisted in as it was by the reformers
in the sixteenth century. "Lie,
lie stoutly," Voltaire said, though it
was said long before him; "something
will stick." We do not like to
say this, but truth will not permit us
to soften our statement or to use
milder terms. There is nothing too
harsh or too false for the anti-Catholic
press and the anti-Catholic preachers
and lecturers to say of our holy
religion, and nothing can be more
unlike the Catholic Church than their
pretended representations of her&mdash;too
unlike, indeed, even to be called caricatures,
for they catch not one of her
features. Even when the anti-Catholic
writers and speakers tell facts about
Catholics or in the history of the
church, they so tell them as to distort
the truth and to produce the
effect of falsehood, or draw inferences
from them wholly unwarranted.
We must, then, be excused if we
sometimes call the systematic misrepresentation
of our religion, our
church, and ourselves by its true
and expressive name, even though
it may seem harsh and impolite.
The batteries they discharge against
the church are not to be silenced
by bouquets of roses.</p>

<p>The public has become too well
informed as to Catholic doctrines
and usages to permit the repetition,
with much effect, of many of the old
charges and calumnies. Only the
very ignorant can be made to believe
that the church is the Babylonian
sorceress who makes the nations
drunk with the wine of her fornications;
that she is "the mystery
of iniquity"; that the Pope is "the
man of sin," or Antichrist; that our
nunneries are brothels, and their
vaults are filled with the skeletons
of murdered infants, of which Luther
discoursed to his friends with so much
unction in his Tischreden over
his pot of beer. These things are a
little out of date, and do not gain
the ready credence they once did.
The age is all for liberty, for progress,
for enlightenment; so the anti-Catholic
tactics change to suit the times.
James I. of England, as did the politicians
of France opposed to the Ligue,
charged the church with being hostile
to monarchy and the divine right of
kings. The charge now is that she
is opposed to republicanism, and denies
the divine right of the people,
or, more strictly, of the demagogues.
She is said to be a spiritual despotism,
the foster-mother of ignorance and
superstition, the enemy of science
and of progress, of intelligence and
liberty, individual and social, civil
and religious. Her religious houses
are dens of cruelty and tyranny, and
if she is permitted to continue and
spread her peculiar institutions over
this country, American democracy
will be destroyed, and American liberty
be but a memory, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The cry is not now, the truth is in
danger, the Gospel is in danger, religion
is in danger, but the republic is
in danger, democracy is in danger,
liberty is in danger. The church,
the moment she gets the power, will,
it is argued, abolish our political system,
establish a monarchy, abolish
religious liberty, and cut the throats
of all heretics and infidels, or send
them to the stake to be consumed in
a fire of green wood, as Calvin did
Michael Servetus. And there are not
wanting fools enough to believe it or
dishonest men enough to pretend to
believe it when they do not, though it
is evident that the republic is likely
to pass away, if things go on in the
political world as they are now going,
and be succeeded by anarchy or a
military despotism long before the
majority of the people will cease to
war against the church as anti-democratic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">[697]</a></span>
But the point to be noted
here is that all these charges assume
the supremacy of the secular order,
and allege not that the church is false,
is not the church of God, but that
she is hostile to democracy or democratic
institutions; in other words,
that she does not conform to popular
opinion, for democracy is nothing
but popular opinion erected into law.
Now, as we do not believe that popular
opinion, inconstant as the wind,
is infallible, or that the secular order
is supreme, we are not sure that it
would be a fatal objection to the
church even if what is alleged against
her were well founded. The arguments
against the church of this sort
are drawn from too low a level to
command any intelligent respect, and
they are all based on a false assumption.
Politics are not higher than
religion; the state is not above the
church; the secular order is not above
the spiritual; and it is only atheism
that can assert the contrary. To a
terrible extent, the supremacy of the
secular is the doctrine of our age and
country; but Catholics hold it to be
both false and dangerous, as incompatible
with the liberty and independence
of religion, with natural morality,
and even with the existence of
natural society, as it is with the sovereignty
of God. It is the doctrine
of the European revolutionists and
communists, and is sapping the life
and threatening the very existence
of our American republicanism&mdash;has
already reduced our government
to be little else than an agency for
promoting the private interests of
business men, bankers, manufacturers,
and railroad corporations. Our
elections are becoming a wretched
farce, for the monopolists govern
the government, let what party may
succeed at the polls. The State governments
cannot control them, and
the General Government just as little.</p>

<p>We will not so dishonor the church
or insult religion as to undertake to
refute these popular charges against
her, and to prove that her authority
is not incompatible with the existence
and salutary working of republican
government. The charges are addressed
to ignorance and prejudice;
we take higher ground, and maintain
that civil society can no more dispense
with the church, than the body
with the soul. The secular is insufficient
for itself, and needs the informing
life and vigor of the spiritual.
The political history of France since
1682, especially since 1789, proves
it to all men who are capable of tracing
effects to their causes. There is
no form of government more in need
of the church than the republican,
founded on the modern doctrine of
popular sovereignty, and the maxim,
the majority must rule. The habit
of regarding power as emanating from
the mass, as derived from low to
high, tends itself to debase the mind,
to destroy that respect for law, and
that reverence for authority, without
which no government performs in a
peaceable and orderly way its legitimate
functions. The American people
see nothing divine, nothing sacred
and inviolable, in their government;
they regard law as an emanation
of their own will, as their own
creation, and what creator can feel
himself bound to reverence and obey
his own creature? We need the
church to consecrate the government,
to give the law a spiritual sanction,
to create in us habits of reverence,
of submission, and docility, and to
impress us with the conviction that
civil obedience is a moral duty, and
that we must be loyal to legitimate
authority for conscience' sake. We
need the church to teach us that in
obeying the laws not repugnant to
the divine law, we are obeying not
men, which is slavery, but God, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">[698]</a></span>
is freedom, and the very principle of
all freedom. We need her to create
in us high and holy aspirations, to produce
in us those high and disinterested
virtues, without which civil government
is impotent for good, and
powerful only for evil. No man who
believes not in the sovereignty of truth,
in the supremacy of right, and feels it
not his duty to obey it at all hazards,
has the temper demanded in a republic,
and only the church can create it.</p>

<p>A government built on interest,
however enlightened, on sentiment,
however charming, or public opinion,
however just, is a house built on the
sand. It rests on nothing fixed and
permanent, is without stability or efficiency,
and tends always to fall and
bury the people in its ruins. We see
this in our own political history. It
would be difficult to find a government
more corrupt than ours, that
taxes the people more heavily, or that
does less for the public good, the advantages
we had at the start being
taken into the account. The good
that has been done, the great things accomplished,
have been accomplished
by the people in spite of the government,
and our record as a nation can
hardly put that of Prussia or Russia
to shame.</p>

<p>We do not choose to dwell on this
aspect of the case, although much
more might be said. We love our
country, have been bred to love republicanism,
and have the success of the
American experiment at heart. The
evils which the liberals charge to the
union of church and state, and hold
the church responsible for, spring, as
every impartial and intelligent student
of history knows, not from the union
but from the separation of church and
state, and the unremitting efforts of the
civil power to usurp the functions
of the spiritual power, and to make
the church the accomplice of its policy.
The terrible struggles of the
pope and emperor in the middle
ages had this cause and no other.
The pope simply sought to maintain
against the emperor the freedom and
independence of the church, the
kingdom of God on earth, that is,
true religious liberty. It is to the
partial, in some countries the complete,
triumph of the secular over the
spiritual, that we must attribute the
unsettled, disorderly, and revolutionary
state of contemporary society
throughout the civilized world, the
hatred or contempt of authority both
divine and human, the depression of
religion, the decline of intellectual
greatness, the substitution of opinion
for faith, a sickly sentimentalism for
a manly and robust piety, free-loveism
or divorce <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i> for Christian
marriage, and the general abasement
of character.</p>

<p>The evils are very real, but the
more perfect divorce of the state
from the church would not cure or
lessen, but only aggravate and intensify
them; nay, would to all human
foresight render them incurable. The
state without religion or moral obligation
is impotent to redress social
evils or to elevate society, and Protestantism,
which holds from the
people, and depends for its very
breath of life on popular opinion, is
no less impotent than the state. Protestantism,
having retained some elements
of religion from the church,
may, we readily concede, do something
to retard the fall of a nation
that accepts it, but when a Protestant
nation has once fallen, become
morally and politically corrupt, rotten
to the core, it has no power to
restore it; for it has no principle of
life to infuse into it above and beyond
that which it already has. Resting
on human authority, holding from
the nation or people, its life is only
the national life itself; and, of course,
when the national life grows weak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[699]</a></span>
its own life grows weak, and when
the national life is extinct, its own
life becomes extinct with it. Cut
off from the church of God, and
therefore from Him who is "the way,
the truth, and the life," it cannot
draw new supplies of life from the
Fountain of Life itself, with which
to revive and reinvigorate the fallen
nation.</p>

<p>This is wherefore there is no hope
for our republic under Protestantism.
There has been a sad falling-off in
the virtue, the honesty, the integrity,
the chastity, and public spirit of our
people in the last fifty years. The
old habits formed under Catholic discipline
and influences are wearing out,
if not worn out; intellectual culture
may be more general, though even
that may be questioned, but it is less
generous, thorough, and profound;
meeting-houses may be increased in
greater proportion than the population
itself, but theology is less studied&mdash;is
less intellectual, less scientific,
and is more superficial; and religion
has less hold on the conscience, and
less influence on life, public, private, or
domestic; and we may say, generally,
that in all save what belongs to the
material order, our republic has a
downward tendency. Now, since
Protestantism has nothing more or
higher than the republic, and no recuperative
power, how, then, can it
possibly arrest this downward tendency
and turn it upward, and save
the nation? Archimedes wanted
something whereon to stand outside
of the world in order to move it.
This Protestantism has not, for it
rests on the world, and has nothing
above the world or outside of it, and in
fact is only the world itself. To every
one who understands the great
law of mechanic force, which has its
analogue in the great principle of
moral or spiritual dynamics, it is
clear that the hope of the republic is
not and cannot be in Protestantism,
and there is just as little in the civil
order, for that, divorced from the
church and without any moral obligation,
is precisely that which needs
saving. The union of the various
Protestant sects in one organic body,
if it were possible, would avail nothing;
for the whole would be only
the sum of the parts, and the parts
having no supermundane life, the
whole could have none.</p>

<p>Hence we say that whatever hope
there is for our republic is in the
growth and predominance of the Catholic
Church in the minds and hearts
of the American people; and there is
a well-grounded hope for it only in
the prospect that she may before it
is too late become the church of the
great majority. The church has
what Archimedes wanted, and Protestantism
has not&mdash;the whereon to
stand outside and above the world.
She lives a life which is not derived
from the life of the world, and is
in communion with the Source of
life itself, whence she may be constantly
drawing fresh supplies, and
infusing into the nation a life above
the national life in its best estate,
and which, infused into the nation,
becomes for it a recuperative energy,
and enables it to arrest its downward
tendency, and to ascend to a new
and higher life. It is not without a
reason, then, founded in the nature of
things, that we tell our countrymen
that Protestantism may ruin the republic,
but cannot save it, any more
than it can the soul of the individual;
and that, instead of crying out against
the church like madmen, as hostile
to the republic, they should rather turn
their eyes toward her as their only
source of help, and learn that she
can and will save the republic, if
they will only allow her to do it.</p>

<p>Yet we urge not this as the motive
for accepting the teaching of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[700]</a></span>
church and submitting to her authority
and discipline. Our Lord says
to us, "Seek first the kingdom of
God and his justice, and all these
things shall be added unto you," but
he does not bid us or permit us to
seek the kingdom of God and his
justice for the sake of "these things,"
or the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">adjicienda</i>; he forbids us to
be solicitous for them, since it is for
them that the heathen are solicitous.
The only motive for a man to become
a Catholic, to believe what she
teaches and to do what she commands,
is that she is the kingdom of
God on earth, and that it is only in so
doing that he can possess "his justice,"
please God, or attain to eternal life.
Christ did not come, as a temporal
prince, to found&mdash;as the carnal Jews,
misinterpreting the prophecies, expected&mdash;an
earthly kingdom, or to create
an earthly paradise; but he came as
a spiritual prince to establish the reign
of his Father on earth in all human
affairs, and over all men and nations,
and whatever temporal good is secured
is not the end or reason of his
kingdom, but is simply incidental to
it. It is no reason why I should or
should not be a Catholic because the
church favors or does not favor one
or another particular theory or constitution
of civil government, but the
fact that she does not favor a particular
form of civil polity, if it be a fact,
is sufficient reason why I should not
favor it, for it proves that such form
is repugnant to the sovereignty of
God and the supremacy of his law.
As a matter of fact, however, the
church has never condemned any particular
form of civil polity or erected
one form or another into a Catholic
dogma, and a man may be a monarchist,
a republican, or a democrat,
as he pleases, and at the same time
be a good and irreproachable Catholic,
if he hold the political power
subordinate to the divine sovereignty.</p>

<p>The church is necessary to sustain
a republican form of government,
but it is also necessary to sustain any
other form, as a wise, just, and efficient
civil government. The error of
those we are combating is not in
that they are democrats or anti-democrats,
but in holding that the state
or secular order is sufficient for itself,
can stand of itself without the aid
of religion or the church, has no need
of the spiritual, and has in fact the right
to brush religion aside as an impertinent
intermeddler whenever it comes
in its way, or seeks to dictate or
influence its policy. This is a gross
error, condemned by all religion,
all philosophy, and all experience.
It is the old epicurean error that excludes
the divine authority from the
direction or control of human affairs,
and in its delirium sings,</p>

<p class="center">
"Let the gods go to sleep up above us."<br />
</p>

<p>It is at bottom pure atheism, nothing
more, nothing less. It is a
pure absurdity. Can the creation
stand without the creator? Can the
contingent subsist without the necessary?
Can the body live and perform
its functions without the soul
which is its principle of life; the dependent
without that on which it depends?
In the whole history of the
world, you will not find an instance
of a purely atheistical state, or a
state held to be completely divorced
from the spiritual order. There is
no instance in all history of a state
without some sort of religion, even
an established religion, or religion
which the state recognizes as its supreme
law, and does its best or worst
to enforce. We here, as well as in
England, as well as at any time in
any European country, have an established
religion which the law protects
and enforces on all its citizens,
only it is a mutilated religion, a religion
without dogmas, and called morality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">[701]</a></span>
If not so, whence is it the law
punishes murder or arson, and forbids
polygamy, or the promiscuous intercourse
of the sexes? Even Jacobins
erect their jacobinism into a religion,
and make it obligatory on the state
to persecute, to exterminate all who
dare oppose it. Have we not seen
it despoil the Holy See of its independence
and possessions, confiscate
the goods of the church, exile holy
bishops from their sees and their
country in Italy, and within a few
weeks shoot down the Archbishop
of Paris and a large number of priests
and religious, suspend public worship,
desecrate and plunder the
churches, and banish all religion but
their jacobinism from the schools?
No state tolerates any religion hostile
to its own established religion,
and the most intolerant and cruel
persecutors in the world are precisely
those who clamor loudest for religious
liberty.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a complete
divorce of church and state
practicable in any country on earth.
The only question is, Shall the state
be informed and directed by the infallible
and holy church of God, or
by the synagogue of Satan? No
man who is at all competent to pass
a judgment on the question but agrees
with the Syllabus in condemning not
the distinction, but the separation of
church and state; but the forms of
the union of the two powers, whose
harmonious action is necessary to the
normal state of society, may vary
according to circumstances. In countries
where the state refuses to recognize
frankly and fully the freedom
and independence of the spiritual
order, it may be necessary to regulate
the relation of church and state by
concordats; in others, where the
state recognizes the independence of
the spiritual order, and holds itself
bound to protect the rights of the
religion adopted by its citizens, as hitherto
with us, no concordats are necessary,
for the state does not claim
any competence in spirituals. In
this country the relation between the
two powers has, with a few exceptions,
been satisfactory, and the
church has been free. But there is
on foot a formidable conspiracy against
her freedom, and it is beginning to
be maintained pretty determinedly
that the majority of the people, being
Protestant, and the people being the
state, have the right and the duty as
the state to sustain Protestantism,
and outlaw and suppress the church.</p>

<h2>DRAMATIC MORALISTS IN SPANISH AMERICA.</h2>


<p>The truth is slowly dawning, at
least to curious minds, that the people
of the southern half of our New
World have tastes not dissimilar to
our own. Indeed, they seek other
arts than those of revolution, and,
here and there, have other stages
and actors than those which represent
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">pronunciamiento</i>, with all its
malicious bombast and insignificant
"sound and fury." We can count
poets, novelists, painters, sculptors,
scientists in the ranks of the most
distinguished men of our nearest sister
republic. Cuba, too, rejoices in
the genius of her philosophic scholar,
Caballero de la Luz, and of her poets,
Heredia and Gertrudiz de Avellañeda,
with the same spirit which
Mexico brings to her admiration of
the scientific versatility of Siguenza,
the quaint ideality of Sor Juana Inez,
and the literary culture of Carpio
and Pesado. Nevertheless, such facts
as these have aided but little in forming
the common estimate of Spanish-American
peoples, who are to some
of us scarcely more than a Bedouin
rabble fighting problematic wild-beasts
in the shape of pronouncers,
and struggling through clouds of desert-dust
and battle-smoke to the
light of freedom. That great rude
reserve of race, the Indians, without
which the business of one-half the
continent could not be carried on,
seems to be swept out of our moral
consideration as with a broom; yet
we must think hopefully of a race
which has produced an artist so extraordinary
as Cabrera and a ruler
so enduring and persistent as Juarez&mdash;hopefully,
at all events, of their
mere abilities, if mother church does
not teach us to look with a shrewder
and kindlier eye upon their moral
capabilities. In more than one country
of Spanish America we find Indians
among presidents, judges, governors,
congressmen, writers, artists;
and this being the case, historically
or actually, why should it be a
matter of surprise that Spanish America,
with whatever Old World culture
she may possess in union with
native aptitude, should have some
claims upon our attention on the
score of taste and intelligence? Part
of these claims we propose to set
forth.</p>

<p>The present writer has sat in the
orderly theatres of Vera Cruz and
Mexico, and seen performances substantially
as good as those of our
northern capitals. The <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zarzuelas</i>, or
operettas, of Barbieri and Gatzambide
were as pleasant in 1868-69 to their
hearers in the southern republic as
the French comic opera to New
Yorkers, and nevertheless seemed decent
and spirited; besides, the Mexicans
had the good fortune to enjoy
Gatzambide's personal direction of
his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Zarzuelas</i>, and Gatzambide (now
deceased) was one of the most popular
musicians of Spain. Another celebrity
the Mexicans honored in the
person of José Valero, a gentlemanlike
Spanish actor, whose superior in
versatile genius as tragedian and comedian
it would be difficult to find
anywhere. Entertainments were
plentiful in Moctezuma's city, though
subsisting, so to speak, upon diminished
rations. Round about all these
flickering pleasures flowed the strange
dark tide of Mexican life&mdash;its ragged
multitude, its concealed miseries, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[703]</a></span>
settled and common melancholy, not
to be dissipated by any class of illusions,
not to be shaken off in a day,
or a year, or any brief term of years.
Nevertheless, the misfortunes of a
war-worn people found as tasteful
and respectable a solace as their
theatres could afford. Their scholars
were even encouraged to revive and
celebrate some ancient glories of the
Mexican stage; and at the opening
of a season they crowned the bust
of one of the fathers of the Spanish
drama, whom with reason they regard
as among the greatest of the
small band of very eminent Mexicans.
This laurelled bust was but
one of a number to be seen in the
various theatres, in several instances
perpetuating the memory of Mexico's
own dramatic authors. On the occasion
referred to, poems by well-known
poets&mdash;and, among the rest,
if the writer remembers correctly,
an eloquent composition by the highly-esteemed
blind poet, Juan Valle&mdash;preluded
the revival of that celebrated
comedy, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Verdad Sospechosa</i>,
or, The Truth Suspected.</p>


<h3>JUAN RUIZ DE ALARCON.</h3>

<p>The author of this play was Alarcon,
that thoughtful writer who,
on the Spanish stage, ranks with
Lope, Calderon, Moreto, and Tirso.
Strange as it may appear to those
who doubt whether any good can
come out of Mexico, he was born
and bred in that mysterious country.
What his countrymen do not know
of their great artist, Cabrera, they
are able to tell of their chief literary
glory&mdash;namely, the place and date
of his baptism. Documents found
in the royal university of Mexico
established the several facts that Juan
Ruiz de Alarcon y Mendoza was
baptized in that city on the 2d day
of October, 1572, and received the
grade of licentiate or lawyer from
the university. It was for some time
asserted that he was born at Tasco
(for whose church Cabrera is said to
have painted extraordinary works);
but Chalco, not far from the capital,
has also laid claim to the honor
of his birth. He is represented as
short, ugly, and humpbacked. To
improve his fortunes, he sought the
literary life of Madrid, but his first
efforts were deemed of little importance.
By the year 1621 he had
written eight acted comedies, of
which <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Las Paredes Oyen</i> (The Walls
Hear) is esteemed the best, as also
one of the finest in any language.
In spite of his physical imperfections
his genius won him admirers, socially
as well as otherwise. In 1628, he
became clerk to the Council of the
Indies, and held his office till his
death in 1639; so that it seems our
author was a contemporary of Shakespeare,
Webster, Jonson, and other
great lights of the English drama.
His comedies are lauded as forming
a system of practical philosophy, inasmuch
as they give a delightful verification
of the proverbial wisdom of
his time, and preach capital sermons
from common texts. "Luck and
Labor," "The World's Favors," "No
Evil that does not come for Good,"
"Before you Marry see what you
are about," "The Truth made Suspicious,"
are the suggestive titles of
some of his dramas, which appear
to have lost nothing of their peculiar
excellence by pointing morals.
It was Alarcon who said:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To kill an enemy is argument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fearing him; but to despise and spare him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is greater chastisement, for while he lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is a witness of his own defeat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that kills, victory abbreviates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he that pardons makes it the more great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As meanwhile that the conquered lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The conqueror goes on conquering.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>To give to comedy a conscience
and a purpose is the distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">[704]</a></span>
design of Alarcon; but, while the
public of Madrid never failed to perceive
the moral of his humor, they
could yet heartily laugh at the wit
of his dialogues and the genuine
comicality of his situations. In his
plays cool reason walked hand in
hand with sentiment and pleasantry,
as they do in some of the most admired
comedies of our own stage.
The delight with which the Mexicans
witnessed <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Verdad Sospechosa</i>
proved that to Alarcon belonged
not merely the ingenuity by which
men are amused, but something of
that magic by which their own wit
and humor are excited. Alarcon
could give logic to a whim, a fancy,
or a passion. In the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Prueba de las
Promesas</i> his lover expostulates:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If Beauty's faithful lover I have been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esteeming though despised; loving, abhorred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What law allows to thee, what text approves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou shouldst hate me because I do love thee?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>An apology for woman made by
a servant in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Todo es Ventura</i> (Luck
is Everything) may be translated
thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What is it that we most condemn in maids?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inconstancy of mind? We taught them so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The love of money? It's a thing in taste&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or let that righteous fellow throw a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is not guilty of the self-same fault.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of being easy? Well, what must they do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If no man perseveres and all get tired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the fourth day of trying? Of being hard?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do we thus complain when we, too, all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run to extremes? If difficult our suit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We hate it, and if easy we despise.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ganar Amigos</i> (To Gain Friends)
Don Fernando has killed the brother
of Don Fadrique, and seeks and
obtains refuge with the latter, who,
however, does not know him. Don
Fadrique, though at length made
aware of the truth, faithfully keeps
the pledge he has given the slayer
of his brother. Seeing this, Don
Fernando gratefully exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<p>In the comedy of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mudarse por
Mejorarse</i> (To Change for the Better;
or, more literally, to Change in
order to Better One's Self), a certain
Don Garcia, who was to marry
Doña Clara, falls in love with her
niece Leonor; whence this dialogue:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Leonor.</i> Is it, perchance, Don Garcia,<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Leonor.</i> Then cannot you in one who'd be discreet<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>The discreet Leonor, compromised
by the entangling suit of Don Garcia,
is compelled to admit the attentions
of a gallant and rich marquis,
with whom at last she falls in love.
The following passage explains the
rest:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div></div></div>

<p>Here is the "retort courteous" in
its most charming humor. The gallant
grace and wit of these dialogues
are evidence of the original art
with which Alarcon could make his
comedy a study of life, and compel
his auditors to think somewhat after
they ceased to laugh. This is the
function of eminent high comedy,
though we may not ask that it shall
elaborate a severe or intrusive moral,
and though we admit its possession,
as in Shakespeare, of the liveliest
poetic qualities. Another passage,
this time from the famous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Verdad
Sospechosa</i>, wherein Don Beltran reprimands
his son, Don Garcia, for the
vice of habitual lying, will further
elucidate the method of Alarcon:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Beltran.</i> Are you a gentleman, Garcia?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">I am your son.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Beltran.</i><span class="s16">&mdash;And is it, then, enough,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">To be my son to be a gentleman?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Garcia.</i> I think so, sir.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Beltran.</i><span class="s12">&mdash;What a mistaken thought!</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consists in acting like a gentleman<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be one. What gave birth to noble houses!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The illustrious deeds of their first authors, sir.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without consideration of their births, the deeds<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Garcia.</i> That deeds give nobleness I'll not deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who will say birth does not also give it?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><i>Beltran.</i> Well, then, if honor can be gained by him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was born without it, is't not certain that,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With it?<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><i>Garcia.</i><span class="s8">&mdash;'Tis true.</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">So stout that you esteem yourself all able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have revenge when all the city says<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You lie? Is't possible a man can have<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But infamy and contempt?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Who could preach with more wit
a brief sermon like this than Alarcon?
It is no small honor to the
dramatist born in Mexico that the
great Corneille, who, if we may credit
the biographers of Alarcon, partly
translated and partly imitated <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">La
Verdad Sospechosa</i> in his famous
<cite>Menteur</cite>, could avow that he would
give two of his best plays to have invented
the happy argument of the
Spanish original. Molière and Voltaire
were also among the admirers
of the Spanish comedy, which Corneille
at first judged to be the work
of Lope de Vega. Of the general
merits of Alarcon, the following estimate
by his German critic, Schack,
which we find in a Mexican notice
of the dramatist, will doubtless suffice:
"Happy in painting comic characters
in order to chastise vice, as in
the invention and development of
heroes to make virtue adorable; rapid
in action, sober in ornament; inferior
to Lope in tender respect of
feminine creations, to Moreto in liveliest
comedy, to Firso in travesty, to
Calderon in grandeur and stage effect,
he excelled all of them in the
variety and perfection of his figures,
in the tact of managing them, in
equality of style, in carefulness of
versification, in correctness of language."
To this large and discriminating
praise we may add George
Ticknor's comprehensive dictum:
"On the whole, he is to be ranked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">[706]</a></span>
with the very best Spanish dramatists
during the best period of the
National Theatre."</p>


<h3>SOR JUANA INEZ DE LA CRUZ.</h3>

<p>It would not be proper to dismiss
from the list of Spanish-American
dramatic writers Sor Juana Inez de
la Cruz, although the subjects to
which this pious woman yielded her
inventive imagination were mainly or
wholly religious. She wrote, be it remembered,
in that remarkable seventeenth
century when a muse of religion
walked through the scenes of
the stage as well as through the
gardens of the convent. Then were
the patriarchs and apostles, the prophets
and saints, the chief personages
of a peculiar drama; and events
and circumstances of the divine
tragedy inspired such compositions
as the Loas and Autos. It is upon
one of these latter compositions that
her merit as a dramatic writer rests;
and we are glad to confirm in great
part an opinion of her genius hitherto
expressed by us, by here recalling
the judgment of that eminent European
critic of Spanish literature,
Bouterwek, the more especially as
our own Spanish scholar, Ticknor,
seems to have inflicted such ungracious
disparagement upon the subject
of our notice: "Much as Inez
de la Cruz was deficient in real cultivation,"
says Bouterwek, "her productions
are eminently superior to
the ordinary standard of female poetry....
The poems of Inez
de la Cruz breathe a sort of masculine
spirit. This poetic nun possessed
more fancy and wit than sentimental
enthusiasm, and whenever she
began to invent her creations were
on a bold and great scale. Her
poems are of very unequal merit,
and are all deficient in critical cultivation.
But in facility of invention
and versification Inez de la Cruz was
<i>not inferior to Lope de Vega</i>; and yet
she by no means courted literary
fame.... In her dramatic works
the vigor of her imagination is particularly
conspicuous. The collection
of her poems contains no comedies
properly so-called, but it comprises
a series of boldly conceived
preludes (loas) full of allegorical invention,
and it concludes with a long
allegorical auto, which is <i>superior to
any of the similar productions of Lope
de Vega</i>. It is entitled <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Divino
Narciso</i>, a name by which the author
designates the heavenly bridegroom....
It would be impossible to
give a brief and at the same time
intelligible sketch of this extraordinary
drama. With regard to composition,
it is very unequal; in some
respects offending by its bad taste,
and in others charming by its boldness.
Many of its scenes are so
beautifully and romantically constructed
that the reader is compelled
to render homage to the genius of the
poetess, while at the same time he
cannot but regret the pitch of extravagance
to which ideas really poetic
are carried. There is one peculiarly
fine scene, in which human nature,
in the shape of a nymph, seeks
her beloved, the real Narcissus, or
the Christian Saviour." The pastoral
passage, which in our notice of the
writings of Sor Juana we laid before
our readers, would seem to justify
the best praises of our literary historian,
Bouterwek. Ticknor, on the
other hand, speaks of her as a remarkable
woman, and not as a remarkable
poetess; and, upon the
whole, our thanks for the appreciative
reburnishing of the ancient fame of
an American genius&mdash;which, had it
shone in Massachusetts three hundred
years ago, would be deemed a
very rare jewel among Northern scholars&mdash;are
due rather to the European
Bouterwek than the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">[707]</a></span>
Ticknor. The latter observes
that she was born at Guipuzcoa; her
Mexican biographer says at San
Miguel de Nepantla, not far from
the city of Mexico, one of whose convents
she seems to have directed latterly.
Time, place, the inferior standard
of feminine culture, and the
prevalence of a false poetic school,
may account for Sor Juana's defects;
for the rest, the issue (a large one)
is between Bouterwek and Ticknor.</p>


<h3>EDWARD GOROSTIZA.</h3>

<p>After Alarcon, the principal lights
of the actual Mexican stage are Gorostiza,
Calderon, and Galvan; and,
indeed, whatever original triumph that
stage has enjoyed is almost if not
quite limited to these few excellent
though not glorious names. We
cannot with propriety name that extraordinary
woman, Sor Juana Inez
de la Cruz, in the list of Mexico's
dramatists, although, along with other
poetry, she wrote some religious
pieces in dramatic form. Nevertheless,
the credit which remains to the
literature of the country, after its few
phenomenal names are omitted, is
not inappreciable. Concerning Gorostiza,
Madame Calderon de la
Barca wrote: "Don José Eduardo
Gorostiza, a native of Vera Cruz, is
the son of a Spanish officer, and
when very young went to Spain,
where he was known politically as a
liberal. He was distinguished as a
writer of theatrical pieces, which have
been and still are very popular. One
of his pieces which we saw the other
evening at the theatre&mdash;<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Con Tigo
Pan y Cebolla</i> (With Thee, Bread
and Onions)&mdash;is delightful." Let us
add to Madame Calderon's brief notice
that Gorostiza won the rank of
lieutenant-colonel in the war against
Napoleon; that in 1823, while an exile
from Spain in London, he wrote
for the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>; and that
since then, as minister to England
and to the United States, and as secretary
of state and finance, he has
been eminent in the politics of his
native land. In 1836, he was made
intendant-general of the army, and
during the war between Mexico and
the United States took an active and
heroic part in the defence of Churubusco.
His efforts as a director of
the poor-house, as a friend of education,
and as the founder of a house
of correction, are also deemed worthy
of record. He died in 1851, at
the age of sixty-two.</p>

<p>The best known of Gorostiza's comedies
are those called <cite>The Intimate
Friend</cite>, <cite>Last Year's Fashions</cite>, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Don
Dieguito</i>, and <cite>Pardon for All</cite>, the last
being mentioned by his biographer
as celebrated. In the play of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Don
Dieguito</i>, which may serve as well as
any other to exhibit the character of
Gorostiza's plots, Don Anselmo, a
rich uncle, sends his nephew and
heir, Don Dieguito, to Madrid to
complete his education. While there,
Dieguito falls in love with Doña
Adelaida, whose father, Don Cleto,
is a lawyer. Don Anselmo goes to
Madrid to attend the wedding of his
nephew, but does not like the family
of his son's <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>, and, accordingly,
he schemes to break off the match.
The mother, Doña Maria, sees from
a worldly point of view the great
advantage of her daughter's marriage
with Don Dieguito. But now Anselmo
tells her that <em>he</em> intends to marry,
which excites her fear that his nephew
will inherit nothing from him.
She, therefore, proposes to her husband
that Doña Adelaida shall marry
the uncle, Anselmo, instead of the
nephew, Dieguito. Don Simplicio,
a friend of Don Cleto, endeavors to
effect a general reconciliation of interests,
and bring about the marriage
of the young couple; but, finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">[708]</a></span>
that father and mother alike wish to
break off the match, joins them in
insulting the apparently hapless Dieguito.
Don Anselmo at once perceives
that his nephew has been fooled,
and that the family of his betrothed
would be glad to cast off
Dieguito in order to capture his uncle's
wealth. He concludes, therefore,
to make his exit on the very
day of the proposed marriage, taking
with him his disenchanted nephew.
When the day arrives, he
announces that he has been ruined
by the shipwreck of a vessel from
Vera Cruz, and that he is compelled
to return to his old business of selling
pork, beans, chocolate, and sausages
to make good his loss. Don Dieguito,
though asked to return to his
allegiance as a lover, declares that
he is no fool, and prefers a wife who
will not speculate at the expense of
good faith, but will look after her
children. As Don Anselmo has told
the family of Doña Adelaida that
his principal loss is in a cargo of
chocolate, that spirited young lady
vows she will not drink chocolate
again; and the play ends in amusing
recriminations.</p>


<h3>FERNANDO CALDERON.</h3>

<p>The next of our dramatists, Fernando
Calderon, was born in 1809,
and died at the age of thirty-six,
having been a colonel, a state legislator,
a magistrate, and the secretary
of the government of Zacatecas, as
well as an industrious writer. The
most striking of his dramas are: <cite>The
Tourney</cite>, <cite>Anne Boleyn</cite>, and <cite>The Return
of the Crusader</cite>, which, says one
of his admirers, are full of noble and
chivalrous sentiments and spirited
action. Calderon's talent was nothing
if not dramatic; for even his
lyrics, and especially his <cite>Soldier of
Liberty</cite>, are characterized by a personal
fire and animation. His plays,
remarkable for warmth of sentiment,
and his poems, chiefly lyrical, gained
for him not only in Mexico, but in
other Spanish-American republics, a
degree of favor not often enjoyed by
writers in the southern part of the
New World. One of his most admired
passages is the soliloquy of
Isabella in <cite>The Tourney</cite>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And this is life. Seeing the sable bier<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Child, man, and most unfortunate womankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursue the magic and illusory shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which they call happiness, yet never find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gray-beard sad, complaining of his age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth would enjoy; but, imbecile, forgets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tortures that afflict his junior.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Life is a fever, a remediless fever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a frenzy violent and mad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! its pleasures pass us like a flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence follows gloom of soul with rain of tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever springs desire and fervid hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cheat our souls with what can never be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care and vacuity, and ephemeral joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These make themselves our poor reality.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fades our youth, and our declining life's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dismal light of undeception cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the narrow confines of the tomb....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black cloth ... and the coffin miserable ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus darkly flows the tide of life. Alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My end draws near, for which my spirit hopes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the wrecked sailor for a happy shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O cause of all my mourning my heart's balm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not thou, not even thou, wouldst me console:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None grieve for one that is already dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albert! Albert! shalt thou o'er my grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour out thy tears until our patient souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unite within the pure eternity.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>With good reason is this thoughtful
and feeling soliloquy prized by
Calderon's countrymen, whose vicissitudes
have taught them peculiar
sympathy with the tristful mood to
which he lends expression. The
tone and style of the passage are
tragic in a most dignified sense, and
reflect much credit upon Mexican
literature. A supplement to the views
of mortality and eternity set forth in
<cite>The Tourney</cite> is contained in a fragment
written by Calderon in 1825;
and as it may interest a Northern
public to know what a Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">[709]</a></span>
poet thinks of the future state, we
extract from it these hopeful lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cold and coward spirits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shun the thought of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unbelieving fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain-thinking that within the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have love and joy their end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dullards! who believe not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eternity divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The disembodied spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascends to regions high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of freedom and of bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love's sweet sentiment,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A seed sown in our souls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubt not God's hand doth guard it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead it up to him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul but breathes in love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is its essence and its food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And without love would die.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<h3>RODRIGUEZ GALVAN.</h3>

<p>More praiseworthy, in some respects,
than any of the modern poets
of Mexico, is Rodriguez Galvan, the
last of our trio of dramatists. He
died in 1842, in his twenty-sixth year,
after having without social advantages
acquired a high reputation as a lyrical
and dramatic writer. "At eleven
years," says his biographer, "he was
placed under the care of his uncle,
in a book-store at the capital," and
there his nightly studies made up for
the impediments of his daily occupation,
and "his happy disposition and
love for work supplied the want of
masters and fortune." An epical
fragment entitled "The Fallen Angel,"
and his poems, "The Tomb,"
and "The Girandole," together with
his dramas, "Muñoz" and "The
Viceroy's Favorite," are mentioned as
the most noted of his productions.
A specimen of his dramatic style is
the following piece of satire on
the modern stage, from <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Angel de
la Guarda</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let's think upon my comedy, and on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its plan. Hard, cruel hard, on all who are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Romantic. Here's a coxcomb come from Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Paris; next, an old man, ignorant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foolish, his friend a most judicious fellow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fine romantic maid who weeps and shrieks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Turkish; then, three hundred obscene gags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make the people laugh; a prudish dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who speaks French badly. Here's the knot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the conclusion? Why, a whistle from<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second prompter.<br /></span>
<span class="i18">&mdash;Or, I will erect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like to a gallows a cadaverous drama<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shock-full of hangings and adulteries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which <i>the seven infants</i> shall be shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children of a king of Acapulco.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This nauseous food I'll call a play-romance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'll divide it into four square parts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which further I'll divide in five full acts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scene in Aragon, the fifteenth century.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sources shall be dramas of Dumas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hugo, the immoral ones of course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What does it matter? I translate them mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stupid fellow comes out and drinks in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half of a tub of poison&mdash;gives the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight to his maid, because a vain old man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes with a trumpet-tongue to blow and blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his poor ears. The ignorant hind don't know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For two hours whether he is dead or not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the place of calling upon God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes a long discourse. This is the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They make our plays, and in this age of taste<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calderon, Moreto, Alarcon, Lope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are only mules; and in the theatre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their works shed slumber by the bucketful.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>It would require, perhaps, an intimate
knowledge of the Mexican
stage as it was thirty years ago to
appreciate the special application of
these lines; but it is plain that the
young dramatist conceived a genuine
contempt for a bloodthirsty and iniquitous
drama. What, then, must a
writer of his promise and aspirations
have felt regarding that more bitter
melodrama acted all round him?&mdash;what
must any poet with a tolerable
amount of contemplative wisdom
have thought of that political madness
of which Mexico has been so
long the victim? Certainly, it robbed
them, as it robbed others, of peace
and recompense; but war respects
the stage even when it destroys better
institutions, and it is probable that
the dramatic culture of Mexico is as
well preserved as any of which it can
boast. To Galvan is ascribed the
first effective production on the
Mexican stage of Mexican subjects.
Whether the following fable bears a
more than ordinary social meaning,
we cannot say; but it is an instance
of the poet's lively manner:</p>

<p class="center">THE SELFISH DOG.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With pike and lantern at sundown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grim night-watchman of the town<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Follows a lean dog as he flees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By order of the high police,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who persecute the dogs and tramps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take up drinking, murdering scamps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tolerate the robbers. Well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What matter? I've my tale to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starveling, feeling insecure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because a stranger, poor, demure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said, "Feet, what do I want you for?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, in a princely courtyard door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without "Good-day!" or e'en explaining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I must go in because it's raining,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sending up his card at all,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Myself. But a cur thereabout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barked hard at him, "Get out! get out!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"I'm dying with hunger." "Wretched hound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can a fine, superior person<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And insult after insult giving,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, the sad creature, turning tail,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Soon after this a dog forlorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost himself in the chase, and met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some wolves whose teeth were sharply set,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Has the tale pleased you? No? And why?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But some poor dog in misery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will raise his head, perhaps, and sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The simple fabulist don't lie."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now friend and critic both have I.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>There is nothing in Galvan's story
except his way of telling it, which is
certainly vivacious; but we esteem
it for some flashes of satirical meaning
cast upon a state of society of
whose animal life the "hungry dog"
is so commonplace an object. Not,
however, in his plays, which, if we
may credit his Mexican critic, sometimes
reveal a certain immaturity, did
Galvan find his very happiest expression.
He wrote the most touching
and charming lyric which, after much
search, we have been able to find in
Mexican literature. It was, we are
led to think, in 1842, when, as one of
a "legation extraordinary" to South
America, he sailed for Havana, there
to die of fever, that he wrote the
tender "Farewell to Mexico" which
his countrymen love to repeat:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upon the deck with longing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I watch the lonely main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on my fate I ponder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And muse in doubt and pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee I yield my fortunes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O Holy Maid above!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu, my own dear country,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adieu, thou land of love!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far in the western waters<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The red sun hides its light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now at last 'tis buried<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath the billows' might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roaring sea announces<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The weary day's decline:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adieu, beloved country,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adieu, thou land of mine!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>


<h3>AVELLAÑEDA AND MILANES.</h3>

<p>There is more of this excellent lyric,
but we let it pass in order to bring to a
moment's attention a few of the most
distinguished Cuban and South American
dramatic writers. We nowhere
discern the evidence of a luxurious
dramatic growth among our tropical
contemporaries; but as, in the most
advanced and varied circles of our
own literature, the drama holds but
an inferior modern regard, we cannot
deem this fact as peculiarly indicative.
Almost chief among the writers of
Cuba is Doña Avellañeda, to whom
we owe the novels of <cite>Sab</cite>, the <cite>Baroness
of Youx</cite>, the American romance
of <cite>Guatimozin</cite>, and the <cite>Undine of the
Blue Lake</cite>. She wrote four dramas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[711]</a></span>
one of which, her tragedy of <cite>Alfonso
Munio</cite>, is said to have made her famous.
For one of her poems she received
a crown of gold laurels from
the lyceum of Madrid, and her Catholic
devotion was signally manifested
by her poem of the <cite>Cross</cite> and her
Biblical drama of <cite>Saul</cite>. Surely, a
most prolific, industrious, and vigorous
writer was La Avellañeda, as her
countrymen admiringly call her, notwithstanding
her Isabellist attachments.
To the name of Avellañeda
let us add that of José Jacinto Milanes
as among the ornaments of
Cuban literature. His drama of
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Conde Alarcos</i>, founded upon the
celebrated Spanish tradition of the
name, is noted by Ticknor for its
passionate energy. Milanes seemed
to delight in the themes and scenes
of his own country; but his usefulness
as a writer was cut short, we are
informed, by a wasting infirmity.</p>


<h3>SANSON, MAGARINOS, AND MARQUEZ.</h3>

<p>Placido Sanson, Magarinos Cervantes,
and Señor Marquez are
among the most conspicuous South
American dramatists we can now
call to mind. Magarinos Cervantes
was born in Montevideo in
1825, and, besides the novels of
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caramuru</i> and <cite>The Star of the South</cite>,
has written the dramas of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vasco Nuñez</i>
and the <cite>Two Passions</cite>, besides the
comedy of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Percances Matrimoniales</i>.
He was one of the principal editors
of an artistic and scientific cyclopædia
printed in Madrid, and was once described
as the youngest and most productive
of well-known South American
writers. Sanson, who was born
in Santa Cruz de Teneriffe, 1815, has
written ten or eleven dramas, among
them <cite>Abenhamet</cite> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Herman Peraza</i>,
and has been an exceedingly industrious
editor and translator. Señor
Marquez, who was noticed fifteen
years ago as a young poet of Lima,
but twenty-three years of age, yet of
exceeding promise, was known as the
author of a drama which derived its
title from the beautiful legend of <cite>The
Flower of Abel</cite>.</p>

<p>This flower of dramatic poetry, as
its warm admirers regard it, contains
a charming and even what we might
call a religious moral. One of the
best known of its Peruvian critics described
it as among the most spiritual
creations of the day; a defense of innocence
and charity in a heroic combat
against the worldly selfishness
which devours us; and Markham,
to whose good taste we are indebted
for information respecting the ancient
and modern literature of Peru, affirms
that its plot is original and ingenious,
and that it is full of good
passages. Abel, the first victim of
selfishness, is described as "the mysterious
messenger of celestial compassion,"
an angel of innocence. The
innocent daughter of a proud and
aged veteran becomes the possessor
of the angel's flower of Abel&mdash;in
other words, the blossom of innocence.
This the heavenly visitor
presents to her in a vision, warning
her never to lose nor abandon
it, nor let it leave its place in her
bosom. But, eventually, the fair girl
loses the flower, and wanders far and
wide over the world in search of it,
passing through many dangers, for she
is unprotected and very beautiful. At
length, she reaches her mother's grave,
and, wearied and imploring, falls at the
feet of an image of the Blessed Virgin,
in whose hands she once more
beholds her lost Flower of Abel.
Prostrate before the altar of the
Queen of Heaven, the spirit of
Elena abandons the body, and is
conducted to the skies by Abel, who
recovers the mysterious flower and
the pure soul of the maiden.</p>

<p>Reflecting that our own American
dramatic literature can claim not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">[712]</a></span>
many successful writers, the portion
of Spanish America, in respect to the
dramatists we have described, cannot
be deemed contemptible. We
have much yet to learn of our sister
republics, painful though their problem
be to democratic thinkers; and
we cannot look through a more necessary
and suggestive medium than
their literature to become acquainted
with their moral capacities and possibilities.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>ALBERTUS MAGNUS VINDICATED.</h2>


<p>A most striking embellishment to
the text of a literary article is a deep
row of citations at the foot of the
page. The effect may be likened to
that of a broad trimming of lace to
articles of dress. A lace of true point
enhances the rich appearance of the
costliest tissue, and a common stuff
may be so set off by a Nottingham
trimming as to attract the gaze of
all who are passing. If unable to
distinguish the true from the false,
the gazer is astonished by the display.</p>

<p>Struck by the deep trimming of an
article that appeared in a recent
number of the <cite>American Journal of
the Medical Sciences</cite>, we examined it
thoroughly from the beginning to the
end. After perusal, we laid it down
with a warm recollection of the speech
of the country member in the Wisconsin
legislature, who, after listening to
an eloquent oration filled with classical
quotations, arose, and said: "Mr.
Speaker, the honorable gentleman
has roamed with Romulus, soaked
with Socrates, ripped with Euripides,
and canted with old Cantharides,
but what has all that to do with
the laws of Wisconsin?"</p>

<p>It would, however, be entirely out
of place in us to call attention to
this article, were it not for a most
extraordinary sentence which it contains,
and upon this we feel bound
by many considerations, amongst
which our reverence for truth and love
of propriety, to make some observations.
The sentence referred to is as
follows:</p>

<p>"About the year 1240, at the solicitation
of an inquisitive priest, Albertus
Magnus, the Bishop of Ratisbon,
wrote a very unepiscopal work
on the <cite>Secrets of Women</cite>. It contains
much prurient matter which
will hardly bear translation, and yet
was deemed worthy of a commentary
by so devout an ecclesiastic as
St. Thomas Aquinas."<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>In this sentence, in which two
great and good men are thus spoken
of, we maintain that there are at
least three glaring misstatements:
the first, that the work <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis
Mulierum</i> was written by the Bishop
of Ratisbon, Albertus Magnus, about
the year 1240; the second, that Albertus
Magnus wrote the work&mdash;positive
affirmation of that fact, as if
there were no doubt of its authenticity;
and the third, that St. Thomas Aquinas
ever wrote a commentary on it.</p>

<p><i>First Misstatement.</i>&mdash;That the work
was written about the year 1240, by
Albertus Magnus, Bishop of Ratisbon,
and therefore that it was the production
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[713]</a></span>of a bishop, although very
unepiscopal in its nature. We premise
a short sketch of his life, compiled
from the Protestant Cave
(<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Historia Literaria</i>, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sæculum Scholasticum</span>,
§1260): Albertus, surnamed
the Great, a German, was born in the
year 1205. He studied at Padua.
In the year 1221, he joined the Friar
Preachers. He was considered the
greatest theologian, philosopher, and
mathematician of his day. He excelled
especially in mathematics. In
the year 1236, on the death of the
general of the order, he governed the
same for two years as vicar. He
afterward became provincial of his
order in Germany, fixing his residence
at Cologne, where also he
taught with great applause. In the
beginning of the year 1260, he was appointed
Bishop of Ratisbon by Alexander
IV., and was obliged, against
his will, to undertake that responsibility.
He held the same for only
three years, when, wearied out by its
duties, he resigned the dignity, and
returned to his beloved monastery
of Cologne, where he spent his old
age in the delights of study. He
died in the year 1280. Such is the
substance of Cave's biography. Although
there is some doubt as to the
date of his birth, all agree that he
was made bishop in the year 1260,
and that during that time he had
enough to do in the affairs of his
diocese. The work in question, written
about the year 1240, cannot, therefore,
be rightly styled unepiscopal.
Besides, all the editions that attribute
the work to Albertus say that it
was written by him whilst stopping in
Paris. Thus, in the notes added by
some unknown author to the editions
of 1601 and 1637 these words are
found: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego Albertus morans Parisiis</span>"&mdash;"I,
Albert, staying in Paris."
The first words of the text are, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dilecto
sibi</span>," etc. As a bishop, we have no
record of his ever having been in Paris,
much less stopping there for a
time. As a very old man, it is said
that he made the journey once more
from Cologne. After resigning his
episcopate, he always lived and taught
at Cologne. We may therefore, with
justice, put down the word <i>unepiscopal</i>
as inaccurate.</p>

<p><i>Second Misstatement.</i>&mdash;The positive
affirmation of the fact that Albertus
Magnus was the author of the work
on the <i>Secrets of Women</i>. Admitting
that our examination has not
been as exhaustive as it might, owing
to the want of facility in consulting
many authorities we should have desired
to, what we shall produce we
hope will be sufficient to place beyond
doubt this one fact, that, if the
work is not wholly to be rejected as
that of Albertus Magnus, it must at
least be granted that it is very doubtful.
Our opinion is that it is wholly
supposititious. We have not found
a single authority which does not admit
that it is doubtful whether Albertus
Magnus was the author of it;
and the vast majority of critics and
several intrinsic arguments prove that
his name, as the famous one of the
age, was affixed to it to give it notoriety.
These propositions we will now
substantiate by negative and positive
arguments, some extrinsic and others
intrinsic, drawn from the character
of the author and of the writing
in question.</p>

<p>All admit that the authenticity
of the work is called in question.
We have consulted at least eighteen
distinct authorities in matters of bibliography,
and have not found one
making the positive affirmation of
the fact; and some of our authorities,
as, for instance, Cave and Fabricius,
refer to every critic of note up to
their time (Cave to no less than
three hundred and seventy-two authors).
Almost all positively deny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">[714]</a></span>
that the work belongs to Albertus
Magnus. Some make no mention
of it at all when speaking of his life
and labors. Others say in general
that many writings have been ascribed
to Albertus, in order to give them
notoriety, which, however, must be
rejected as supposititious. Thus, the
<cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, art. "Albert,"
vol. i., p. 171, says: "A detailed list
of Albert's works, the genuineness of
many of which it is impossible to determine,
is to be found in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scriptores
Ord. Prædicatorum</i> of Quétif
and Echard." Moreri, in his grand
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire Historique</i>, has nothing
at all about the book, and yet he
speaks at length of Albertus and his
works. Appleton's <cite>American Encyclopædia</cite>
makes no mention of it; neither
does Hallam, who would not have
passed by such a book, for he speaks
expressly of Albertus's influence on
medical studies. The Regensburg
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Universal Realen Encyclopedie</i>, edition
1850, art. "Albertus Magnus,"
says: "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sehr viele Schrifter wurden
ihm später fälschlich beigelegt</span>"&mdash;"Very
many works were at a later
period falsely ascribed to him."</p>

<p>These authorities are, however,
purely negative. We shall now bring
forward the positive proofs for the
same fact: <i>a.</i> Critics. <i>b.</i> Brunet. <i>c.</i>
Encyclopædias. <i>d.</i> Historians. <i>e.</i> Biographies.
<i>f.</i> Editions.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <i>Critics.</i>&mdash;It will be enough to
bring forward Fabricius, Boyle, and
Cave, all unexceptionable authorities.
Fabricius, Lipsiensis Professor, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibliotheca
Latina mediæ et infimæ ætatis</i>,
after referring to all the subjects
treated of in the twenty-one folio
volumes of the Lyons edition, the
only complete one ever published,
speaks of the works which must be
rejected, and among them he places
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber de Secretis Secretorum, sive de
Secretis Mulierum, sæpe editus sed suppositus
Alberto, qui plus simplici vice
in eo citatur</i>"&mdash;"The book on the
<cite>Secret of Secrets</cite>, or on the <cite>Secrets
of Women</cite>, often published but fathered
on Albertus, who is more than
once quoted in it." Boyle certainly
will not be accused of any partiality
for the great Catholic doctors of
scholasticism. In a long article on
Albertus Magnus, he has these words:
"I shall particularly mention some
falsities that have been reported about
him. It has been said that he delivered
women, and it was taken very
ill that a man of his profession should
do the office of a midwife. The
ground of this story is that there
was a book under the name of
Albertus Magnus, containing several
instructions for midwives, and so
much knowledge of their art that it
seemed he could not have been so
well skilled in that trade if he had
not exercised it. But the apologists
of Albertus maintained that he is not
the author of that book, nor of that
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis Mulierum</i>." He here refers
to a note in which he explains
as follows: "The book <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis
Mulierum</i>, wrongfully ascribed to Albertus,
is the work of one of his disciples,
who is called Henricus de
Saxonia, with whose name it has
been printed more than once. Here
are Simler's words: '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Henricus de
Saxonia, Alberti Magni discipuli, liber
de Secretis Mulierum impressus Augustæ</i>,'
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1498, per Antonium
Surg.; and in the <cite>Catalogue of Thuanus's
Library</cite> you will find, '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Henrici
de Saxonia, de Secretis Mulierum, de
virtutibus herbarum, lapidum quorumdam
animalium aliorumque</i>, 12mo,
Francof., 1615.' It is plain that Albertus's
name, more famous than
that of Henry, gave occasion to that
supposition." Thus far Boyle.</p>

<p>Cave in his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Historia Literaria</i> makes
no mention of the work as belonging
to Albertus.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Brunet, the great authority on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">[715]</a></span>

of this work, wrongfully attributed
to Albert the Great."</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <i>Encyclopædias.</i>&mdash;<cite>Edinburgh Encyclopædia</cite>,
conducted by David
Brewster, edition of 1832, art. "Albertus
Magnus:" "The treatise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis
Mulierum</i>, etc., generally ascribed
to him, was written by one of
his disciples, Henricus de Saxonia."
<cite>Penny Encyclopædia</cite>, London, 1833:
"There are also collections of supposed
<em>secrets</em> which have erroneously
been published under his name;
among others, one <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis Mulierum
et Naturæ</i>, printed at Amsterdam,
in 1655, which is believed to
have been written by one of his disciples."
<cite>Chambers's Encyclopædia</cite> rejects
the work also as supposititious.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> <i>Historians.</i>&mdash;Natalis Alexander,
<i>Hist. Ecc.</i>, Sæculum XIII., on "Albertus
Magnus," concludes his notice
thus: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liber <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Mirabilibus</i> vanitate

book <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Mirabilibus</i>, filled with
nonsense and superstition, has been
falsely ascribed to Albertus Magnus,
says Debrio in his work <cite>Essays on
Magic</cite>, cap. 3. The Medical Faculty
of the University of Louvain gave as
their opinion that the book <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis

any learned man, as Molanus relates
in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bibliotheca Sacra</i>."</p>

<p>Raynoldus, in his <cite>Cronaca</cite>, the
great continuation of the <cite>Annals of

scripta circumferri, quæ ab ipso nunquam
emanasse exploratum est; cum

particularly to warn the reader that
there are many writings extant attributed
to Albertus Magnus, which, it
is clear, never emanated from his
pen; for they are filled with magical
superstition; but to gain some authority
for a trifling or wicked work,
they are palmed off on the ignorant
under the name of a most pious and
learned man." Prof. Hefele, the
German historian, in an article on
Albertus Magnus in Wetzer and
Welte's <cite>Kirchen-Lexicon</cite>, concludes
thus: "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dem Albertus sind viele
Bücher unterschoben worden, z. B.
<cite>De Alchymia</cite> und <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis Mulierum</i>,
u. dgl.</span>"&mdash;"Many books have
been fathered on Albert, <i>e.g.</i> <cite>De Alchymia</cite>
and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis Mulierum</i>,
etc." Cantri, the Italian historian,
in his <cite>Universal History</cite>, expresses the
same opinion in his chapter on the
"Natural and Occult Sciences."</p>

<p><i>e.</i> <i>Biographies.</i>&mdash;Feller, in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Biographie
Universelle</i>, says: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfin, on
a lui attribué de ridicules recueils des
<cite>Secrets</cite>, auquels il n'a pas eu la
moindre part. On y trouve même
des indécences et des recherches

of <cite>Secrets</cite> have been attributed
to him, with which he had nothing
to do. Even obscene things are found
in this collection, and investigations
as frivolous as they are unworthy of
a religious." The French and German
biographies consulted by us
agree in this same opinion.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> <i>Editions.</i>&mdash;Dr. Atkinson, in his
<cite>Medical Biography</cite>, mentions all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">[716]</a></span>
editions of the work from the first in
1478 to 1760. The first edition, 1478,
is without the name of the place in
which it was printed; and of it we
have seen the judgment of Brunet.
The editions of 1480 and 1481 are
without the name of either printer
or place. The edition of 1484,
Augustæ, comes out with Henry of
Saxony as its author. Those of 1488
and 1498 also. The earliest editions,
therefore, cannot be quoted as making
Albertus the author of the work. It
was only the editions of 1600 and
those which followed that ascribed
the work to Albertus, and they were
almost all printed in Germany or
Holland. Does it not look as if
party spirit had much to do with
these editions? The only complete
edition of the works of Albertus is
that of the Rev. A. P. Peter Jammy,
S.T.D., in twenty-one folio volumes,
printed at Lyons, 1651. This edition
contains no mention of the book.</p>

<p>In the authorities thus far quoted,
we have studiously avoided bringing
forward any but those which are
universally admitted as standard.
But even should the extrinsic testimony
thus far given not have been
all on our side, we think the intrinsic
evidence would be quite sufficient to
settle the question. To this point we
will now briefly direct attention.
These intrinsic arguments are drawn
from the work itself and from the
well-known character of Albertus
Magnus. The book or document
was written somewhere about the
year 1240 or 1250, and was first
printed in the year 1478. Its composition
shows evidently that it was
intended only for the person to whom
it was directed; that it was merely a
letter to a friend in answer to an obscure
question proposed by him; in
fine, that it was not a treatise intended
for preservation, but merely a
familiar correspondence on the part
of the writer to satisfy, as far as he
was able, the inquiries of his friend.
Naudé, the critic, makes use of these
two proofs to show that Albertus
could not have written the work.
First, Albertus did not name himself
in the beginning of the work. He
who commented upon it affirmed
without any proof that Albertus was
its author. The text begins with
these words: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Delecto sibi in Christo
socio et amico</span>," etc.&mdash;"To his beloved
companion and friend in Christ. In
the notes added to the edition of
1601 and 1637 these words have
been placed as a title: "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego Albertus
morans Parisiis</span>"&mdash;"I, Albert,
staying in Paris." The title has been
affixed gratuitously and arbitrarily.
The work is therefore anonymous.
Second, Albertus could not have
written it, for his own authority is
often made use of. We must remember
that the document in question was
only a letter from one friend to another;
and it certainly would be strange
for a man to quote his own well-known
works at any time, much less in a
familiar correspondence. If he introduced
them at all, it would be in
some such form as this: "as you will
find in my work on," etc. The author
of this letter quotes Albertus's
authority at least five times. We
have verified the following in the
edition of 1637, Argentorati: Page
49: "That this may be understood,
we must note that there are four
states of the moon, according to Albertus
in his treatise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Statu Solis
et Lunæ</i>. Page 69, showing the impossibility
of a universal deluge, the
author says: "And we must know
that these things are not imaginary,
because Albertus, on the <cite>Action and
Effect of Lightning</cite>, mentions," etc.
Page 97, "For Albertus mentions just
as," etc. Page 109, "As Albertus
says in his book on," etc. We do
not argue from the fact of the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">[717]</a></span>
of Albertus being used to
prove that he could not have been
the author, but from the manner in
which that authority is introduced.
The reader will judge for himself if
our inference be correct. But to us
the convincing proof of the falsity of
the work is to be drawn from the
character of Albertus himself and the
subject matter of the work. The
testimony of antiquity has brought
him down to us as venerable for his
piety and goodness as he was illustrious
for learning. He was truly a
good man. He was really an exceedingly
learned man. The work ascribed
to him could have been written
by neither a good man nor even
a moderately well-educated man.
There are principles laid down in it
which contradict the first ideas of
morality and inculcate unbridled license.
And shall the well-known
works on morality of the great doctor
not be allowed to cry out in his defence?
Shall we say that he has not
only glaringly contradicted himself,
but become the open advocate of
immorality? When the illustrious
Protestant critic Cave tells us that
Albertus was considered the greatest
theologian, philosopher, and mathematician
of his day, he does but re-echo
the voice of each past generation;
and shall we say that he could
have written the work in question, so
full of nonsense and superstition,
and contrasting so strongly with his
other writings? Is not the opinion
of the Medical Faculty of the University
of Louvain more just when
they maintain that the work <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis
Mulierum</i> is neither that of
Albertus nor indeed of any learned
man at all? These few reflections
should be enough to settle the matter.
We could bring forward other and
far more convincing reasons in vindication
of this great doctor; but from
what has been said, we think we are
justified in placing the positive
affirmation of the writer ascribing
the work to Albertus Magnus as a glaring
misstatement&mdash;as blot number two.</p>

<p>The third misstatement was that
St. Thomas Aquinas wrote a commentary
on it. We challenge the
writer to bring a single authority to
prove that fact. We never heard or
saw anything about it before. None
of the great standard critics ever hint
at it; so, not to lose patience, we
affirm that it is the most glaring misstatement
made&mdash;blot number three,
in almost as many lines.</p>

<p>The reader might here naturally
ask, Where, then, did the writer obtain
any information on which to
base his so positive statements, so injurious
to the characters of two justly
celebrated benefactors of the human
race? We have met with but one
phrase which could have suggested
the lines in question, and they are
taken from a writer who should not
be brought forward as authority in a
matter of criticism; for the scurrilous,
filthy, and flippant manner in which
he speaks of authors and books renders
him unworthy of an answer.
This author is Dr. James Atkinson,
who published a <cite>Medical Biography</cite>,
one volume, A and B, London, 1834.
After admitting that the authorship
of the book <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Secretis Mulierum</i>
is a contested matter, he has these
words: "It may be a question whether
the editions (of which I have one in
Gothic characters) of this <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libellus
de Secretis Mulierum</i> were not
originally written by Albertus, and
published with a commentary (which
is annexed to it in my edition) by St.
Thomas Aquinas (although usually
'<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">non est inventus</span>') or Henricus de
Saxonia. Is it possible?" The
character of the author Atkinson, as
manifested in his work, and these
words themselves, are a sufficient answer
to any proof to be drawn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[718]</a></span>
his authority. We must say candidly
that these are the only words we
could find even to suggest the remarkable
lines we have quoted in the
beginning of this article; and we
conclude that we might have hoped
for the sincerity of Atkinson in one
who shows that, if he has tried to
read much, he has read neither wisely
nor well.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">A History of the Christian Councils.</span>
From the Original Documents, to the

of Theology in the University of
Tübingen. Translated from the German,
and edited by William R. Clark,
M.A. Oxon., Prebendary of Wells and
Vicar of Taunton. Edinburgh: T. &amp;
T. Clark, 38 George Street. 1871.
New York: The Catholic Publication
House, 9 Warren Street.</p></blockquote>

<p>The merits of Dr. Hefele's great
but still unfinished work are well
known and universally appreciated.
Certain portions of it rise to the excellence
of a masterpiece, and really
exhibit a genius almost, if not
quite, equal to that which is shown
in the <cite>Athanasius</cite> of Möhler and the
<cite>History of the Arians</cite> by Dr. Newman.
We refer especially to the
parts treating of the Arian and
semi-Arian controversies, and of the
history of the Council of Constance,
with the other synods preceding and
connected with it. We cannot, however,
consider the work of Dr. Hefele
as faultless. In our opinion, he
has signally failed in his treatment
of the celebrated cases of Liberius
and Honorius. In the present volume
there are, as it appears to us,
two manifest errors in regard both
to fact and doctrine. The first one
is found in the statement that confirmation
by a schismatical or heretical
bishop is invalid, and was judged
to be so by Pope Stephen and
the bishops of his time. The second
is the assertion that the baptism of
the Paulianists was rejected because
of the heresy professed by them,
and not because they had vitiated
the baptismal formula. It is strange
that so learned a professor could
not see that, if baptism in the name
of the Trinity was made invalid by
the fact that the Paulianists understood
by the terms Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost something different
from the true, Catholic sense of the
church, the baptism of the Arians,
and of all sorts of Unitarians, would
be made invalid by the same reason.
Almost all German authors have
a tone and an air as if everything
has to be proved from the beginning
anew, and this proof sharply
criticised by an infidel professor in
the next room. Dr. Hefele has this
air about him whenever he writes
about the constitutive principles of
the Catholic Church, and only loses
it when he has fairly plunged into
his subject and become carried
away by it. There is, moreover, a
perceptible, though not very deep,
tinge of what we may call ante-Vatican
theology in the introduction,
although one passage has been corrected
by the author since the council.
The learned and illustrious author
was always animated by an
orthodox and pious spirit, which he
has manifested by a truly apostolic
exercise of his episcopal authority
in sustaining and enforcing the decisions
of the Council of the Vatican.
Notwithstanding the accidental
defects of his great work, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">[719]</a></span>
is a monument not merely of ecclesiastical
learning, but of sound
Catholic doctrine, in which the supremacy
of the Holy See, and the
justice of its cause as against all
heretics, schismatics, and rebels, are
maintained with victorious logic and
overwhelming evidence. Its critical
character makes it especially valuable
for those who are studying the
history and constitution of the
church, and we are, therefore, sincerely
glad that one volume has
been translated into English and
published, and can only hope that
the others may follow.</p>

<p>The translation has been made by
a Protestant dignitary and published
by a Protestant firm, as the title at
the head of this notice has already
informed our readers. This seems
rather odd. We are glad to see a
taste for works like this arising in
the educated world, but can scarcely
understand what could induce a
Protestant, sincerely and firmly attached
to his own doctrine, to promote
their circulation. The author's
motives are, however, his own affair,
and the affair of his own ecclesiastical
connection. We have only
to criticise the manner in which he
has done his work, and for that we
are bound to accord him great
praise. Most judiciously, and to
our very great satisfaction, he has
refrained from giving us his own
opinions in prefaces or notes, and
has left Bishop Hefele in the state
in which he found him of pure, unadulterated
text. The translation
is undoubtedly substantially correct,
and, so far as we have seen, exact
and accurate in detail, while at the
same time it is smooth, readable
English. We have noticed only
one mistranslation, and that is one
which is wholly indefensible. This
is the substitution of <span class="smcap">Roman Catholic</span>
for <span class="smcap">Catholic</span>. We protest
against this alteration of Bishop
Hefele's language, and condemn it
as contrary to literary honesty, and
a real falsification of the text. The
volume is admirably printed, and is
for sale at The Catholic Publication
House, and we most cordially recommend
it to the attention of all
students of ecclesiastical history
who are unable to read the work in
German or French.</p>

<p>Whoever has the happiness of
knowing Canon Oakeley will think
he sees him and hears him talking
when he reads this book. Canon
Oakeley was well known many
years ago as a Fellow of Balliol College,
Oxford, and one of the most
distinguished of the brilliant band
of converts from that university.
As a Catholic priest, he has been
one of the most laborious and successful
among the parochial clergy
of London. His long experience
and eminently practical mind make
him unusually well fitted for writing
a work like the present. It is full
of admirable directions and suggestions,
among which those on preaching
especially attracted our attention.
Canon Oakeley's very remarkable
merits as a writer are too well
known to need our commendation.
The style of the present volume is
well worthy of the venerable author's
best days, and makes the
book delightful reading. We think
it is one which even the most experienced

found to be of the highest value to
young clergymen and ecclesiastical

Sixth edition. New York: The Catholic

<p>Father Young's hymn-book, well
known to many of our schools and
confraternities for the past eight
years, is now enlarged by the addition
of twenty-four hymns to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">[720]</a></span>
first edition. The best thing we
can say of the collection is that, of
the one hundred and thirty-one
hymns which it contains, not more
than half a dozen are beyond the
capacity or unsuited to the tastes of
the youth for whom it was designed.
The majority of the melodies are
original, and not to be found in any
other book of the kind. Every season
and festival of the year is represented
by a choice selection of appropriate
hymns, and the present
edition is enriched with the popular
congregational hymns sung in the
church of the Paulists during Lent,

We have no hesitation in saying
that it is the most complete and

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">American Religion.</span> By John Weiss.
Boston: Roberts Brothers. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>Precisely what it was that Mr.
Weiss proposed to himself in writing
the series of essays which he
dignifies by the title of "American
Religion," we do not find it easy to
say. He is one of those more unhappy
admirers of Mr. Emerson
who, in paying him the ready tribute
of a more or less perfect imitation
of the style of his speech and the
manner of his thought, have so far
beggared themselves as to leave
their readers in doubt as to what
their own thinking and their own
statement might have been, had
they in fact retained that individuality
the rights of which it seems
now only a part of their imitation
to assert. Mr. Emerson's style,
which is the fit expression of the
character of his mind, and in its
way perfection, has the unfortunate
peculiarity of being so mannered
that the least of his disciples can
successfully, and apparently unconsciously,
travesty it. Just what it
was, therefore, that Mr. Weiss had
in his mind concerning the new religion
which he desires to see adapted
to the supposed needs of America,
we do not know; but through
the fog in which his readers are perforce
doomed to flounder, it seems
as if he believes that the three
thousand miles of sea-water which
lie between his native land and the
Old World were a sufficient layer of
regeneration for those born on the
hither side of it. The sense of sin,
the need of an atonement, the efficacy
of prayer, are effete ideas
which have served their purpose in
the past, but which an American
citizen is better without. Why
should Yankee Doodle, who, as all
the world knows, is the latest and
fullest expression of what Mr. Weiss
likes to call the "Divine Immanence,"
bewail sins which are after
all either purely imaginary or the
result of a defective organization
for which he is not to blame; or
think himself in need of a mediator
with an offended God, when the real
truth is that he has only to step up
to the nearest square inch of looking-glass
to behold the Divinity in
himself and settle all outlying accounts
by word of mouth? Perhaps
we do Mr. Weiss an injustice, and, in
the twelve essays which form this
volume, he may have embodied more
and better ideas than the only one
which a tolerably attentive reading
has enabled us to gather from them.
But to us his book seems likely to
be as barren of suggestion to those
who would willingly agree with him
as it is to ourselves. Its prevailing
cloudiness is here and there broken
in upon by a sort of inane audacity
of expression when he refers to our
Lord and his miracles; but otherwise
it offers an unbroken uniformity
of platitude. It betrays, too, an
amusing ignorance of all modes of
thought alien to either the orthodoxy
or the rationalism of New
England, the provincialism of which
is in very pretty keeping with the
significant title which Mr. Weiss
has chosen for his work.</p>

<h2>THE REFORMATION NOT CONSERVATIVE.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></h2>


<p>Dr. Krauth is a man highly esteemed
in his own denomination, and,
though neither very original nor profound,
is a man of more than ordinary
ability and learning, well versed
in Lutheran theology, and, we
presume, a trustworthy representative
of it as contained in the Lutheran
symbolical books, and held by the
more conservative members of the
Lutheran Church&mdash;a church, or sect
rather, of growing importance in our
country, in consequence of the large
migration hither from Germany and
the north of Europe, and in some
respects the most respectable of all
the churches or sects born of the
Protestant Reformation, or, rather,
the Protestant revolt and rebellion
against the church of God. Yet he
will excuse us if we refuse to follow
him step by step in his exposition of
the Lutheran theology, for all that is
true in it we have in the teaching of
the Catholic Church, without the errors
and falsehoods Luther mingled
with it. It were a waste of time to
study it, unless we were called upon
to refute it in detail, which we are
not.</p>

<p>That there is much that is true
mingled with much more that is false
in Lutheran theology, we do not dispute,
and we readily admit that Dr.
Krauth means to hold, and in his
way does hold, most of the fundamental
principles, if not dogmas, of
Christianity; but this is no more than
we might say of any other system of
false theology, or of any heathen religion
or superstition, ancient or modern,
civilized or barbarous. There
is no pagan religion, if we analyze it
and trace it to its fountain, in which
we cannot detect most, if not all, of
the great primary truths of the Christian
religion, or the great principles
which underlie the dogmas and precepts
of the Catholic Church, and
which could have been obtained only
from the revelation made by God
himself to our first parents before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">[722]</a></span>their expulsion from the garden. Yet
what avails the truth false religion
conceals, mingled as it is with the
errors that turn it into a lie? It
serves, whether with the lettered and
polished Greek and Roman or the
rude, outlying barbarian, only as the
basis of barbarous superstitions, cruel,
licentious, and idolatrous rites, and
moral abominations. The fundamental
ideas or principles of civilized society
are retained in the memory of
the most barbarous nations and tribes,
yet are they none the less barbarous for
that. They lack order, subordination;
neither their intelligence nor their will
is disciplined and subjected to law;
and their appetites and passions, unrestrained
and untamed, introduce disorder
into every department of life,
and compel intelligence and will,
reason itself, to enter their ignoble
service, and as abject slaves to do
their bidding. Civilization introduces
the element of order, establishes
the reign of law in the individual, in
the family, in the state, in society,
which is not possible without a religion
true enough to enlighten the intellect,
and powerful enough over
conscience to restrain the passions
within their proper bounds, and to
bend the will to submission.</p>

<p>All Protestant sects hold much of
truth, but, like the heathen religions,
they hold it in disorder, out of its
normal relations and connections, out
of its unity and catholicity, and consequently
no one of them is strong
enough to recover the element of order,
and re-establish and maintain the
reign of law in any of the several
departments of life, spiritual or secular;
for the very essence of both
consists in rejecting catholicity, the
only source of order. We therefore
make no account of the principles,
truths, or even Catholic dogmas retained
by the various Protestant
churches or sects from Catholic tradition.
Held as they are out of unity,
out of their normal relations, and
mingled with all sorts of errors and
fancies, they lose their virtue, become
the basis of false religion and false
morality, pervert instead of enlightening
reason, and mislead, weaken,
and finally destroy conscience. They
are insufficient to preserve faith and
the worship of God, and naturally
tend to revive in a lettered nation
the polished heathenism of Greece
and Rome. Their impotence is seen
in the prevailing disorder in the whole
Protestant world, and especially in the
singular delusion of modern society,
that the loss of Catholic truth, Catholic
authority, of spirituality, is a
progress in light, liberty, religion, and
civilization&mdash;a delusion which counts
the revolutions, the civil commotions,
the wars between the people and the
government, between class and class,
and capital and labor, the insurrections
and terrible social disorders of
the last century and the present, only
as so many evidences of the marvellous
advance of the modern world
in freedom, intelligence, religion, and
Christian morals. Is not this the
delusion that goeth before and leadeth
to destruction?</p>

<p>Dr. Krauth has not advanced so
far, or rather descended so low, as
have some of his Protestant brethren.
He has strong conservative instincts,
and still retains a conviction that order
is necessary, and that without religious
faith and conscience order is
not possible. He has a dim perception
of the truth, that unless there is
something in religion fixed, permanent,
and authoritative, even religion
cannot meet the exigencies of society
or the needs of the soul; but, a child
of the Reformation, and jealous of the
honor of his parentage, he thinks it
necessary to maintain that, if religion
must be fixed and permanent, it must
at the same time be progressive; authoritative,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">[723]</a></span>
and yet subject to the faithful,
who have the right to resist or
alter it at will. Hence he tells us,
page viii., "The church problem is
to attain a Protestant Catholicity, or
a Catholic Protestantism," and seeks
to establish for Lutheranism the character
of being a "conservative reformation."
The learned doctor may
be a very suitable professor of theology
in a Lutheran theological seminary,
or a proper professor of intellectual
and moral philosophy in the
University of Pennsylvania, but he
seems either not to have mastered
the categories or to have forgotten
them. Contradictory predicates cannot
be affirmed of the same subject.
The Lutheran Reformation and conservatism
belong to different categories.
That only can be a conservative reform
of the church that is effected by
the church herself or by her authority,
and which leaves her authority and
constitution intact, by no means the
case with the Lutheran Reformation,
which was a total subversion of the
constitution of the church and the
denial of her authority. In the sense
of the author, conservative reformation
implies a contradiction in terms.</p>

<p>Logicians, at least those we have
had for masters, tell us that of contradictories
one must be false. If
there were ever two terms each the
contradictory of the other, they are
<i>Catholic</i> and <i>Protestant</i>. One cannot
be a Catholic without denying Protestantism,
or a Protestant without
denying Catholicity. "Protestant Catholicity"
or "Catholic Protestantism"
is as plainly a contradiction in
terms as a square circle or a circular
square. If Catholicity is true, Protestantism
is false, for it is simply the
denial of Catholicity; and if the Protestant
denial of Catholicity is true
or warranted, then is there nothing
catholic, no catholicity, and consequently
no catholic Protestantism.
Dr. Krauth has, we doubt not,
a truth floating before his mind's
eye, but he fails to grasp it, or to
consider to what it is applicable.
"The history of Christianity," he
says, page vii., "in common with all
genuine history, moves under the influence
of two generic ideas: the conservative,
which desires to secure the
present by fidelity to the results of
the past; the progressive, which looks
out in hope to a better future. Reformation
is the great harmonizer of
the true principles. Corresponding
with conservatism, reformation, and
progress, are the three generic types
of Christianity; and under these
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">genera</i> all the species are but shades,
modifications, or combinations, as all
hues arise from three primary colors.
Conservatism without progress produces
the Romish and Greek type
of the church; progress without conservatism
runs into revolution, radicalism,
and sectarianism; reformation
is antithetical to both&mdash;to passive persistence
in wrong or passive endurance
of it, and to revolution as a mode
of relieving wrong." That is, reformation
preserves its subject while
correcting its aberrations, and effects
its progress without its destruction,
which, if the subject is corruptible
and reformable, and the reform is effected
by the proper authorities and
by the proper means, is no doubt
true; and in this case reformation
would stand opposed alike to immobility
and revolution or destruction.</p>

<p>But is the learned and able professor
aware of what he does when
he assumes that Christianity is corruptible
and reformable, that it is or
can be the subject either of corruption
or of reformation? Intentionally
or not, by so assuming, he places
it in the category of human institutions,
or natural productions, left
to the action of the natural laws or
of second causes, and withdraws it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">[724]</a></span>
from the direct and immediate government
and protection of God. Not
otherwise could its history be subject
to the laws that govern the movement
of all genuine history, be either
perfectible or corruptible, or ever
stand in need of being reformed, or of
intrinsically advancing. Christianity
itself is a revelation from God, the
expression of his eternal reason and
will, and therefore his law, which
like himself is perfect and unalterable.
The terms the professor applies,
can apply, then, only to men's views,
theories, or judgments of Christianity,
not to Christianity itself, either
as a doctrine or an institution, either
as the faith to be believed, or as the
law to be obeyed&mdash;a fact which, in the
judgment of some, Dr. Newman's
theory of development overlooks
Christianity embodied in the church
is the kingdom of God on earth,
founded immediately by the Incarnate
Word to manifest the divine
love and mercy in the redemption
and salvation of souls, and to introduce
and maintain the authority of
God and the supremacy of his law
in human affairs. It is not an abstraction,
and did not come into the
world as a "naked idea," as Guizot
maintains, nor is it left to men's wisdom
and virtue to embody it; but
it came into the world embodied in
an institution, concreted in the church,
which the blessed apostle assures us
is "the body of Christ," who is himself
Christianity, since he says, "I
am the way, the truth, and the life."
Neither as the end nor as the divine
institution, neither as the law nor as
the authority to keep, declare, and
apply it, then is the church imperfect,
therefore progressive or corruptible,
and therefore reformable. This is the
Catholic doctrine, which must be retained
by Protestantism if Protestantism
is to be Catholic.</p>

<p>The learned professor either overlooks
or virtually denies the divine
origin, character, and authority of
the church, or else he supposes that
the divine founder failed to adapt
his means to his end, and left his
work incomplete, imperfect, to be finished
by men. From first to last, he
treats the church not as the kingdom
of God on earth, but as an institution
formed by men to realize or embody
their conceptions or views of
his kingdom, its principles, laws, and
authority. He thus makes it a human
institution, subject to all the vicissitudes
of time and space. As men
can never embody in their institutions
the entire kingdom of God, the
church must be progressive; as whatever
is defective may be corrupted
by the errors and corruptions of the
faithful, as what is subject to growth
must also be subject to decay, the
church may from time to time become
corrupt, and men must be free,
as she has need, to reform her. This
manifestly supposes the church is
not divine, but simply an attempt,
as is every false religion of men, to realize
or embody their variable conceptions
of the divine. If this were
not the professor's view, he could
not talk of conservatism, progress,
and reformation in connection with
Christianity, nor the correspondence
of these with "the three generic types
of Christianity," for these terms are
inapplicable to anything divine and
perfect, and can be logically applied
only to what is imperfect and human,
to what is perfectible, corruptible,
and reformable. As there is but
one God, one Christ, the mediator
of God and men, there can be but
one Christianity, and that must be
catholic, one and the same in all
times and places. To suppose three
generic types of Christianity is as absurd
as to suppose three Christs or
three Gods, generically distinguished
one from another, that is&mdash;three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">[725]</a></span>
Christs or three Gods of three different
types or genera.</p>

<p>Supposing the professor understands
at all the meaning of the scholastic
terms he uses, it is clear that
he understands by Christianity the
history of which moves under the influence
of two generic ideas&mdash;nothing
divine, nothing fixed, permanent,
and immutable, the law alike
for intellect and will, but the views
and theories or judgments which men
form of the works of God, his word,
his law, or his kingdom. Christianity
resolved into these may, we concede,
not improperly be arranged
under the three heads of conservatism,
progress, and reformation, but
never Christianity as the truth to be
believed and obeyed. We do not,
however, blame the Lutheran professor
for his mistake; for, assuming his
position as a Protestant to be at all
tenable, he could not avoid it, since
Protestants have no other Christianity.
They have only their <em>views</em> or
judgments of Christianity, not Christianity
itself as the objective reality.</p>

<p>There is progress <em>by</em> Christianity;
and that is one great purpose for
which it is instituted; but none <em>in</em>
Christianity, because it is divine and
perfect from the beginning. There
may be reformation in individuals,
nations, and society, for these are all
corruptible, but none of Christianity
itself, either as the creed or as the body
of Christ, for it is indefectible, above
and independent of men and nations,
and therefore neither corruptible nor
reformable by them. Not being corruptible
or capable of deterioration,
the term conservative, however applicable
it may be to states and empires
in the natural order or to human institutions
and laws subject to the
natural laws, has no application to
Christianity or the kingdom of Christ,
which is supernatural, under the direct
and immediate government and
protection of God, an eternal and
therefore an ever-present kingdom,
universal and unalterable, and not
subject to the natural laws of growth
and decay. Dr. Krauth forgets the
law of mechanics, that there is no
motion without a mover at rest.
The movable cannot originate motion,
nor the progressive be the cause
of progress, or corruption purify and
reform itself. If Christianity or the
church were itself movable, or in
itself progressive, it could effect no
progress in men or nations, individuals
or society; and if it could ever
become itself corrupt, it could be no
principle of reform in the world, or
in any department of life.</p>

<p>The office of Christianity is to
maintain on earth amidst all the vicissitudes
of this world the immutable
divine order, to recover men from
the effects of the fall, to elevate them
above the world, above their natural
powers, and to carry them forward,
their will consenting and concurring,
to a blissful and indissoluble union
with God as their supreme good, as
their last end or final cause. How
could it fulfil this office and effect its
divine purpose, if not itself free from
all the changes, alterations, and accidents
of time and space? Does
not the learned professor of theology
perceive that its very efficiency depends
on its independence, immovableness,
and immutability? Then
the conceptions of conservatism,
progress, and reformation cannot
be applied to the church of God,
any more than to God himself, and
are applicable only to what is human
connected with her. In applying
these ideas to her, the professor, as
every Protestant is obliged to do
in principle at least, divests her of
her divinity, of her supernatural origin
and office, and places her in the
natural and human order, and subjects
her to the laws which govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">[726]</a></span>
the history of all men and nations
deprived of the supernatural and remaining
under the ordinary providence
of God manifested through
second causes. The professor's doctrine
places Christianity in the same
category with all pagan and false
religions, and subjects it to the same
laws to which they are subjected.</p>

<p>This being the case, Dr. Krauth,
who is a genuine Lutheran, has no
right to call Luther's Reformation a
<em>conservative</em> Reformation. It may or
may not be conservative in relation
to some other Protestant church or
sect, but in relation to the church
of God, or to Christianity as the
word or the law of God, it is not
conservative, but undeniably destructive;
for it subverts the very idea
and principle on which the church
as the kingdom of God on earth is
founded and sustained. The church
on the principles of Luther's reformation
is subject to the authority of
men and nations, and, instead of
teaching and governing them, is
taught and governed by them, and
instead of elevating and perfecting
them, they perfect, corrupt, or reform
it. This is manifestly a radical denial,
a subversion of the church of
God, of Christ's kingdom on earth
if it means anything more than a
temperance society or a social club.
In this respect, the principle of the
Lutheran reformation was the common
principle of all the Protestant
reformers, as we may see in the
fact that Protestantism, under any or
all of its multitudinous forms, wherever
not restrained by influences foreign
to itself, tends incessantly to
eliminate the supernatural, and to
run into pure rationalism or naturalism.
How absurd, then, to talk of
"<em>Protestant</em> Catholicity, or of <em>Catholic</em>
Protestantism"! The two ideas
are as mutually repellent as are
Christ and Belial.</p>

<p>The church has, indeed, her human
side, and on that side she may
at times be corrupt and in need of
reform, that is to say, the heavenly
treasure is <em>received</em> in earthen vessels,
and those earthen vessels, though
unable to corrupt or sully the divine
treasure itself, may be unclean and
impure themselves. Churchmen may
become relaxed in their virtue and
neglect to maintain sound doctrine
and necessary discipline, and leave
the people to suffer for the want of
proper spiritual nourishment and
care, even to fall into errors and
vices more in accordance with the
heathenism of their ancestors than
with the faith and sanctity of the
Christian. Moreover, in a world
where all changes under the very eye
of the spectator, and new forms of
error and vice are constantly springing
up, the disciplinary canons of
the church, and those which regulate
the relations of secular society with
the spiritual, good and adequate
when first enacted, may become insufficient
or impracticable in view of
the changes always going on in
everything human, and fail to repress
the growing evil of the times and to
maintain the necessary discipline
both of clerics and laics, and therefore
need amending, or to be aided
by new and additional canons. In
this legislative and administrative
office of the church, not in her dogmas,
precepts, constitution, or authority,
which, as expressing the eternal
reason and will of God, are unalterable,
reforms are not only permissible
but often necessary. The councils,
general, national, provincial, and
diocesan, have always had for their
only object to assist the Papacy in
suppressing errors against faith in enforcing
discipline, maintaining Christian
morality, and promoting the purity
and sanctity of the Christian community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">[727]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not deny that reforms of
this sort were needed at the epoch of
the Protestant revolt and rebellion,
and the Holy Council of Trent was
convoked and held for the very purpose
of effecting such as were needed,
as well as for the purpose of condemning
the doctrinal errors of the
reformers; but we cannot concede that
they were more especially needed at
that epoch, than they had been
at almost any time previous, since
the conversion of the barbarians that
overthrew the Roman empire, and
of their pagan brethren that remained
in the old homesteads. Long,
severe, and continuous had been the
struggle of the church to tame, humanize,
and christianize these fierce
and indocile barbarians, especially
those who remained beyond the
frontiers of the empire, and to whom
the Roman name never ceased to be
hateful, as it is even to this day with
the bulk of the northern Germanic
races. The evils which for eight
centuries had grown out of the
intractable and rebellious spirit of
these races in their old homes, and
their perpetual tendency to relapse
into the paganism of their ancestors,
and which had so tried the faith and
patience of the church, had been in
a great measure overcome before the
opening of the sixteenth century, and
their morals and manners brought
into close conformity with the Christian
ideal. The church, through her
supreme pontiffs and saintly bishops,
zealous and hard-working priests and
religious, had struggled successfully
against them; and was even getting
the better of the polished Greek and
Roman heathenism, partially revived
in the so-called Revival of Letters,
or the Renaissance, and was
pursuing, never more steadily or more
successfully, her work of evangelization
and civilization; and we can
point to no period in her history
since the conversion of Clovis, king
of the Franks, the missionary labors
of St. Columbanus and his colonies
of Irish monks in Eastern Gaul and
Italy, and of St. Boniface and his
Anglo-Saxon companions and successors
in central Germany and the
Netherlands, when reforms were less
necessary, or the bonds of discipline
were less relaxed, than at the epoch
of the rise of Protestantism.</p>

<p>But, granting that reforms of this
sort were especially needed in the
sixteenth century, who had the right,
on conservative and orderly principles,
to propose or to effect them?
Certainly not private individuals on
their own authority, except so far as
it concerned their own personal
faith and morals, but to the ecclesiastical
authorities of the time, as we
see in the Holy Council of Trent.
Reforms, even if needed and proper
in themselves, if attempted by unauthorized
individuals on their own responsibility,
and carried out without,
and especially in opposition to, the
supreme authority of the church, are
irregular, disorderly, and unlawful.
A reform attempted and effected in
church or state by unauthorized persons,
and especially against the constituted
authorities of either, is unquestionably
an attempt at revolution,
if words have any meaning.
Now, was Luther's reformation effected
by the church herself, or by
persons authorized by her to institute
and carry it on? Was it done by
the existing authorities of the church
in accordance with her constitution
and laws, or was it done in opposition
to her positive prohibition, and
in most cases by violence and armed
force against her?</p>

<p>There is no question as to the fact.
Luther had no authority or commission
from the church to attempt and
carry out the reforms or changes he
declared to be necessary; and, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">[728]</a></span>
laboring to effect them, he proceeded
not only without her authority, but
against it, just as he does who conspires
to overthrow the state or to
subvert the constitution and laws of
his country. Luther, then, was not
a conservative reformer, but a
decided revolutionist, a radical, a
sectarian, a destructive, and Dr.
Krauth counts too much on the ignorance
or credulity of his readers in
expecting them to accept Lutheranism
as "conservative reformation."
A conservative reformation, as distinguished
from or opposed to revolution,
is a legal, constitutional reformation,
effected under the proper
authorities and by constitutional and
legal means. Dr. Krauth himself
would despise us or laugh at us if
we should concede that such was
Luther's reformation. It was effected
by persons unauthorized to reform
the church, against her constitution
and laws existing at the time, and
to which they themselves owed strict
fidelity and unreserved obedience.
They were conspirators against lawful
authority, against their spiritual
sovereign, and their pretended
reform was a revolt, a rebellion, and,
as far as successful, a revolution.
It is idle to deny it, or to attempt to
defend Luther and his associates on
legal and constitutional principles.
The reform or movement he attempted
was without and against law,
against the constitution and canons
of the church, and was condemned
and prohibited by the supreme spiritual
authority. This is undeniable,
and Dr. Krauth knows it as well as
we do, and yet he has the hardihood
to call it a "conservative reformation"!</p>

<p>But the Protestant pretence is that
Luther and his associates acted in
obedience to a higher authority than
that of popes and councils, and were
justified in what they did by the
written word of God and Christian
antiquity. An appeal of this sort,
on Protestant principles, from the
decisions of a Protestant sect, might
be entertained, but not on Catholic
principles from the decision of the
Catholic Church, for she is herself, at
all times and places, the supreme authority
for declaring the sense of the
written as well as of the unwritten
word, for declaring and applying the
divine law, whether naturally or supernaturally
promulgated, and for
judging what is or is not according
to Christian antiquity. Their appeal
was irregular, revolutionary even,
and absurd and not to be entertained
for a moment. She authorized no
appeal of the sort, and the appeal
could have been only from her judgment
to their own, which at the
lowest is as high authority as theirs
at the highest. Luther and his associates
did not appeal to a higher law
or authority against the popes and
councils, but to a lower, as Döllinger
has done in asking permission to appeal
from the judgment of a general
council, to that of a national or rather
a provincial council. The appeal
to Christian antiquity was equally
unavailable, for it was only setting up
their private judgment against the
judgment of the supreme court. The
church denied that she had departed
from the primitive church, and her
denial was sufficient to rebut their
assertion. In no case, then, did they
or could they appeal to or act on a
higher law or authority than hers.
They opposed and could oppose to
her judgment, rendered by popes
and councils, of the law or word of
God, written or unwritten, or of
Christian antiquity, only their own
judgment, which at the best was no
better than hers at the worst.</p>

<p>The simple fact is, there is no defence
of the so-called Reformation
on catholic, church, or conservative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">[729]</a></span>
principles. It sought to reform the
faith, and to change the very constitution
of the church, and wherever
it was successful, it proved to be the
subversion of the church, and the
destruction of her faith, her authority,
and her worship. Dr. Krauth says
that this was not originally intended
by the reformers, and that they had
in the beginning no clear views, or
fixed and determined plan of reform,
but were carried forward by the logic
of their principles and events to
lengths which they did not foresee,
and from which they would at first
have recoiled. But this only proves
that they were no divinely illumined
and God-commissioned reformers,
that they knew not what manner of
spirit they were of, that they took a
leap in the dark, and followed a
blind impulse. If the spirit they
obeyed, or the principle to which
they yielded, led them or pushed
them step by step in the way of destruction,
to the total denial of the
authority of the church, or to transfer
it from the pope and hierarchy
to Cæsar or the laity, which we know
was universally the fact, it is clear
proof that the spirit or principle of
the Reformation was radical, revolutionary,
destructive, not conservative.</p>

<p>That conservative men among Protestants
abhor the radicalism and sectarianism
which the whole history of
the Protestant world proves to be
the natural and inevitable result of
the principles and tendencies of the
so-called Reformation, we are far
from denying; but whatever of resistance
is offered in the Protestant
world to these results is due not to
Protestantism itself, but either to Catholic
reminiscences and the natural
good sense of individuals, to the control
of religious matters assumed by
the civil government, which really
has no authority in spirituals, or to
the presence and constant teaching
of the Catholic Church. "What is
bred in the bones will out in the
flesh." Everywhere the Protestant
spirit, the Protestant tendency, is to
remove farther and farther from Catholicity,
to eliminate more and more
of Catholic dogma, Catholic tradition,
Catholic precepts, and to approach
nearer and nearer to no-churchism,
to the rejection of all authority
in spiritual matters, and the
reduction of the whole supernatural
order to the natural. Faith in the
Protestant mind is only a probable
opinion, sometimes fanatically held
indeed, and enforced by power, but
none the less a mere opinion for that.
The conception of religion as a divine
institution, of the church as a
living organism, as a teaching and
governing body, as the kingdom of
God, placed in the world as the medium
of divine grace and of the divine
government in human affairs, is
really entertained by no class of Protestants,
but disdainfully rejected by
all as spiritual despotism, <i>Romish</i> usurpation,
or Popish superstition.</p>

<p>It is useless to say that this is a
departure from or an abuse of the
principle of the Protestant Reformation.
It is no such thing; it is only
the logical development of the radical
and revolutionary principles which
the reformers themselves avowed and
acted on, and which carried them to
lengths which, in the outset, they
did not dream of, and from which
Dr. Krauth says truly they would,
had they foreseen them, have
shrunk with horror. We do not
find that Lutheranism, when left by
the civil magistracy to itself, and
suffered to follow unchecked its
own inherent law, is any more conservative
or less radical in its developments
and tendency than Calvinism
or Anglicanism, that prolific mother
of sects, or any other form
of Protestantism. Every revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">[730]</a></span>
must run its course and reach its
goal, unless checked or restrained by
a power or influences foreign to itself,
and really antagonistic to it. The
reformers rejected the idea of the
church as a kingdom or governing
body, or as a divine institution for
the instruction and government of
men, and substituted for it, in imitation
of the Arabian impostor, a book
which, without the authority of the
church to declare its sense, is a dead
book, save as quickened by the intelligence
or understanding of its
readers. Their followers discovered
in the course of time that the book
in itself is immobile and voiceless,
and has no practical authority for
the understanding or the will, and
they cast it off, some, like George
Fox and his followers, for a pretended
interior or spiritual illumination,
the reality of which they can prove
neither to themselves nor to others;
but the larger part, for natural reason,
history, erudition, and the judgment
of learned or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> learned
men. Their work has gone on till,
with the more advanced party, all
divine authority is rejected, and as
man has and can have in his own
right no authority over man, reason
itself has given way, objective truth
is denied, and truth and falsehood,
right and wrong, it is gravely maintained,
are only what each man for
himself holds them to be. The utmost
anarchy and confusion in the
intellectual and moral world have
been reached in individuals and
sects said to have "advanced
views."</p>

<p>Such have been the results of Dr.
Krauth's "conservative reformation"
in the spiritual order, in Christianity
or the church. It introduced
the revolutionary principle, the principle
of individualism, of private
judgment, and insubordination into
the religious order, and, as a necessary
consequence, it has introduced the
same principle into the political and
social order, which depends on religion,
and cannot subsist without it.
Hence, the great and damning charge
against the church in our day is that
by her unchangeableness, her immovable
doctrines, her influence on the
minds and hearts, and hold on the
consciences of the faithful, she is the
great supporter of law and order&mdash;despots
and despotism, in the language
of the liberal journals&mdash;and the
chief obstacle to the enlightenment
and progress of society, in the same
language; but radicalism and revolution
in ours. Hence, the whole
movement party in our times, with
which universal Protestantism sympathizes
and is closely allied, is moved
by hostility to the church, especially
the Papacy. Hence, it and
the Protestant journals of the Old
World and the New are unable to
restrain their rage at the declaration
of the Papal supremacy and infallibility
by the Council of the Vatican,
or their exultation at the invasion of
the States of the Church, their annexation
to the Subalpine kingdom,
and the spoliation of the Holy Father
by the so-called King of Italy.
Why do we see all this, but because
the revolutionary principle, which the
reformers asserted in the church, is
identically the principle defended
by the political radicals and revolutionists?</p>

<p>Having thrown off the law of
God, rejected the authority of the
church, and put the faithful in the
place of the pope and hierarchy,
what could hinder the movement
party from applying the same subversive
principle to the political and
social order? The right to revolutionize
the church, and to place the
flock above the shepherd, involves
the right to revolutionize the state,
and the assertion of the right of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">[731]</a></span>
governed to resist and depose their
governors at will, or at the dictation of
self-styled political and social reformers.
Protestantism has never favored
liberty, as it claims, and which it is
impotent either to found or to sustain;
but its claims to be the founder
and chief supporter of modern liberalism,
which results naturally and
necessarily from the fundamental
principle of the reformers, that of
the right of the people to resist and
depose the prelates placed over them,
cannot be contested. If no man is
bound, against his own judgment and
will, to obey the law of God, how
can any one be bound in conscience
to obey the law of the state? and if
the people may subvert the constitution
of the church, and trample on
her divine authority, why may they
not subvert the constitution of the
republic, and trample under foot the
human authority of the civil magistrate,
whether he be called king or
president? It is to Protestantism
we owe the liberalistic doctrine of
"the sacred right of insurrection,"
or of "revolution" assumed to be
inherent in and persistent in every
people, or any section of any people,
and which justifies Mazzini and the
secret societies in laboring to bring
about in every state of Europe an
internal conflict and bloody war between
the people and their governments.
It deserves the full credit of
having asserted and acted on the
principle, and we hold it responsible
for the consequences of its subversive
application; for it is only the application
in the political and social order
of the principle on which the reformers
acted, and all Protestants
act, in the religious order against the
church of God.</p>

<p>The principle of revolution, asserted
and acted on as a Christian principle
by the reformers, has not been
inoperative, or remained barren of
results, on being transferred to modern
political and civil society. If
the reformation, by drawing off men's
attention and affections from the spiritual
order, and fixing them on the
material order, has promoted a marvellous
progress in mechanical inventions
and the applications of science
to the industrial and productive
arts, it has at the same time undermined
the whole political order, shaken
every civil government to its
foundation, and, in fact, revolutionized
nearly every modern state.
It has loosened the bonds of society,
destroyed the Christian family, erected
disobedience into a principle, a
virtue even, and reduced authority
to an empty name. It has taught
the people to be discontented with
their lot, filled them with an insane
desire for change, made them greedy
of novelties, and stirred them up to
a chronic war with their rulers. Everywhere
we meet the revolutionary
spirit, and there is not a government
in Europe that has any strong hold
on the consciences of the governed,
or that can sustain itself except by
its army. Even Russia, where the
people are most attached to their
emperor, is covered over with a network
of secret societies, which are
so many conspiracies against government,
laboring night and day to revolutionize
the empire. Prussia, which
has just succeeded in absorbing the
greater part of Germany, and is flushed
with her recent triumph over the
French empire and the improvised
French republic, may seem to be
strong and stable; but she has the
affections of the people in no part
of Germany, which she has recently
annexed or confederated under her
headship, and the new empire is pervaded
in all directions by the revolutionary
spirit to which it owes its
existence, and which may be strong
enough to resist its power, and reduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">[732]</a></span>
the ill-compacted body to its
original elements to-morrow.</p>

<p>We need not speak of Austria;
she may become hereafter once more
a power in Europe, but she is now
nothing. Voltairianism, and the spirit
generated by the Reformation,
have prostrated her, and sunk her so
low that no one deigns to do her
reverence. In England the government
itself seems penetrated with
the revolutionary spirit, or at least
believes that spirit is so strong in the
people that it is unsafe to resist it,
and that it is necessary to make large
and continual concessions to it. It
is a maxim with the liberals and most
English and American statesmen, or
politicians rather, for our age has no
statesmen, that a government is
strengthened by timely and large
concessions to popular demands. The
government is undoubtedly strengthened
by just laws and wise administration,
but in our times, when the
old respect for authority has gone,
and governments have little or no
hold on consciences, there is no government
existing strong enough to
make concessions to popular demands,
or to the clamors of the governed,
without endangering its power,
and even its existence. The Holy
Father, Pius IX., in the beginning
of his pontificate, tried the experiment,
and was soon driven from his
throne, and found safety only in
flight and exile. Napoleon III. tried
it in January of last year, was driven
by his people into a war for which
he was unprepared, met with disasters,
was defeated and taken prisoner,
declared deposed and his empire
at an end by a Parisian mob,
before the end of September of the
same year. The policy of concession
is a ruinous policy; one concession
leads to the demand for another
and a larger concession, and
each concession strengthens the disaffected,
and weakens the power of
authority to resist. But England has
adopted the policy, is fully committed
to it, as she is to many false and
ruinous maxims, and it will go hard
but she yields to her democracy, and
reaps in her own fields the fruits
of the liberalism and revolutionism
which she has, especially when under
Whig influence, so industriously
sown broadcast throughout Europe.</p>

<p>We need not speak of our own
country. Everybody knows its intense
devotion to popular sovereignty,
its hatred of authority, and its
warm sympathy&mdash;in words at least&mdash;with
every insurrection or uprising
of the people, or any portion
of the people, to overthrow the established
authority, whether in church
or state, they can hear of, without
any inquiry into the right or wrong
of the case. The insurrection or
revolutionary party, it is assumed,
is always in the right. There is no
more intensely Protestant people on
the globe than the American, and
none more deeply imbued with the
revolutionary spirit, in which it is
pretended our own institutions originated,
and which nearly the whole
American press mistake for the spirit
of liberty, and cherish as the American
spirit. What will come of it,
time will not be slow in revealing.</p>

<p>But France, so long the leader of
modern civilization, and which she
has so long led in a false direction,
shows better than any other nation
the workings of the revolutionary
spirit introduced by the Reformers.
She, indeed, repelled, after some
hesitation and a severe struggle, the
Reformation in the religious order;
but through the indomitable energy
of the princely Guises and their
brave Lorraine supporters, whom every
French historian and publicist
since takes delight in denouncing,
she was retained in the communion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">[733]</a></span>
of the church; but with Henry IV.
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti politique</i> came into power,
and Protestantism was adopted and
acted on in the political order. On
more occasions than one, France became
the diplomatic and even the
armed defender of the Reformation
against the Catholic sovereigns of
Europe. She was the first Christian
power to form an alliance with the
Grand Turk, against whom Luther
declared to be against the will of
God for his followers to fight, even
in defence of Christendom; she aided
the Low Countries in their rebellion
against Catholic Spain, Protestant
Sweden, and Northern Germany
in their effort to crush Catholic Austria,
and protestantize all Germany;
and saw, without an effort to save
her, Catholic Poland struck from the
list of nations. Twice has she with
armed force dragged the Holy Father
from his throne, and secularized
and appropriated the States of the
Church, and set the example which
the Italian Liberals have but too
faithfully followed. Rarely, if ever,
has she since the sixteenth century,
by her foreign policy, consulted the
interests of the church any further
than they happened to be coincident
with her own. In an evil hour, she
forgot the principles which made the
glory of the French sovereigns, and
on which Christendom was reconstructed
after the downfall of the
Roman Empire of the West, and
severed her politics from her religion.
At first asserting with the reformers
and the Lutheran princes the independence
of the secular order of the
spiritual, afterwards the superiority
of the secular power, and finally
the sovereignty of the people or
the governed in face of their governers,
as the reformers asserted the
sovereignty of the faithful in face of
the pope and hierarchy, she made her
world-famous revolution of 1789, inaugurated
the mob, and has been weltering
in anarchy and groaning under
despotism ever since.</p>

<p>The accession of Henry IV., the
beau ideal of a king with the French
people, marks a compromise between
Catholicity and Protestantism, by
which it was tacitly agreed that
France should in religion profess the
Catholic faith and observe the Catholic
worship, while in politics, both
at home and abroad, she should be
Protestant, and independent of the
spiritual authority. It was hoped
the compromise would secure her
both worlds, but it has caused her to
lose both, at least this world as every
one may now see. It is worse
than idle to attempt to deny the solidarity
of the French revolution with
Luther's rebellion; both rest on the
same principle and tend to the same
end; and it is the position and influence
of France as the leader of
the civilized world, that has given to
the revolutionary principle its popularity,
diffused it through all modern
nations, and made it the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weltgeist</i>,
or spirit of the age. The socialistic
insurrection in Paris, and which we
fear is only "scotched, not killed,"
is only the logical development of
'93, as '93 was of '89, and '89 of
Luther's revolt against the church in
the sixteenth century. Its success
would be only the full realization in
church and state, in religion and society,
of what Dr. Krauth calls "the
conservative reformation." The
communists deny the right of property,
indeed, but not more than did
Protestants in despoiling the church
and sacrilegiously confiscating the
possessions of religious houses and
the goods of the clergy. No more
consistent and thoroughgoing Protestants
has the world seen than
these French socialists or communists,
who treat property as theft and
God as a despot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">[734]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not exult in the downfall
of France, in which there are so many
good Catholics and has always been
so much to love and admire, any more
than, had we lived then, we should
have exulted in the downfall of the
Roman Empire before the invasion
of the barbarians. Like that downfall,
it is the breaking up of Christendom,
and leaves the Holy Father
without a single Christian power to
defend his rights or the liberty of the
Holy See; but it deprives Protestantism
of its most efficient supporter and
its great popularizer, and all the more
efficient because nominally Catholic.
It is not Catholic but Protestant and
liberal France that has fallen. The Bonapartes
never represented Catholic
France, but the principles of 1789&mdash;that
is, the revolution which created
them, and which they sought to use
or retain as they judged expedient
for their own interests. In the last
Napoleon's defeat we see the defeat,
we wish we could say the final defeat,
of the revolution. Yet so terrible
a disaster occurring so suddenly
to so great a nation, we think
must prove the turning-point in the
life and tendencies of the nations of
Europe, and pave the way for the
reconstruction of Christendom on its
old basis of the mutual concord and
co-operation of the two powers. We
think it must lead the nations to
pause and reflect on the career
civilization has for three centuries
been running, and open their eyes
to the folly and madness of attempting
to found permanent political and
social order, or authority and liberty,
on the revolutionary principle of the
Reformation or of 1789. We look
for a powerful reaction at no distant
date against the revolution in favor
of the church and her divine authority.
It is sometimes necessary to make
men despair of the earth in order to
turn their attention to heaven.</p>

<p>But to conclude: we have wished
to show Dr. Krauth that the Reformation
in any or all its phases, in its
principle and in its effects, in church
and state is decidedly revolutionary.
He as a Protestant has not been
able to see and set forth the truth;
bound by his office and position to
defend the Reformation, he has considered
what it must have been if
defensible, not what it actually was,
and has given us his ideal of the
Reformation, not the Reformation
itself. If it does not, he reasons,
maintain all Catholic principles
and doctrines it is indefensible;
but if it concedes that these principles
and doctrines, were held in their
purity and integrity in their unity
and catholicity, by the church Luther
warred against, what need was
there of it? Our good doctor must
then assume that they were not so
held, that the church had erred both
in faith and practice, and that the
Reformation simply restored the
faith, purified practice, re-established
discipline, freed the mind from undue
shackles, and opened the way for the
free and orderly progress of the
word. All very fine; only there does
not happen to be a word of truth in
it. Besides, if it were so, it would only
prove that the church had failed,
therefore that Christianity had failed,
and that Christ was not equal to the
work he undertook. If Christ is true,
there must always be the true church
somewhere, for she is indefectible as
he is indefectible. If the church in
communion with the See of Rome
had become corrupt and false, as the
reformers alleged, then some other
existing body was the true church,
and Luther and his associates, in order
to be in the true church, should
have ascertained and joined it&mdash;a
thing which it is well known they did
not do, for they joined no other
church or organic body, but set furiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">[735]</a></span>
at work to pull down the old
church which had hitherto sheltered
them and to build a new one for
themselves on its ruins.</p>

<p>We grant the Reformation should
have been conservative in order to
be defensible, but it was not so, it
was radical and subversive. It rejected
the Papacy, the hierarchy, the
church herself as a visible institution,
as a teaching and governing body,
and asserted the liberty of the faithful
to teach and govern their prelates
and pastors. It is the common principle
of all Protestant denominations
that the church is constituted by the
faithful, holds from them, and the pastor
is called not sent. This, we need not
say, is the subversion of all church
authority, of the kingdom of God
founded by our Lord himself, and ruling
from above instead of from below.
It reduces religion from law to opinion
or personal conviction, without
light or authority for conscience.
This principle, applied to politics, is
the subversion of the state, overthrows
all government, and leaves every man
free to do "what is right in his own
eyes." It transfers power from the
governors to the governed, and allows
the government no powers not
held from their assent, which is simply
to make it no government at all.
It has been so applied, and the effect
is seen especially in France,
which, since her revolution of '89, has
had no settled government, but has
alternated, as she alternates to-day,
between the mob and the despot,
anarchy and military despotism.</p>

<p>We so apply it, theoretically, in
this country; and in the recent civil
war the North was able to fight for
the preservation of the Union only
by pocketing for a time its principles
and forswearing its logic. The logic
was on the side of the South;
the force was on the side of the
North; on which side was the
right or the wrong, it is not our
province to decide. We will only
add that we do not agree at all
with journals that speak of the issues
which led to the war as being decided
by it. War may make it inexpedient
to revive them, but the only
issue it ever does or can decide is, on
which side is, for the time, the superior
force. We deny not the right
of the people to resist the prince who
makes himself a tyrant, if declared
to be such and judicially deposed by
the competent authority, but we do
deny their right, for any cause whatever,
to conspire against or to resist
the legitimate government in the legal
exercise of its constitutional powers.
We recognize the sovereignty of the
people in the sense that, if a case
occurs in which they are without any
government, they have the right, in
concert with the spiritual power, to
institute or reconstitute government
in such way and in such form as they
judge wisest and best; but we utterly
deny that they remain sovereign,
otherwise than in the government,
when once they have constituted it, or
that the government, when constituted,
holds from them and is responsible
to their will outside of the constitution;
for that would make the government
a mere agent of the people
and revocable at their will, which
is tantamount to no government at
all. The doctrine of the demagogues
and their journals we are not
able to accept; it deprives the people
collectively of all government, and
leaves individuals and minorities no
government to protect and defend
them from the ungoverned will and
passions of the majority for the time.</p>

<p>We accept and maintain loyally,
and to the best of our ability, the
constitution of our country as originally
understood and intended, not
indeed as the best constitution for
every people, but because it is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">[736]</a></span>
best for us, and, above all, because it
is for us the law. In itself considered,
there is no necessary discord between
it and Catholicity, but as it is
interpreted by the liberal and sectarian
journals, that are doing their best
to revolutionize it, and is beginning
to be interpreted by no small portion
of the American people, or as interpreted
by the Protestant principle,
so widely diffused among us, and in
the sense of European liberalism or
Jacobinism, we do not accept it, or
hold it to be any government at all,
or as capable of performing any of
the proper functions of government;
and if it continues to be interpreted
by the revolutionary principle
of Protestantism, it is sure to fail&mdash;to
lose itself either in the supremacy
of the mob or in military
despotism&mdash;and doom us, like unhappy
France, to alternate between
them, with the mob uppermost to-day,
and the despot to-morrow. Protestantism,
like the heathen barbarisms
which Catholicity subdued, lacks
the element of order, because it rejects
authority, and is necessarily incompetent
to maintain real liberty or
civilized society. Hence it is we so
often say, that if the American Republic
is to be sustained and preserved
at all, it must be by the rejection
of the principle of the Reformation,
and the acceptance of the
Catholic principle by the American
people. Protestantism can preserve
neither liberty from running
into license or lawlessness, nor authority
from running into despotism.</p>

<p>If Dr. Krauth wants conservatism
without immobility, and progress
without revolution or radicalism, as
it seems he does, he must cease to
look for what he wants in the Lutheran,
Calvinistic, Anglican, or any
other Protestant reformation, and
turn his thoughts and his hopes to
that church which converted pagan
Rome, christianized and civilized
his own barbarian ancestors, founded
the Christendom of the middle
ages, and labored so assiduously, unweariedly,
perseveringly, and successfully
to save souls, and to advance
civilization and the interests of human
society, from the conversion of
the pagan Franks in the fifth
century down to the beginning of
the sixteenth century, and which still
survives and teaches and governs,
in spite of all the effort of reformers,
revolutionists, men, and devils to
cover her with disgrace, to belie her
character, and to sweep her from the
face of the earth. She not only converted
the pagan barbarians, but she
recovered even the barbarian nations
and tribes, as the Goths, Vandals,
and Burgundians, that had fallen into
the Arian heresy, which like all
heresy is a compromise between
Christianity and heathenism, and
even reconverted the Alemanni,
Frieslanders, and others who had
once embraced the Gospel, but had
subsequently returned to their idols
and heathen superstitions. God is
with her as of old, and lives, teaches,
and governs in her as in the beginning;
and she is as able to convert
the heathen to-day, to reconvert the
relapsed, and to recover the heretical,
as she was in the days of St. Remi,
St. Amand, St. Patrick, St. Austin,
St. Columbanus, St. Willebrod, or St.
Boniface. She is the kingdom of
God, and like him she cannot grow
old, decay, or die. Never had her Supreme
Pontiff a stronger hold on the
consciences, the love and affections
of the faithful throughout the world,
than he has at this moment, when
despoiled of all his temporalities and
abandoned by all earthly powers, nor
ever were her pastors and prelates
more submissive and devoted to their
chief. Never did she more fully
prove that she is under the protection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">[737]</a></span>
of God, as his immaculate spouse,
than now when held up to the scorn
and derision of a heretical and unbelieving
world. Dead she is not, but
living.</p>

<p>Let our learned Lutheran professor
remove the film from his eyes, and
look at her in her simple grandeur,
her unadorned majesty, and
see how mean and contemptible, compared
with her, are all the so-called
churches, sects, and combinations
arrayed against her, spitting blasphemy
at her, and in their satanic malice
trying to sully her purity or dim
the glory that crowns her. Say what
you will, Protestantism is a petty affair,
and it is one of the mysteries of
this life how a man of the learning,
intelligence, apparent sincerity, and
good sense of Dr. Krauth can write
an octavo volume of eight hundred
closely printed pages in defence of
the Protestant Reformation.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>GENZANO AND FRASCATI.</h2>


<p>What is interesting to visitors in
Rome, and indeed in all Italy, is
not merely their stay in certain known
localities, or their sight-seeing within
a certain beaten track; it is also the
casual observation of less famous
and more intimate scenes, and the
residence in less crowded and more
attractive, because more peculiar,
neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The curious festival, more carnivalesque
than religious, that takes place
every Sunday in August in the Piazza
Narona, in Rome, and during
which pedestrians and carriage-goers
wade and splash through a shallow,
artificial lake, produced by the regulated
overflowing of the centre-fountain,
is a sight unfamiliar to
strangers and tourists, yet none the
less a very characteristic sport, and
interesting especially to such as view
Rome chiefly in a historic and antiquarian
light. Again, the "Ottobrate,"
a species of christianized bacchanalia,
an innocent merry-making
answering in some sort to our dear
old familiar gathering of "Harvest
Home," is a thing more often heard
of than witnessed by flying visitors
to the Eternal City. In October, also,
the Holy Father visits different convents,
and a few ladies not unfrequently
procure the privilege, through
"friends at court," of following in
his train, and thus gaining admittance
to strictly enclosed nunneries,
and being present at touching little
ceremonies performed very simply by
the Pope himself in the poor, plain
chapels of these voluntary prisoners
of love. Sometimes he says a few
words of encouragement and advice;
sometimes he gives benediction while
the untutored choir of nuns sing
some simple hymn; sometimes he
assembles the community, and gives
them his solemn blessing. There are
the "Celestines" (so-called from their
blue veil beneath the black one),
whose convent is in a retired street
not far from St. John Lateran, and
whose <i>enclosure</i> does not necessitate
a grating, but compels them to wear
their veils down while speaking to
strangers, and not to advance further
than the threshold of the inner house-door,
while their visitor stands without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">[738]</a></span>
the line, yet face to face with
them. There are the Dominicanesses,
near the Piazza Trajana, at "San
Domenico e Sisto," whose profession
is impressively accompanied by the
heart-stirring ceremony of prostration
beneath a funeral pall, while the
choir sing the solemn dirge of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Profundis</i>. When these nuns take
the habit and first become novices,
they are asked, at a certain part of
the service, whether they choose the
crown of thorns or the wreath of
roses, both of which lie before them
on a table. Of course there is but
one answer, but, the ceremony over,
the rose, or bridal wreath, replaces
for the day the coronal of thorns.
There is a convent of a very severe
order, called the "<i>Sepolte-Vive</i>," or
"buried alive," whose rule is almost
inhumanly severe, and has never received
absolute confirmation from
the Holy See, but only toleration, or
permission, for such as feel themselves
drawn to such appalling austerities.
They dig their own graves,
and wear fetters on the wrist, and,
when in fault, no matter how slight,
a placard on their backs indicating
their peculiar failing. When news
is brought to the superioress of the
death of a parent or relation of any
one of the sisters, the bereaved one
is not told of her loss, but it is announced
that "one among us has
lost a member of her family;" and
Masses are offered for the departed
without any further mention of him
or her. Again, there is a Carmelite
convent in Rome, I forget where, in
which a miraculous crucifix has been
preserved for about fifty years&mdash;a
strange image, which seems instinct
with life and expression, seems to
speak to and look at you, fascinates
the gaze, and stirs the least impressionable
heart. It is not much spoken
of even in Rome, that city where
marvels are no longer marvels, and
where miracles are more credible
than business negotiations elsewhere;
but it is enough that in one of these
Papal October visits to convents, two
persons of calm judgment, both English,
both converts, and one the sister
of an eloquent and gifted Anglican
divine, saw it, and declared that
there was something about it far beyond
the common run of even skilfully
carved and elaborately chiselled
masterpieces.</p>

<p>To pass from convents to hospitals,
the sight during the evenings of
Holy Week at the "Trinità de Pellegrini"
is something not less interesting
than the oft-recounted glories of
the Sistine Chapel and the thrilling
rubrics of the Pontifical High Mass
at St. Peter's shrine. Rome is still,
in this century, a real centre of pilgrimage;
and what could be a greater
proof of the truth of the faith she
teaches than this apparently incredible
fact&mdash;this <i>anachronism</i> in the
eyes of our enlightened progressists?
Men and women, chiefly from the
rural and mountainous districts of
Italy, but also from Hungary, and
Germany, and faithful Poland, come
begging their arduous way, in simple
faith and fervent love, perfectly
undisturbed by doubts they have
never heard discussed, by the "spirit
of the age" they have never dreamt
of as being in antagonism with the
spirit of the church, by the childish
and wilful gropings after religious
reconstruction which they, if they
knew of them, would call madness,
and pity as such. They come with
their strange tattered costumes, all
incrusted with dirt, and embroidered
into perplexing patterns with accumulation
of unheeded dust, and
knock at the door of this gigantic
hospital, where they find a real home
and a ready welcome. Other men
and women, chiefly of the higher
classes, and, like the pilgrims, of divers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">[739]</a></span>
nationalities, come to tend them
and offer them literally the same services
Abraham offered to the voyager-angels
when they stopped, travel-stained
and foot-sore, at the entrance
of his tent. In an upper hall are
laid tables laden with abundant and
wholesome food, of which a portion
is reserved by each wanderer for the
morrow's breakfast, and the disposition
of which, from personal observation,
I know to be as follows: a
small loaf of bread sliced in the middle,
and meat and sauce crammed as
tight as possible between the two
halves thus making a substantial
but somewhat ungainly sandwich.
In a large room on the lower floor
are placed benches against the wall,
with a foot-board running along
them, on which are rows of basins,
with the necessary adjuncts of soap
and towels. The washing of the
pilgrims' feet is by no means a sinecure,
or a graceful make-believe at
biblical courtesies. It is a very real
and slightly unpalatable business;
but the grievance is far more the
short time allowed to each person
than the washing itself. The unfortunate
feet of the weary pilgrims are
more refreshed than thoroughly cleaned
by one layer of soap; and it is
to be wished that the time allotted
could be sufficiently extended to allow
the work to be well done, since
it is attempted at all. The self-denial
of those who undertake this most
praiseworthy and mediæval charity
must be enhanced by the fact that
many tourists come to see this done,
as a part of their Holy Week <i>programme</i>,
and, being mostly curious
and carping critics of English or
American origin, their comments are
more sarcastic than encouraging.
Here are wildernesses of dormitories,
into which the pilgrims file in slow
procession after supper, singing litanies
and hymns. Let any other
country point to such a palace of
Christian charity, to such a freely
supported and admirably managed
institution, and then it may have
claim to talk of progressive civilization!
But instead of this, what do
we see but poor-laws, that treat
God's poor as animals, and the state
in which God himself chose to be
born, and live, and die, as a crime
and a moral shame. "Till when, O
Lord, till when?"</p>

<p>On Christmas night, another beautiful
scene takes place in the female
prison, on the "Piazza di Termini,"
opposite the baths of Aurelian, between
the railway station and the
church of the Cistercians, "Santa
Maria degli Loyoli." Yet there is
nothing to describe, no gorgeous ritual,
no impressive assemblage, no
pageant to take the eye and divide
the attention. Four whitewashed
walls, an orderly throng of uniformly
dressed women, a few hymns, in
which the voices of the nuns, in whose
charge the prisoners are, lead and
predominate; a plain altar, an unpretending
"Presepio," or representation
of the stable of Bethlehem, and
that is all. Well! what is there to
say about this? No correspondent
could fill a column with these details;
yet they fill the heart of God, and
make the heart of his sinless Mother
glad, as she looks down on the repentant
woman whose welfare is so
dear to her in whom there is found
no spot nor stain of guilt. And this
is very different, no doubt, from the
splendidly illuminated altar in <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">San
Luigi de Francesi</i>, where the lighted
tapers are pyramidally ranged in
dazzling tiers of shining amber brightness,
and where the fragrance of incense
struggles hard not to be overpowered
by the sweetness of the hot-house
plants blooming in clusters
around the steps and communion
rails. Very different, too, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">[740]</a></span>
artistic and elaborate "Presepio" at
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sant' Andrea della Valle</i>, where a veritable
stage seems miraculously poised
over the altar, and where all manner
of wonderful details of Eastern
scenery, somewhat mixed with prevailing
Western conceptions and incongruities
concerning the Orient, are
displayed on a magnificent scale for
the edification of the peasantry flocking
into Rome from all sides. Very
different, again, from the solemn ritual
of "Santa Maria Maggiore"
(though <em>that</em> has been for many years
discontinued, on account of the abuses
of which it was the unhappy occasion),
the ceremonies that renewed
most vividly the scene of the angels'
announcement, and the pastoral welcome,
on the moon-brightened
plains round the stable of Bethlehem,
the splendor of decoration gathered
about the precious relic of the rude
crib, whose straw, still preserved in
this church, is now more glorious by
far than conqueror's coat-of-mail or
emperor's robe of ermine. But what
of this difference, after all? Earth's
costliness of display is earthly still,
earth's poverty and nakedness is almost
divine, because, whenever earth
became the scene of any of God's
choicest wonders, it was always in a
state of destitution, which he ordained
beforehand as a mystical preparation.
God fashioned Adam out of common
clay, and Eve from a bare rib; his
own birth was in a stable, cold and
forlorn, his life in an obscure artisan's
shop, littered with common dust,
filled with coarse tools; his death
was on a common gibbet, on a bare
mountain. Common animals, domestic
drudges, and beasts of burden
surrounded him at the dawn of his
being; common criminals, rough
men, coarse-minded gazers, were
around him in his last hour. The
only time he rode in any state, it was
upon an ass, not a fancy war-steed with
trappings of oriental magnificence,
not even a stately mule, such as became
later on a recognized and legitimate
bearer of great dignitaries.
The first men who welcomed him on
earth were shepherds; the last who
spoke to him were fishermen. But
it is hardly necessary to say more on
a theme so well known and so much
canvassed; yet it is not unappropriate
to the frame of mind which this picture
of the midnight Mass in the prison
induces and fosters. And just
as it would be good for any Christian
country to be able to show a
hospital as well managed as the Pilgrim's
Home we have glanced at, so
would it be even better could any
one of the nations of Europe point
to prisons where repentance is taught
by the rule of the Gospel and not by
the regulations of a board of magistrates,
and where confinement for one
species of offence is not turned into
a school of graduation for worse offences
still.</p>

<p>The reader will forgive this roundabout
introduction to the two beautiful
reminiscences of which this paper
is the subject, for these are both
among the class of events described
at the beginning as less famous, but
more attractive because more peculiar.</p>

<p>One of them is of a private and
purely personal nature, the other of
a public sort, but rarer than reminiscences
of Rome usually are.</p>

<p>There is a village about twenty
miles from Rome, and two beyond
Albano, the name of which is Genzano,
and belongs, I believe, to the
Chigi family, as does Laricia with its
wild woods of chestnuts. It is an
ordinary hamlet, with its church
standing on a height to which two
side straggling streets lead up, and
the front of which is pretty well hidden
by the block of irregular houses
that divide the road-ways. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">[741]</a></span>
many generations this village had
been famous for its Corpus Christi
procession, and the peculiar way in
which the procession's track was
more carpeted than strewn with flowers.
Strangers used to flock to see
the floral festival, and Hans Andersen,
in his <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Improvisatore</i>, once
gave the most vivid and picturesque
account of it. Perhaps every one
has not read this description, and few
in this country at least have seen
the procession. In 1848, the custom
was discontinued, owing to the
unsettled state of the country, and
the tendency of the Carbonari to
make disturbances at any popular
gathering or demonstration, especially
of a religious kind. In 1864,
things being somewhat more stable
under the protection of French troops
and the promise of non-intervention
on the part of the King of Italy,
the festival of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Infiorata</i>, as it is
called, was again announced, and all
Rome hurried to see it.</p>

<p>It took place in the evening. No
description can do it justice, especially
as its beauty was enhanced by that
most hopelessly indescribable of circumstances&mdash;the
loveliness of a southern
summer's day. Albano looked
from its puny heights over the wide
plain that stretches to Ostia and the
sea, covered with dusky gray-green
olive-yards; the blue hills, where the
chestnuts grow and overshadow the
ruddy wealth of wild mountain strawberries
beneath, rose like cupolas in
the evening sky, that was alive with
summer lightnings; the bright red
and blue costumes of the peasant
women, with their little tents of spotless
linen squarely poised upon their
heads, and their massive chains of
gold and coral vying with their wonderful
sword-shaped hair-pins for
quaintness and for richness, stood
out in picturesque relief against the
dark background of the common-looking
dwellings; through the bustle
and clatter of an Italian crowd,
there could yet be discerned the hush
and stillness so familiar to our Northern
hearts, so congenial to our idea
of Sabbaths and church festivals; the
noise seemed a distant hum, the
whole scene a vision; and over it all,
the spirit of faith that made it what
it was, not a mere idle show to
awake idle people, but a living gathering
of living and believing souls,
offering nature's purest gifts in their
virgin integrity to the God of love, to
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Gesù Sacramentato</i>, as the Italians so
ingeniously and touchingly say.</p>

<p>Both streets leading up to the
church were paved with flowers, in
thick layers, symmetrically portioned
out with squares corresponding
to the width of the houses on either
side of the road. Patterns of great
delicacy were produced by these
flowers, scattered into petals as they
were, and no leaves nor stems carelessly
appearing anywhere. Here,
on one large space, were pictured
the arms of the Chigi family, there,
the arms of the bishop of the diocese,
further still, those of the Holy
See. In the centre of one of the
streets, the grand compartment was
taken up by a colored representation
of an altar with candles and a monstrance,
and the white Host within.
A little lower down was a tiny fountain,
more like a squirt than anything
else, concealed in a mound of soft
flower-petals. Patterns of geometrical
figures, of Persian carpets, of
fanciful monograms, filled up the
many squares, while all along the
sides, and supported by stakes, ran a
low festoon of box-wreaths, guarding
the flower-carpet from the feet of
the eager crowd.</p>

<p>From above, from the many balconies
and terraces, and from the
roofs of the tall, old-fashioned houses,
the people look down and gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">[742]</a></span>
upon this wonderful tapestry, more
elaborate and incomparably more
beautiful than the choicest produce
of the looms of Genoa, and Lyons,
and the <i>Gobelins</i>&mdash;more precious and
more fair than the silken hangings
woven of old by the hands of queens
and sovereign princesses.</p>

<p>And this is all for an hour! In a
few moments, the procession and the
following multitude will have passed
over the floral tapestry, and every
trace of its beauty will be gone.
But why not? Its beauty is consecrated,
and, when it has ministered
to the greater glory of God, its mission
will be over.</p>

<p>Every one knows the incident in
the life of Sir Walter Raleigh, when,
walking across a muddy road with
his imperious and capricious sovereign,
Elizabeth of England, the
gallant courtier's velvet cloak, costly
though it was, was not deemed too
rich for a woman's footstool, and
doubtless the graceful homage was
considered as very little beyond an
absolute necessity of courtesy. And
shall this display of rarest loveliness
and natural treasures, called the "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Infiorata</i>,"
be thought of otherwise
than as a cloak thrown beneath the
weary feet of the pilgrim Saviour?</p>

<p>Our Lord walks through many
lands, and the way of men's hearts
is very rugged here, very treacherous
there, very uneven everywhere. Let
him pause here for a moment, as he
rests his feet on the carpet or cloak
spread for him, and let him find in a
few faithful hearts a path ready prepared
for him, as fragrant and as
beautiful as this floral "via sacra."</p>

<p>The procession leaves the church
by one of the two diverging roads,
and returns by the other. It is a
regular Italian procession, somewhat
grotesque in our eyes, unaccustomed
to some little peculiarities, such as
winged angels represented by children
in scanty robes of tinselled muslin,
and golden paper kites flying
from their shoulders, but on the
whole it is edifying in its very artlessness.
There are many monks,
walking two-and-two, and bearing
lighted tapers; children in companies
and sodalities with gaudy banners
and streamers, priests in black
and white, and cross-bearers and
thurifers, and, lastly, the swaying canopy
under which is borne the Lord
of nature. While each person in
the procession winds his way among
the flower patterns, and carefully
spares the perfection of the design
as much as possible, the priest, on
the contrary, carries the Blessed Sacrament
right over in the centre of
the broad path, and the crowd pour
after him in heaving masses, leaving
the track behind them strewn with
remnants of box and olive borders
and blended heaps of crushed flower-petals.</p>

<p>And so the sacred pageant is over.
The sky is getting cloudy, and thunder-drops
of almost tropic rain are
falling noisily to the earth; people
hurry home, but long before Albano
is reached the storm is already furious,
and bursts over the darkening
plain. Many are detained at the
inns of the white village whose <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gallerie</i>
of elm and ilex are so famous
round Rome.</p>

<p>By the bye, these <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gallerie</i> lead from
Albano to the neighboring village of
Frascati, an archiepiscopal see, and
once the retreat of the Cardinal of
York, the last of the Stuarts. He
himself, with his unfortunate brother,
is buried in St. Peter's; but in
the village church of which he was
titular archbishop is a tablet to his
memory, recounting his many virtues,
and the love and veneration in which
his flock ever held him.</p>

<p>Frascati is the scene of the second
reminiscence I have once before spoken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">[743]</a></span>
of; one more domestic and more
intimate than the last, and very interesting
as being the record of an
unusual favor shown to a foreigner
by the Holy Father, Pope Pius IX.</p>

<p>There are a great many villas
around Frascati, and one of the prettiest
as well as most historical is the
Villa Falconieri, the whilom abode
of Santa Juliana Falconieri, to whom
a chapel is dedicated in the house.
The grounds are, as in most Italian
villas, very badly kept (according to
Northern ideas), but in their wildness
more beautiful than the trimmest
garden of Old or New England.
A winding, steep road, bordered with
box, leads to the mansion, whose
wide marble chambers re-echo the
few footsteps they ever bear, and
whose best preserved ornaments are
some marble busts and old frescoes.
To the front stretches a lawn dotted
with Spanish chestnut-trees, and beyond
lies an alley of hoary and gigantic
cypresses that seem the enchanted
genii of perpetual silence.
There is a peculiar odor about cypress-trees
which can never be forgotten
by one who has been much
among these groves of living columns;
and it is a well-known fact that the
charm inherent in a familiar odor is
one of the strongest that exists. Not
only in this alley, a mile long, leading
up through a maze of thickets to
the ruins of Tusculum, but also in a
weird quadrangle planted round a
stone-coped pond, do these trees
stand in their stern and sad majesty.
Here, again, is silence, reigning undisputed;
the grand path is grassy
with weeds; the little cones drop into
it and are never swept away; the
brown branches of the trees fall upon
it in autumn, and remain there till
they decay into the soil; the water
is stagnant, and the artificial rock-work
in the centre of the pond is
neglected and overgrown with crops
of worthless yet not unlovely weeds.
A landscape gardener would form
and draw out a new map of these
<i>mismanaged</i> acres; a painter would
shout for joy at this picturesque
frame for a historical love-scene, and
would transfer the whole to his canvas,
adding only, according to his
fancy, the pale moon silvering the
mysterious trees, or the setting sun,
in its amethyst radiance, throwing
golden arrows through the glorious
openings of the cypress grove.</p>

<p>This villa of Santa Juliana Falconieri
was once let, now many, many
years ago, to an Englishman, a recent
convert, and a well-known and
zealous defender of his newly adopted
faith. He was not unfrequently
a guest at the neighboring monastery
of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Camaldoli</i>, a beautiful hermitage
embosomed in the woods, and where
the white-robed monks follow a
strict and ascetic rule, very different
from the lives of hypocritical holiness
that Protestants and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">liberators</i> would
make us believe is the present type
of monastic perfection. One day,
when the temporary owner of the
Villa Falconieri was dining at the
Camaldolese convent, the Holy Father,
whose summer residence is close
by, at a little village called Castel
Gandolfo, overlooking the classic
Lake Nemi, came with his retinue to
visit the monks. He also stayed to
dinner, which in Italy and among
religious is in the middle of the day,
and, the visit over, he spontaneously
proposed to his English friend to make
another halt at his house. A message
was sent down in haste to prepare
the villa, and so few were the
servants there that it was not before
the cavalcade of the Pope was at the
head of the cypress alley that the
end nearest the house was swept and
cleaned. The wife and little daughter
were ready to welcome the Holy
Father, as his host introduced him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">[744]</a></span>
into the pretty, picturesque dwelling.
A throne had been temporarily arranged
at the further end of the drawing-room,
and a square of gold-edged
velvet placed at the feet. The "Noble
Guard," part of the Pontifical retinue,
took their places around the
room, seemingly a living wall, and
other ecclesiastical attendants grouped
themselves in various corners.
This was an honor seldom bestowed
on any but Roman princes, and then
very sparingly, so that it was all the
more a distinguished mark of personal
friendship on the part of the good
and fatherly Pope toward his English
child. Not long before, those
three, the father and mother and little
daughter, had knelt before the
Pope, and the parents had resolved
and promised to embrace outwardly
the religion they inwardly believed;
the child had unknowingly played
with its father's sword, and prattled,
as unconscious little ones do, in the
midst of these grave events.</p>

<p>Now, the child was not forgotten
either, and the Holy Father kept it
near his throne, and bestowed especial
attention upon it, even while he
conversed with the steadfast and
happy parents. By-and-by, the Noble
Guard were dismissed, and bivouacked
outside the house, under the
chestnut-trees, till it was dark. Then
lanterns were hung on the branches
and on the tall gates, and a regular
illumination took place. When the
Pope left, torches were carried
around him and his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cortége</i>, all
through the woods that cover the
ground between Frascati and Castel
Gandolfo. A tablet was put up in
the vestibule or <i>atrium</i> of the villa,
with the permission of the owner of
the property, in commemoration of
this signal honor conferred upon a
stranger. These details are only a
part of the many-sided recollections
of this day, but, such as they are, they
come from the lips of an eye-witness,
and we are not conscious that they
are in any degree exaggerated.</p>

<p>Nearly twelve years after this memorable
visit, the villa was revisited
by some of the persons who had
been its temporary occupants during
that occurrence, and it was found to
be in exactly the same state as before;
the dark cypress alley and the
quadrangle, the chestnut-shaded lawn
and deserted-looking house, showing
no sign of the lapse of time. The
former owner, however&mdash;a Cardinal
Falconieri, I believe&mdash;was dead, and
the property was disputed by two
or three noble families. The chapel
of Santa Juliana stood open to the
terrace, accessible from the outside as
well as from the narrow inner passage
connecting it with the house; and on
one side of its tiny walls was the picture
of the saint's death-bed, representing
the miraculous communion
by way of viaticum, when the blessed
sacrament sank into her breast
because her sickness was of such a
nature as to prevent her from receiving
it into her mouth. Below the
picture is a long explanation of this
fact, and a sort of laudatory epitaph
in the saint's honor.</p>

<p>The villa Aldobrandini occupies
one of the most prominent positions
in Frascati, and commands attention
from its tiers of stone fountains, raised
amphitheatre-like one over the other
up the face of the hill, and arranged
so as to let an artificial waterfall
spring down the giant staircase.</p>

<p>Another notable building of this
village is the white-walled Capuchin
convent, a nest among the
trees and rocks, where the little
chapel is railed off by heavy gates
from the poor vestibule, and where
lived once a very good and eloquent
monk, Padre Silvestro. He too, like
the old cardinal, died within the years
that followed the visit of the Pope to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">[745]</a></span>
the Villa Falconieri, but his kindness
to little children and his well-known
powers of language alike
cause him to live for ever in the heart
and memory of those whose happiness
it was to know him.</p>

<p>He always seemed to the writer
the very type of Manzoni's renowned
"Padre Cristofaro," one of the noblest
creatures of that author's world-famed
romance, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">I Promessi Sposi</i>.</p>

<p>And with this mention of him and
his quiet convent&mdash;which is now, perhaps,
a desecrated stable or barrack&mdash;let
us close this little sketch of a
well-remembered and beloved spot,
endeared to us by many happy
hours spent among its hills and woods,
and by the memory of one of God's
best and purest creatures, one worthy
of more gratitude, more love, and
more appreciation than our poor
heart was ever able to render her.
To her, once our guide on earth,
now our guardian, we trust, in heaven,
do we dedicate these few mementoes
of our happy companionship
in a land whose beauty she always
taught us to look upon as the
chosen appanage of the Vicar of
Christ, and the Jerusalem of the new
law.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE OF YORKE.</h2>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.<br />

POLEMICS AND THE WEATHER.</h3>

<p>It is trite to say that error is most
dangerous when mingled with truth;
but never was this saying more applicable
than in the case of the Native
American or Know-Nothing party.
"America for Americans" was not
all a cry of bigotry and exclusion:
the hospitality and freedom of the
nation had been abused, and a reform
was needed. But, unfortunately, it
was possible to make the question a
religious one. The fact that the
greater part of the crime in cities is
committed by foreigners, and that the
majority of foreigners in the country
are at least nominally Catholic, could
easily, by a lame syllogism, be turned
against the church. But what
matter how lame the syllogism, when
prejudice props it on the one side
and malice on the other?</p>

<p>Beside this, the masses of any people
crave an occasional popular commotion
to vary the monotony of
a peaceful national existence, and
nothing else offered at the time.
The advent of this party was, therefore,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i>.</p>

<p>How it used its power, we all
know. It was, indeed, less a party
than an army, for its measures were
violent, invasive, and illegal. Its
street-preachers, from Gavazzi downward,
its pulpit-preachers, who countenanced
their brethren of the mob
by more decent but not less malicious
attacks, its floods of foul literature
penetrating to every nook and
corner of the land, duping and inflaming
the ignorant while it filled the
pockets of irresponsible writers, editors,
and publishers&mdash;the "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canaille de
la littérature</i>," as Voltaire called such&mdash;its
mobs and riots, its churches destroyed
and clergymen maltreated,
its committee of Massachusetts legislators,
senators, and volunteers invading
and insulting a community
of defenceless women, all are matter
of history. The spectacle was a
strange and revolting one, and it was
one which the country is not likely
to see repeated with the same results;
for it is incredible that American
Catholics would ever again submit
to such a persecution. It is
more probable that, should we once
more find our liberties threatened
and our sacred places desecrated,
there will be</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Thirty thousand Cornish men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the reason why."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In this movement, the ambitious
town of Seaton was not to be left
behind; but certain circumstances
conspired to check for a while any
great demonstration. The utter
peacefulness of Father Rasle, and the
undeniably good influence he exercised
over his flock, gave no pretext
for overt attack, and the fact that
he was prospering and had built a
church could only be cited as dangerous
indications. Besides, Edith
Yorke was, quite unconsciously, a
shield to the church in her native
town. Her uncle's family assumed
steadily that no person who hoped
for any countenance from them would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">[747]</a></span>
say or do anything offensive to her.
This assumption on the part of Mr.
and Mrs. Yorke would not have had
so much effect, but their children
were more powerful. Carl was the
idol and hero of the young ladies of
the town, and not for worlds would
one of them have seen directed to
her that flashing gaze with which he
regarded any person who even remotely
reflected on his "cousin
Edith." It did not take much to
freeze that beautiful, laughing face
of his when Edith was in question.
Melicent also had a fair, and Clara
a large, share of the gallantry of the
town, and the former could disconcert
by her haughtiness, the latter
scathe by her passion, any offender
against the family dignity. Major
Cleaveland was also a powerful ally.
Edith was to him an object of romantic
admiration. He insisted that
she ought to have a title, and used
playfully to call her Milady and the
Little Countess, and to say that,
though he did not like the Catholic
religion for himself or his family, he
liked it for her.</p>

<p>"I naturally associate the thought
of her," he said, "with incense, and
lighted altars, and dim, rich aisles."
And he quoted:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Why, a stranger, when he sees her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the street even, smileth stilly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as you would at a lily.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"And should any artist paint her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would paint her, unaware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a halo round her hair."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Evidently, Major Cleaveland would
not countenance anything likely to
insult the dignity or hurt the feelings
of this "radiant maiden"; and Major
Cleaveland's countenance was
of consequence in the town of Seaton.</p>

<p>Edith and Edith's religion had yet
another protector in Mr. Griffeth.
This gentleman was by far the most
popular minister in town, and drew
to himself all the explosive elements
there. His manner of speaking was
lively and theatrical, the matter
amusing. Those progressive spirits
found it delightful to have a pastor
who, when he did condescend to
draw from the Bible, took piquant
texts, such as, <i>Ephraim is as a cake
that is half-baked</i>. It provoked a
smile, and that was what they wanted.
Mr. George MacDonald had not
then been heard of; but Mr. Griffeth
already amused his hearers by holding
up for their derision "old granny
judgment."</p>

<p>"Do not believe," he said, "that
God gives all the pain, and the devil
all the pleasure. Indeed, I do not
insist on your believing that there is
any devil whatever."</p>

<p>All this was charming to his hearers,
so charming that they did not
absolutely require him to abuse Catholicism.
Once only a member of
his congregation gave him a hint on
the subject, but the minister's answer
was ready:</p>

<p>"I do not like to say the same
things which everybody else is saying.
If you wish to hear anti-Catholic
sermons, go to Brothers Martin
and Conway: they will satisfy you.
I do not suppose that my silence on
the subject will be interpreted as a
leaning toward the Church of Rome."</p>

<p>"No, sir!" the gentleman answered
dryly. "It is more likely to be
looked on as a leaning toward the
house of Yorke."</p>

<p>Mr. Griffeth colored, but did not
deny the "soft impeachment." It
would have been useless to deny it,
for his partiality to the family was
evident, though to which member
of it his especial regard was directed,
was not so easy to say. Well for
him that it was not, or he would not,
perhaps, have been forgiven.</p>

<p>So Edith stood, surrounded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">[748]</a></span>
guard of devoted hearts, between the
church and harm.</p>

<p>The physical and mental growth
of this girl was fair to see. It was
like the slow, sweet unfolding of a
rose from the bud, with its baby lip
pushed through the green to the rich
and gracious beauty of the bursting
flower. That morning look which belongs
to the eyes of ingenuous youth
still shed its calm, clear lustre over
hers; her hair had darkened in tint, so
as to be no longer a shadowed gold,
but a gilded shadow; and she shot
up like a young palm-tree, slender,
but with the rounded, vigorous
strength of an Atalanta. She had
that perfect health which makes
mere existence a delight, and she
was perfectly happy, for all her wants
were satisfied, and all her wishes
were winged with hope. Friends
she took as a matter of course. She
did not think much about them, but
loved them quietly, as people do
who never wanted for friends. It is
need or the fear of losing which
develops intensity of affection.</p>

<p>What she did think of was: How
does the wind blow and the sun
shine? What are the names of those
worlds in the sky, and how do they
move? How does the seed sprout
and grow, and what makes the flower
unfold? Where do the birds go
when they disappear in winter, and
how do they know when to return?
How does the snow-flake gather
itself into a star-shape, and what
shapes and colors the rainbow?</p>

<p>Her interest took in also another
subject kindred to these: What distant
people live on the earth? What
do their eyes see? How do they live?
How do they speak? Her mother's
native land having been far away,
made all far-away lands seem fair to
her; and customs and speech different
from those she had known did
not repel, but attracted.</p>

<p>By some happy providence in her
nature or her education, or in both,
the girl's curiosity and love of the
marvellous and beautiful took this
direction, and therefore her delights
did not wither like weeds when childhood
passed: they grew for ever.</p>

<p>But what was best in Edith
Yorke's growth was that she began
to perceive the glories of the church
of God, and, as her knowledge touched
here and there at remote points,
to guess at the grandeur, the symmetry,
and the perfect finish of the
whole structure. She had been ashamed
of her religion, even while she
clung to it, because all the professors
of it whom she knew were poor and
ignorant, and because she had seen
it mocked by a higher class. She
soon learned that all Catholics were
not like those she saw, and that some
of the noblest of earth, persons excelling
in rank, wealth, learning, and
virtue, had been devoted children of
the church. It was a mean reason
for being better satisfied with it, but
it was better than no reason, and it
led upward. What was it that these
people found to love and reverence?
She looked to see, and, seeing, she
also loved and reverenced, not because
the great did, not because any
one else did, but because what she
saw was worthy of such homage.
Once attaining this elevation, it was
easy for a nature like hers to be entirely
and enthusiastically on the side
of God, and to find a beauty and
delight in the fact that had before
repelled her, to rejoice that the poor
and the ignorant, as well as the rich
and the learned, had a place in the
arms of this bountiful Mother, and
that, while human science built a laborious
track on which to crawl toward
the heart of God, simple human
love flew straight there, as the bird
flies to its nest.</p>

<p>Father Rasle instructed her thoroughly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">[749]</a></span>
particularly in controversy.
She must be able not only to defend
herself when attacked, but to attack,
if necessary. As yet, of either attack
or defence she had had no need
to think. That there was strife in
the world, she almost forgot. The
memory of all that had been miserable
in her past life became as a
dream, or was only real enough to
keep fresh her love and gratitude toward
her early friends, and to bar all
intercourse between her and the village
people. She saw them only
when they came to her uncle's house.</p>

<p>Her life was simple&mdash;books, music,
and drawing, a little gardening, and
a good deal of riding on horseback.
Major Cleaveland had given her a
beautiful saddle-horse, and Carl was
her teacher and constant companion
in these rides. Mrs. Yorke, gentle
soul! would have fainted with terror
had she seen the reckless manner in
which these two flew over the ground
when they were out of her sight.</p>

<p>"You have had no exercise till
your cheeks grow red," Carl would
say; and at that challenge Edith
would chirrup to her prancing Thistledown,
and they were off on the
wings of the wind. Thus cloistered
and fostered, she grew up strong,
sweet, and happy, and with the glance
of her clear eyes kept back yet a
while many a shaft that would have
been aimed at the church.</p>

<p>One marksman, however, was not
dazzled by her. Mr. Conway cried
aloud, sparing not. Denunciation
was this man's forte, and he improved
the occasion. It was about this time
that Miss Clara Yorke commented
on the astringent qualities of the gentleman's
character.</p>

<p>"Why, mamma," Hester Cleaveland
said, "he had even the impudence
to come to my house, and exhort
me, and to say that we were all
in danger from the influence of Father
Rasle and Edith. I got up at
that, and said that, since he had taken
the liberty to speak to me in such
a manner of my own family, I should
not scruple to excuse myself from
any further conversation with him
then or in future. And I made him
one of my most splendid bows, and
left him alone; didn't I, you beautiful
creature?"</p>

<p>This question was addressed to a
lovely, gray-eyed infant that lay in
the speaker's lap, and was followed
by a long and interesting conversation
between the two, the young mother
furnishing both questions and
answers, and in that delightful intercourse
quite forgetting Mr. Conway
and his impudence. What were all
the crabbed old ministers in the world
in comparison to mamma's own baby?
Nothing at all! "Come, Melicent,
and see how intelligent his
expression is when I speak to him.
He looks right in my face."</p>

<p>"I do not see how he could well
help it, if he looks anywhere, since
your face is within an inch of his
nose," remarks Melicent dryly.</p>

<p>Hester had at this time been a
year married, and was triumphantly,
we must own, a little selfishly happy.
There was not in her nature a particle
of malice, but she lacked that
sensitive and delicate regard for the
feelings of others less favored than
herself, which makes unselfish persons
cautious not to display too
much their own superior advantages.
As her father had predicted, Major
Cleaveland was to her the most wonderful
man in the world, and as to
Major Cleaveland's youngest son,
words could not express his perfections.
Their house was, in some occult
way, finer than any other house
whatever, their furniture had a charm
of its own, their horses had peculiar
qualities which rendered them more
valuable than you would think, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">[750]</a></span>
very bread and butter had an uncommon
flavor which distinguished
it from the bread and butter of less
fortunate mortals.</p>

<p>The Cleavelands remained in Seaton
the first winter after this baby's
birth, greatly to the joy of Hester's
family. The winters passed rather
heavily for them, and it was a pleasant
break in their daily life to see
Hester's horses turn into the avenue,
with a great jingling of sleigh-bells,
and Hester's pretty face smiling out
from her furs behind them. Even
Clara, absorbed as she was in the
glorious work of putting the last
finishing touches to her first novel&mdash;a
novel actually accepted by
a publisher, and to be brought out
in the spring&mdash;even this inspired
person would start up at that cheery
sound, and run down-stairs to chat
with her sister, and embrace her nephew,
if he were of the party.</p>

<p>But there were times when no one
could come to them, and they could
not go out, but were as close prisoners
as though walls of stone had
been built up around them. One
might as well have been in the Bastile
as in a solitary country-house in
one of those old-fashioned, down-east
snow-storms. One could see them
gather on winter days in a steady
purple bank about the horizon, waiting
there with leaden patience for a
day or two, perhaps, till all their
forces should come up, or till the air
should moderate enough for a fall.
There would be no visible clouds,
but a gradual thickening of the air,
the blue losing its brilliancy under
the gray film, a flake sidling down
now and then in so reluctant a manner
that it seemed every moment on
the point of going up again. Another
follows, and another, they coquette
with the earth, seem to talk the
matter over in the air, finally, with a
good deal of hesitation, one after
another settles, and presently the
storm comes on steadily, and what
was a fairy star of whiteness becomes
a thin white veil, then an inch-deep
of swan's-down, then a pile that
clogs the feet of men and beasts,
and the wheels or runners of carriages,
then an alabaster prison.</p>

<p>It is possible to be in a state of
desolation under such circumstances,
and it is possible not to be: that depends
on the people, and on the
mood they are in. Some groan over
the trial; some, scarcely less agreeable,
sit down and endure it with a
most depressing patience; some shut
the world out, and invent expedients
to forget what sort of world it is;
others, wider of mind and heart and
clearer of sight, take the storm as it
comes, and see all the enchantment
of it. In that vast lily-flower that
has curled down over them, and
shut them in for a time, they find a
honey that sparkles like wine. Lean
out and catch a flake as it falls; it is
a star, a flower, a fairy dumb-bell, a
cross, a globe, always a wonder.
Think, then, of the lavish millions of
them!</p>

<p>One whom nature holds close to
her heart has sung the snow-storm:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"Every pine, and fir, and hemlock,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wore ermine too dear for an earl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the poorest twig on the elm-tree<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was ridged inch-deep with pearl."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>One such snow in Seaton fell all
day quietly, and all night, with a
rising wind, and the next morning
they woke in chaos. There was no
up and down out of doors, but only
a roundabout. There was a whirl,
and a whiteness that dimmed off into
grayness; there were no fences nor
posts; a ghost of a pyramid stood
where the barn had been; what had
been trees were white giants coming
toward them, apparently. They opened
their windows to brush away
the snow that piled up on the sill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">[751]</a></span>
and were blinded and baffled; they
opened their doors to go out, and a
solid Parian barrier was laid across
the step, knee-high; they tried to
shovel a path, and an angry wind
and a myriad of little hands filled it
in again. Patrick and Carl made a
desperate effort to reach the village,
and, after struggling as far as the
avenue gate, were glad to get back
to the house without being suffocated.
At the door they found Edith catching
snow-flakes to look at the shapes
of them, and watching with wonder
and delight certain thin, sharp drifts
that a breath would have shaken
from their airy poise, but which the
wild wind never stirred even to a
tremor.</p>

<p>"If one could only see the shapes
of the wind!" she said. "Or is it,
Carl, that the shape of the snow is
the shape of the wind?"</p>

<p>Clara shook the snow from her
brother's coat, and slyly dropped a
snow-ball down his back; even Melicent
forgot her dignity so far as to
sit down in a bank, which enthroned
her very prettily. Carl thereupon
called her Mrs. Odin, and Melicent
smiled involuntarily at the idea of
being Mrs. Anybody. The mother
and father, standing side by side,
watched them smilingly from the
window, and remembered how they
used to play in the snow when they
were children, and felt young again
for a brief moment.</p>

<p>"But the spectres of rheumatism
and sore-throat stand between me
and all that folderol now," Mr.
Yorke says, with a half-sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; but it is pretty to look
at," says the wife cheerfully. "And
we elders have the fire, which is
more beautiful yet."</p>

<p>They pile wood on the fire. It
blazes up, and reddens all the dusky
room, and presently Mrs. Yorke
wraps a scarlet mantle about her,
and goes, with a little shiver, almost
to the door, and calls out in the
sweetest little bird-call: "Come in,
children, come in! You'll take cold."</p>

<p>"Mother looks and sounds like an
oriole in there," says Carl. "Come,
girls!"</p>

<p>They all come in with very red
cheeks and bright eyes, Edith running
to show her aunt a large star-flake
before it melts. Mrs. Yorke,
bending to examine it, breathes on
it, and it changes instantly to a spot
of water on Edith's dark-blue sleeve.</p>

<p>The two young Pattens, who have
developed into clever scapegraces, are
pushing each other into drifts at the
back-door, and pretending not to
hear Betsey's stern calls to them to
come to their work. When she appears
at the door with her hands all
ready to administer summary chastisement,
they elude her with the skill
of practised gymnasts or of children
used to dodging blows, run under her
very elbows into the kitchen, and are
busily and gravely employed by the
time she has turned about and come
back. Patrick sets his face resolutely
toward the barn, where are certain
quadrupeds to be cared for, and
flounders as if he were himself a
quadruped, and becomes a lessening
speck, only the head visible, and
finally, when they begin to think that
he is lost, triumphantly pushes the
barn-door open, and is greeted by
a neigh from the horse, a shake of
the head from the cow, and a welcoming
cackle from the hens.</p>

<p>That evening they had music.
Melicent played brilliantly, and Clara
sang them an elfish old song:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"'Wha patters sae late at our gyle-window?'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Mither, it's the cauld sleet.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Come in, come in,' quoth the canny gude-wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'An' warm thae frozen feet.'"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When it came time for prayers,
Mr. Yorke read that exquisite chapter
in Job wherein God speaks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">[752]</a></span>
the incomprehensible mysteries of
power and wisdom hidden in the
things that he has made.</p>

<p>Carl, finding himself bored, leaned
back in his chair, and clasped his
hands over the top of his head. The
leaning back brought within his
range of vision the fold of a dark-blue
gown, the toe of a small shoe,
and a pair of lovely folded hands.
He turned his face a little, and looked
at Edith, who had drawn her
chair near his, and as he looked his
face softened, and he unconsciously
changed his careless position to one
more respectful. He saw her profile,
with the lustrous eyes steady as
she listened, and so uplifted as to show
their full size. The firelight played
over her quiet face, and made shine
a curve or two of the large braid of
hair wound round her head.</p>

<p>When Mr. Yorke read: <i>Hast thou
entered into the store-houses of the
snow, or hast thou beheld the treasures
of the hail?</i> etc., she glanced at Carl,
and smiled. She had known that
he was looking at her, and was pleased
that he should. Carl had a particularly
pleasant way of looking at
his cousin which she felt as a flower
may feel the sun. It was as though
they were talking together without
words, and he knew her thoughts
without the trouble of speech.</p>

<p>When the reading was over, Edith
said good-night to each one, kissed
her aunt on both cheeks, and went
up to her chamber. The last good-night
was to Carl, who opened the
door for her.</p>

<p>"He has beautiful manners," she
said to herself as she went up-stairs.
"He says so much without speaking
a word. He seemed to say good-night,
but he did not speak. I think
that, when we go to heaven, we shall
all talk in that silent way. How
odd that Carl and I should begin
now!"</p>

<p>She wrapped a shawl about her,
and stood before her crucifix, looking
at it, and recollecting herself before
saying her prayers. "When I am
going to speak to Carl or to Dick,
or to any one, I think of him. If I
were going to speak to a king, I
should think of nothing else, and my
heart would beat quickly. I am
going to speak to the One who makes
kings."</p>

<p>She bowed her head with a calm
reverence. But that was not what she
wanted. Her heart craved emotion.
"I am going to speak to the Son of
God. He was poor, he was despised
and rejected. When I was the
poorest, I had my little attic to sleep
in, but he had not where to lay his
head. O dear Lord! it was pitiful.
I will never, never turn you out in
the cold!"</p>

<p>When Melicent softly entered her
room, next to Edith's, and stopped a
moment, hesitating whether to speak
to her cousin, she heard her breathe out
as she laid her head upon the pillow,
"In the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ, I lie down to sleep!"</p>

<p>Melicent stole noiselessly away
from the door. She could not address
any trivial word, even any
word of common affection, to one
who had just lain down to sleep
in the name of the Lord Jesus
Christ. It made sleep seem awful
and sacred as well as sweet. It
made guardian angels seem possible,
even necessary. "How beautiful
the Catholic religion is in some of its
forms!" she thought, and, after a
moment, knelt, and said a short prayer
that she also might be guarded during
the night, and that the Lord
would not refuse to let her also rest
in his name. She felt a sense of
safety in having her cousin near, and
the door of Edith's chamber seemed
to her like the door of a shrine.</p>

<p>The next morning when they waked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753">[753]</a></span>
the windows were all of a glitter
with sunshine, and wrought over by
the artisans of frostland with samples
of every landscape under the sun&mdash;cliffs
with climbing spruce-trees, silvery-sanded
deserts with palms, an
infinite variety. The sky was a dazzling
clearness. The earth was like a
stormy sea that had suddenly been
enchanted into a motionless and ineffable
whiteness; the wave curled
over, with the spray all ready to
slide down its back; the hollows were
arrested in their sinking, the ripples
frozen in their dimpling.</p>

<p>Then when evening came there
was a grand display of northern lights,
that pitched their tents of shifting
rose and gold, with flags flying, and
armies marching, and stained the
snow with airy blood.</p>

<p>Carl stood in the cupola with
Edith and Clara clinging to him,
both a little uneasy, and told them
stories of Thor, Odin, the Bifrost
bridge, and Valhalla. What they saw
was the Scandinavian gods carousing,
he said; or, no, it was a repetition
of that fierce battle of olden time,
when, at night, spectators saw the
dead arise from the field, float up
into the air, and fight their battle
over again in the sky, that wild legend
that Kaulbach painted on canvas.</p>

<p>"Carl," Edith said hesitatingly,
"I think that the truth is more beautiful
than any legend."</p>

<p>"But we do not know the truth
about northern lights," he replied,
taking a scientific view of the matter.</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment. She
was not used to speaking of what
came nearest to her heart. But Father
Rasle had given her a charge:
"Whenever you have a chance to
say anything beautiful about God, say
it. That is your duty."</p>

<p>"We know that God made them,"
she faltered.</p>

<p>"Oh! that spoils the poetry of it!"
Carl exclaimed involuntarily. "Pardon
me! but to speak of God is to
remind me of long, sanctimonious
faces and disagreeable ways, and of
a frowning on everything graceful
and grand and beautiful."</p>

<p>"It isn't right!" she said eagerly,
forgetting herself; "for it is God who
has made everything grand and beautiful
and graceful. When you see a
fine picture, or a piece of statuary, or
read a good book, you think of the artist,
and admire him. Reading a play,
the other day, you said, 'What a soul
Shakespeare had!' and I heard you
say once that Michael Angelo was a
god; and last night, when Melicent
played a sonata you liked, you exclaimed,
'That glorious Beethoven!'
Why not say, 'That great God!' when
you see the northern lights? Besides,
God made Beethoven, and
Michael Angelo, and Shakespeare, and
taught them everything they knew.
I do really think, Carl, that the truth
is more beautiful than any legend.
Why isn't it as fine to say, '<i>The God of
glory thundereth</i>,' as to talk about Jove
throwing thunderbolts? I don't see
anything very admirable in Jove.
And why isn't it as sublime for the
sun to hang and shine, and the world
to go whirling about it, because God
told them to, as for Phœbus to drive
the chariot of the sun up the East?"</p>

<p>She turned her face, rosy with earnestness
and northern lights, and
looked at him with her shining eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, Edith," he said, "you're
going to be a poet!"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and hung it a
little bashfully. "No, I am not. But
King David was a poet."</p>

<p>And so the matter dropped. But
Edith had spoken her word for God,
and may be it had not been entirely
lost.</p>

<p>Perhaps we may be allowed here
to say a word in defence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">[754]</a></span>
weather as a subject of conversation.
The assertion that Americans, and
especially New Englanders, commence
all acquaintanceships and all
social conversations with an atmospheric
exordium, has become classical,
and to mention that on any
given occasion the weather was the
subject of conversation is to intend
to be facetious. But let us question
the good sense of this mockery. Are
not the countless phases of the many-sided
weather as noble, as beautiful,
as profitable, and as harmless topics
of conversation as ninety-nine out of
a hundred things which people do
talk about? Is a dull or a wicked
speech, a dull or a wicked book, a
fashion, a horse, your neighbor's
character, a caucus, a candidate, even
a song, or a bit of weather on canvas,
a finer topic?</p>

<p>Ah, the weather!&mdash;skies of infinite
changes, inexhaustible palette in
which the painter's imagination dips
its brush; calms, nature holding her
breath; winds, the nearest to spirit
of any created thing; clouds, the
aerial chemists of light; showers,
overflowing spray from fountains suspended
in air; rains, the asperges of
the skies; fogs, filmy veils which all
the king's men cannot tear aside;
droughts, continents in a fever; cold,
the horror of nature, at which the
small streams stiffen and die, the
mountains whiten to ghosts, and
even iron shrinks; heat, nature's
angel of the resurrection blowing
through the golden sunshine, and
calling the flowers out of their graves,
and bringing the birds from afar&mdash;would
that all the bad, the uncharitable,
the silly, the cold, the complaining
talk that on this earth vexes
the ear of heaven could be changed
to sweet and harmless talk of the infinitely-varying
weather, and of him
who planned its variety!</p>

<p>After this protest and aspiration, it
can be said of the Yorkes, without
any intention of reflecting on their
intelligence, that the weather had a
good deal to do with their entertainment,
from the spring round through
the circle of flowers and snows, till
beside the melting drift they found
the first May-flowers making their
rosy act of faith in the coming summer.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XII.<br />

CARL SEES HIMSELF IN A GLASS DARKLY.</h3>

<p>The summer we are thinking of was
1851, and in the June of it Edith had
her sixteenth birthday duly celebrated
by the family, and Clara published
her first book, an event of still
greater consequence to them.</p>

<p>In the June of this year, also, the
Hon. Mr. Blank came down to delight
and instruct the voters of Seaton.
Mr. Yorke was highly pleased by
this announcement. He had known
the gentleman in Boston, and thought
him eloquent. It would be pleasant
to see and hear a man of note once
more. "Come to think of it, Amy,"
he said, "we have been buried here
four years, seeing nobody outside of
the town. It will be truly refreshing.
We must have him here to dinner or
tea, and we must all go to hear the
address. It is to be in a tent on the
fair-grounds."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke was quite bright and
interested. He had been living in
seclusion long enough to appreciate
the value of a little excitement. He
called on Mr. Blank at his hotel,
the evening of his arrival, and had a
very cordial and agreeable half-hour,
talking chiefly of personal matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">[755]</a></span>
and old friends. Two or three other
gentlemen who were paying their respects
to the senator withdrew after
a few minutes, to Mr. Yorke's satisfaction.
They were persons whom he
did not at all like.</p>

<p>"I am worn out," Mr. Blank said,
leaning back in his chair, and poising
his heels on the back of another chair.
"I have made forty speeches in thirty
days. But it pays. The excitement
is immense."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke was rather ashamed to
ask what particular issue created this
excitement and palaver. The truth
was, he was a little behind the times.
His four years had been years of
vegetation, and he scarcely knew what
his old friends were about. He had
been so much engaged in filling up
the maw of his avenues, coaxing exotics
to bloom for the first time in his
gardens, and reading novels&mdash;actually
reading novels&mdash;that he was
politically in the position of a man
who had had a four years' sleep. He
was mortified and astonished to realize
at this moment that he had been
going over the Waverley novels again,
when he should have been reading
the papers and keeping the state of
the nation in view.</p>

<p>His embarrassment was relieved
by a loud shout that rose from a
crowd collected in front of the hotel.
The gentleman for whom this applause
was intended took no notice of
it, except by an impatient shake of
the head. He sipped a little from a
tumbler at his elbow, and calmly
lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>The shouting ceased, and the Seaton
band&mdash;not the cast-iron band
this time&mdash;broke out in their finest
style.</p>

<p>"Confound them!" ejaculated the
senator. "Do they think I want to
hear their noise? I am tired of
Dodworth's and the Germanians;
but this! Why, it's all trombones."</p>

<p>The music ceased, and the shout
went up again.</p>

<p>"They will have me out," groaned
the hero of the hour. "I've a great
mind to be taken sick. Couldn't you
go out and say I'm sick?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," Mr. Yorke said decisively,
"I could not."</p>

<p>"Well, couldn't you go out and
make a speech for me? You're about
my build. It's easy. I could say it
in my sleep. Honored&mdash;free and intelligent
people&mdash;your beautiful town&mdash;glorious
cause, etc. Fill it in as
you like."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke laughed. "I'm about
half your build, and my voice is as
much like yours as a crow's is like a
nightingale's. Go along. When
you've embarked in this sort of thing,
you must take the consequences."</p>

<p>As another and still more imperative
call came up, the honorable
gentleman rose with a yawn, and the
two stepped out into the balcony.</p>

<p>"My dear friends," began the
speaker in silvery-clear tones, "words
fail me to express the feelings which
move my heart when I listen to this
generous welcome." (Applause.)</p>

<p>"Well for you that they do," parenthesized
Mr. Yorke.</p>

<p>"Your approval honors you more
than it does me," resumed the senator.
"For what am I but the mouthpiece
by which you speak, as the
thunder-cloud speaks by the lightning?
The mass of the people
gather the truth, and it is their fire
which informs the leader, and incites
him to utter it forth. They are the&mdash;"
(Immense applause.)</p>

<p>"The idiots!" exclaimed the orator.
"They have broken into my best
paragraph where it can't be mended.
I must wind up."</p>

<p>"The fame of your town has
reached me," he went on. "I have
heard of it as a place where freedom
is not only loved, but adored, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">[756]</a></span>
oppression is not only hated, but
trampled on; and to-day, when I
drove over the distant hills, and saw
the white spires of your churches
rising out of the forests, they seemed
to me like warning fingers pointing
heavenward, as though the genius of
the place bade me remember that
the angelic hosts were witnessing if I
and if you were faithful to the sacred
trust placed in our keeping." (Tempests
of applause).</p>

<p>"That always takes," remarked
the senator to his companion.
"Spires are trumps."</p>

<p>"My friends, to-night I am but a
voice to you, but to-morrow we shall
meet face to face. Let not a man be
missing. Seaton expects every voter
to do his duty. Again I thank you
for your kind welcome, and wish you
one and all good-night."</p>

<p>"What do they think a man is
made of when they call him out to
speak in a fog thick enough to slice
and butter?" grumbled the orator,
getting into his chamber again, and
dropping the curtain between him
and a second burst of music from
the band.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke raised his eyebrows
slightly, and pursed out his under-lip.
"What glorious things have
you heard of Seaton, and where?"
he inquired. "I was not aware that
it was famous."</p>

<p>The senator finished the contents
of his tumbler, and wiped his moustache
carefully. "I have heard that
it is an infernally rowdyish little
hole," he answered. "I didn't care
about coming here, but it was in my
stumping programme."</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke took leave, and went
homeward very soberly. He was
disappointed and depressed, and nature
seemed to sympathize with his
mood. The road was muddy, and
in the thick fog and darkness he
could scarcely see the path at the
side of it. When he turned into the
private way that led to his own
house, the trees crowded about, dripping,
uncomfortable, and threatening,
as if they had met to impeach the
clerk of the weather, and concert
measures for the putting down of this
Scotch mist that was presuming to
befog a free, enlightened New England
forest. When he reached the
gate, Mr. Yorke leaned on it a moment.
"Oh! for the laws of the Locrians!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Charles, is that you?" asked a
soft voice near.</p>

<p>"Why, Amy!" returned the gentleman,
starting.</p>

<p>"I was looking for you," Mrs.
Yorke explained, taking her husband's
arm. "I hate to have you come up
this road alone."</p>

<p>Her thin dress was damp, her
hands cold, her heart fluttering. She
had been walking up and down the
avenue for the last hour, listening for
her husband's step. How did she
know what might happen to him?
The people were violent, and he was
uncompromising and bold. Oh! why
had she consented to return to that
place where her youth had been
blighted? No good had ever come
to her there, nothing but sorrow.</p>

<p>"O woman, woman! how you do
torment yourself!" Mr. Yorke ejaculated.
"You will have it that we
are in danger. You will have it that
we are being hanged, drawn, and
quartered, if we are ten minutes beyond
the time."</p>

<p>"Would you rather we should care
nothing about you?" his wife asked
tremulously.</p>

<p>"No, dear," he answered; "for I
know that your fears are in proportion
to your loving."</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Yorke and his
daughters went to hear the address.
Edith remained at home with her
aunt, who never went into a crowd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">[757]</a></span>
The road, the tent, and all about it
were full of people. The enthusiasm
was immense. When the speaker
appeared, the audience stood up, the
men shouting, the women waving
their handkerchiefs&mdash;what for it would
be hard to say. Probably they did
not know themselves, unless they
meant to express thus their admiration
for success. For this man was
the very embodiment of worldly success.
Wealth and honors had come
to him, not unsought, but without
toil, and with little deserving. Success
showed forth from his smooth,
handsome face with its bright eyes
and ready smile, even from the plump
white hand, at whose wave thousands
of voters said yea or nay. His expression
was one of pleasant excitement
and self-complacency, such as
a man like him may naturally feel in
such circumstances. He was a fluent
speaker, had a musical voice, and a
graceful manner.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke listened to his exordium
with great and anxious interest, and,
as from generalities the orator gradually
became more specific, his face
darkened. It was, in fact, nothing
more than a Know-Nothing tirade,
with the usual appeal to the passions
instead of the reason, and the
old hackneyed abuse of the clergy.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke rose like a tiger. "Come,
girls," he said quite audibly. "I
can't listen to any more of this
trash."</p>

<p>His daughters followed him quietly;
but, their seats being prominent,
they could not get out without exciting
attention, and the first to see
them was the speaker. He faltered
a little in his speech, and a faint color
rose to his face; but he recovered
himself immediately, and waved his
hand to stop the hisses that were beginning
to rise. But he felt the defection.
He knew well that he was
a politician, not a statesman, and he
would rather have had Mr. Yorke's
countenance than that of any ten
other men present.</p>

<p>Mr. Yorke did not dine with the
senator that day as he had promised
to. "When I made the engagement,
I did not know that you had become
a wire-puller," he wrote briefly, in
making his excuse.</p>

<p>Mr. Blank's face paled slightly as
he read the note, but he crushed it
carelessly the moment after. "Charles
Yorke was always a hunker," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Carl, I want you to print a leader
from me, this week," Mr. Yorke
said to his son that evening.</p>

<p>We have not said that Carl, having
finished his law-studies, instead
of practising, had undertaken the
editorship of the Seaton <cite>Herald</cite>.</p>

<p>"I am afraid, sir," the young man
replied, "that, if you print your leaders
in the <cite>Herald</cite>, you will have to
pay the expenses of the paper, and
insure the office against fire and
mobs. At present the circulation is
very small, and I dare not say a
word against the party in power."</p>

<p>This paper was not, indeed, a very
prosperous sheet; for the editor could
not lower himself to the majority of
the people, and they could not raise
themselves to him. His politics were
too little violent, his tone too gentlemanly,
his literary items and extracts
too pure and high in tone.</p>

<p>Major Cleaveland and Hester were
taking tea at the homestead, and,
when after tea Edith went up-stairs
to read a letter she had just received
from Dick Rowan, there was quite
a warm discussion of the events of
the day.</p>

<p>"After all, Mr. Blank is a strong
speaker," Major Cleaveland said.</p>

<p>"A strong speaker!" exclaimed
his father-in-law. "He is rank, sir!"</p>

<p>The ladies interposed a little.</p>

<p>"I'm not a Know-Nothing," Hester's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">[758]</a></span>
husband said; "but neither do
I condemn them. Their charges are
not all false. The Catholic party
proclaim their theory, which is very
fine, and say nothing about the abuses
which creep into their practice;
their enemies denounce the abuses,
and give them no credit for their
principles. I think that the gist of
the trouble is this: neither party will
distinguish between the church and
the clergy. When the body of Catholics
will check their priests the
minute they step out of their province
or abuse their power, and
when non-Catholics learn not to condemn
a religion for the sins of individual
professors, then we shall have
peace."</p>

<p>The ladies and Carl went out into
the garden, and left the two gentlemen
to their discussion.</p>

<p>"I often wonder, Carl, that you
express no opinion on these subjects,"
his mother said. "You must have
opinions. I almost wish, sometimes,
that you would argue."</p>

<p>"Which side do you wish me to
prove?" he inquired listlessly. "I
can prove either."</p>

<p>She sighed. "How you do need
rousing!"</p>

<p>He put his arm around her as they
walked up and down the piazza.
"My opinion is, little mother," he
said, "that opinions are a bore. Who
wants to be always listening to what
other people think on subjects? Not
one thought in a milliard is worth
putting into words. I am sick of
words, of gabble, of inanities."</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," she said gently.
"But one expects a man to give
his opinion once for all on religious
questions."</p>

<p>"It is not a religious question,
mother: it is a question of religions,"
the young man replied with a sort
of impatience. "There is no greater
bore than that same question.
Why does not each person believe
what suits him, and hold his tongue
about it, and let every other do the
same?"</p>

<p>"But truth! but truth!" said the
mother.</p>

<p>Carl shrugged his shoulders. "Everybody
thinks he has it shut up in
his cranium."</p>

<p>"What! you renounce religion?"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Not at all," he said. "They are
so many spiritual gymnasiums where
people exercise their souls. They
are very pretty and amiable for women,
and for men who need them;
but there are those who do not need
them."</p>

<p>"Carl, you break my heart!" his
mother cried out, gazing through
tears into her son's face. The boyish
look had gone out of it. There
were weariness and sadness in it, and
hardness, too.</p>

<p>Carl was in a bitter mood that
day, but he tried to soothe the pain
he had given. "I'll do anything,"
he said laughingly. "I'll turn Catholic.
I'll go to hear John Conway.
I'll read the <cite>Dairyman's Daughter</cite>.
I'll teach a Sunday-school class."</p>

<p>Edith came smiling out through
the door. "Such a nice letter from
Dick!" she said, giving it to her
aunt. "And see, Carl, here is a
little handful of sand from the Sahara,
and here is an orange-blossom
from Sorrento. It looks quite fresh."</p>

<p>Dick Rowan had that delightful
way which so few letter-writing travellers
know of making their descriptions
more vivid by sending some illustrations
of them. Writing from
the south, he would say, "While you
are in the midst of snow, there is a
rose-tree in bloom outside my window.
Here is one of the buds."
He had emancipated himself from
the letter-writers, and succeeded perfectly
in his own way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">[759]</a></span></p>

<p>The next afternoon Mrs. Yorke sent
for Mr. Griffeth, and saw him alone.
"What have you done to Carl?"
she exclaimed. "Are you making an
infidel of him?"</p>

<p>The minister, confounded, tried to
excuse Carl and defend himself.</p>

<p>The interview was not a pleasant
one, and Mr. Griffeth was glad when
it was over. He went out into the
sitting-room where Melicent and
Clara sat; but their constrained manners
did not encourage him to stay
long. They suspected the subject of
the conversation he had been holding
with their mother.</p>

<p>Edith sat on the piazza outside,
studying. Her person was not in
sight as he looked from the window,
but a flutter of drapery on the breeze
betrayed her presence. Mr. Griffeth
merely bowed to the sisters in passing,
and went out on to the piazza. Edith
sat in a low chair with a book of
German ballads on her knees. By
her side were a grammar and dictionary.
She was translating, watching
thought after thought emerge from
that imperfectly-known language, as
stars emerge from the mists of heaven.</p>

<p>She glanced at the minister with a
smile that was less for him than for
the stanza she had just completed.</p>

<p>"Salve!" he exclaimed, bowing
lowly.</p>

<p>"I am translating a song from the
German," Edith said. "Is not translating
delightful? It is like digging
for gold, and finding it. I have just
got a thought out whole."</p>

<p>The song was that beautiful one
which has been rendered:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The fight is done: and, far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The thundering noise of battle dies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While homeward, glad, I wend my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To meet the sunlight of her eyes."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Edith was looking very lovely.
The vines curtaining the end of the
piazza where she sat shut her into a
green nook to which only the finest
sprinkle of sunshine could penetrate.
The light, moving shadows flecked
her white gown, and all the floor of
the piazza about her,</p>

<p class="center">
"Making a quiet image of disquiet,"<br />
</p>

<p>and a flickering in her hair. Carl,
who was always dressing her out in
some fanciful way, had fastened a
drooping bunch of white lilies in her
braids, and the petals, lying against
her neck and cheek, showed the difference
between silver-white and rose-white.
Her beaming face made a
light in the place.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffeth, stooping to see the
poem, laid his hand on the book she
held, and she released it so suddenly
that it had nearly fallen to the floor.</p>

<p>"It is beautiful," he said, reading
it aloud. "Can you not fancy yourself
that golden-haired lady, and that
some warrior is coming home to lay
his honors at your feet and claim his
reward?"</p>

<p>Edith looked away quickly, and
let the air take the brightness of her
face. He gazed steadily at her, and
wondered for whom the brightness
was, or if it were only a girl's vague
romance.</p>

<p>"I like soldiers," she said after a
moment, and, though quiet, there
seemed a slight stateliness in her manner.
"My grandfather was a soldier
all his life, and was as used to a
sword as I am to a fan. Mamma said
that one of his mottoes was, 'Never
reckon the forces of an enemy till
after the victory.' It was written in
one of her letters to papa. If I were
a man, I should wish to be a soldier."</p>

<p>"I also am a soldier; I fight the
devil," the minister said, with a slight,
bitter laugh.</p>

<p>"Do you conquer him?" she asked
simply, but with the faintest little
mocking smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Griffeth ignored the question.
"You have golden hair, like the lady
of the song," he said hastily. "If I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">[760]</a></span>
were a soldier, Edith, and came home
to you from battle, would you welcome
me as that lady did her lover?"
He touched her hair with his hand as
he spoke.</p>

<p>A bright crimson color swept over
her face, and she stood up instantly,
drawing away from him, her eyes
sparkling. Edith Yorke's innocence
was not of that kind which is divorced
from dignity and delicacy, and smiles
at freedoms from everybody.</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" the minister stammered,
and at the same moment,
to complete his discomfiture, perceived
that the curtain to the window
directly behind them had been drawn
aside, and that Mrs. Yorke stood there,
flushed and haughty, with a look in
her eyes which he had never seen
there before.</p>

<p>His case was desperate, he knew,
but he made an effort to recover. "I
forgot myself," he said; "but I assure
you I meant no harm."</p>

<p>"What harm could you have
meant, sir?" said the lady, drawing
herself up.</p>

<p>It was not an easy question to
answer.</p>

<p>"You have probably made the
mistake of supposing that the young
ladies in my family are as free in their
manners as those in some other
families you may know. It is a mistake.
I have taken care that their
education shall second and confirm
what is always the impulse of a refined
nature: to regard such freedoms
as offences when coming from
any one but the one chosen to receive
all favors."</p>

<p>Mr. Griffeth might apologize, and
the apology be civilly received, but,
when he walked away from that
house, he felt that he would not be
welcomed in it again. And so the
church in Seaton lost a friend and
found an enemy. The next Sunday
the most bitter anti-Catholic sermon
of the season was preached from the
Universalist pulpit.</p>

<p>A few weeks after came a peremptory
letter from Miss Clinton. She
wanted Carl to come up to see her.
What was he burying himself in the
country for? Was he raising turnips?
Was he going to marry some
freckled dairy-maid? If he was,
she did not wish to set eyes on him.
What did they mean by leaving her
to die alone, without a relative near
her? It was unnatural! It was a
shame! Let Carl come at once. If
he pleased her, she would provide
for him.</p>

<p>Miss Clinton's promises were not
very trustworthy in this respect, for
she had successively endowed and
disinherited every one of her relatives
and friends. But that was no
reason why her request should be refused.
She was a lonely old woman,
and Carl must go to her.</p>

<p>He consented rather reluctantly,
protesting that he would only stay a
week. But, when he got there, it
was not so easy to tear himself away.</p>

<p>"A newspaper to edit?" cried the
old lady. "What signifies a newspaper
in a little country town? Nobody
ever reads it."</p>

<p>"Not when <em>I</em> edit it?" says Carl
with a laugh. He found the old lady
amusing.</p>

<p>"No, not even then, Master Vanity,"
she replies. "Stay here, Carl.
It is miserable to be left alone so.
I sha'n't keep you very long. You
shall have any room you choose,
and money enough to be respectable,
and you may smoke from morning
to night. There is only one thing
you may not do. I won't have a dog
in this house, for two reasons: he
might go mad, and he might worry
my cat. Will you stay? Old people
live longer when they have young
ones about them; and, besides, I'm
lonely. Bird torments me. She hints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">[761]</a></span>
religion, and reads the Bible when
she thinks I don't see her. I know
she is searching out texts that she
thinks will fit my case. I am getting
old, Carl, and I forget a little the arguments
against all this superstition.
They are true, but I forget them;
and sometimes in the night, or when
I feel nervous, the nonsensical religious
stories I have heard come up
and frighten me, and I have nothing
to oppose to them. Alice torments
me, too. She is so sure, she <em>looks</em> so
much, she goes about with her religion
just like a little child holding its mother's
hand, while I am sure of nothing,
and have nothing to lean on but
this stick"&mdash;holding out a cane in
her shaking hand.</p>

<p>"It must be comfortable to believe
so," she went on, after two or three
gasping breaths. "I envy the fools
who can. But I can't. My head is
too clear for that. And I want you
here, Carl, to remind me of the arguments
that I forget, and to talk to
me when I am nervous. They tell
me that you are a free-thinker, and I
know that you are clever. Stay, for
God's sake! I suppose there may
be a God."</p>

<p>Carl shrank from the wild appeal
in that frightened old face; shrank
yet more from the horrible task assigned
him. Unbelief, as he had
contemplated it, looked gallant, noble,
and aspiring; but this unbelief
seemed like a glimpse into that perdition
which he had denied. In this
old scoffer he felt as if contemplating
a distorted image of himself. It was
as if he had been asked to commit a
crime, a sacrilege. There was such
a crime as sacrilege, he saw.</p>

<p>But he could not refuse to stay.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it would be better for
us both to look for arguments
against than for our theories," he
said gravely.</p>

<p>Anything, so that he did not leave
her, she insisted. Indeed, she wanted
his masculine strength more than
anything else. Every one about feared
her, or was tenderly careful of her,
but this young man had already more
than once good-naturedly scouted
her notions. He was one to be fearless
and tell the truth, and she felt
safe with him. Besides, he was a
man, and clever, and it would not
hurt her pride to be influenced by
him. If her insensible and selfish
heart felt no longer the necessity of
loving, it still felt the equally feminine
necessity of submission and sacrifice.
Already in the bottom of
her heart was a faint hope that Carl
might insist on having a dog in the
house, and that she might show her
dawning fondness for him by consenting&mdash;a
greater concession than
she had ever yet made in her life.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

A RIVAL FOR EDITH.</h3>

<p>Dick Rowan came home in the
spring of '52 to begin a new life. In
the first place, he was to have
a ship of his own. Mr. Williams
had a beautiful ship almost ready to
launch, and he was to be the master
of it. He was to name it, too, that
had been promised him; but what
name he meant to bestow was as yet
a secret to all but himself. What
could it be but the <i>Edith Yorke</i>?
He had other matters to settle, too;
he must become a Catholic. He
had promised Edith that he would,
if, on reading, he found he could do
so conscientiously. He had read a
good deal, more than he liked, indeed,
and saw nothing to object to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">[762]</a></span>
Besides, the fact that it was Edith's
religion and the religion of his father's
boyhood was a strong argument
in its favor. There was one other
affair to settle, the thought of which
made the color drop out of his
cheeks, and his heart rise in excited
throbs. He had studied it over and
over during this last voyage, and his
mind was made up. Edith was almost
seventeen years old, and he
meant to speak to her. She must
know now, if she ever would, whether
she was willing to be his wife.</p>

<p>Perhaps something said to him by
Captain Cary had hastened his decision.
The captain had seen what
his studies were, and been vexed by
them.</p>

<p>"You are going too far, Dick,"
he expostulated. "A man never
should change his religion for a girl's
sake. She won't like you any the
better for it. Besides, Dick, I can't
help saying it, you are making a fool
of yourself. She will marry Carl
Yorke."</p>

<p>Dick stared, reddened, then grew
pale. "I think not," he said decidedly.
"Don't say that again, captain."</p>

<p>The first thing to be attended to,
then, was his religion. He must be
a Catholic when he met Edith. Besides,
if religion gives strength, he
would feel better prepared to put his
fortune to the test. He went, therefore,
to a clergyman immediately.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to read any more,
sir," he said. "I do not like the
way in which learned men prove
their arguments to be true. It is too
ingenious. It always seems to me
that the other side could be just as
well proved, if one were clever
enough. I am willing to believe
whatever is true. I cannot swear to
any doctrine, except the existence of
a God and the divinity of Christ.
Those two truths I would stand by
with my life. For the rest, I can
only say that I place my mind and
heart passively in the hands of God,
and ask him to direct them. I can
do no more, except to say that, if I
do not believe, neither do I disbelieve
anything that has been proposed
to me. Perhaps my head isn't
a very good one; I dare say it is not.
I certainly do not like subtleties. It
seems to me that all necessary truth
may be known and believed by a
very ordinary intellect with very moderate
study. What I want in religion
is what I find in the faces of
some of the poor people whom I
see here at Mass in the early morning,
and I don't believe they got
that out of books, or got it themselves
in any way."</p>

<p>"You are right," the priest said.
"What you saw in their faces was
faith, a pure gift of God. But you
believe baptism to be necessary to
salvation?"</p>

<p>"I am inclined to think so, but
not sure," was the reply. "If I were
sure, then I should already have
faith, which is what I come to ask
for. If it is necessary, I wish for it."</p>

<p>The priest mused. This was not
a very fervent penitent certainly;
but he was a sincere one, and in his
fine, earnest face the father read a
latent fervor and power of strong
conviction which would be all the
more precious when aroused.</p>

<p>Dick mistook the father's silence
for hesitation, and his real impatience
broke out. "I am uneasy, sir," he
said; "I wish to be one thing or another."</p>

<p>The priest looked at him. "What
do you mean?"</p>

<p>Dick paused a minute, resting his
head on his hand, then raised his
bright, clear eyes.</p>

<p>"What I say to a priest goes no
further?" he said interrogatively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">[763]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your confidence is safe with
me."</p>

<p>"Edith said that I should tell you
everything," Dick muttered, half to
himself, and for a moment his dreamy
eyes seemed to contemplate the
picture his mind held of her saying
so. A smile just stirred his lips, and
he went on. "I was born an outlaw,
sir. The conventionalities
which keep many people straight
had nothing to do with me. Then
I like adventure, and am hard to
frighten. I have been about, and
seen all sorts of people believing all
sorts of things, and one sort was as
good as another, as far as I could
see. The effect of this is, of course,
to make one liberal; but such a liberality,
if a man has not a settled
religious belief, unhinges the principles.
There have been times when
I have thought that it wasn't much
matter what I did. I had half a
mind to run away with Edith, and
turn privateer."</p>

<p>"Who is this Edith?"</p>

<p>"She is a little Catholic girl who
was brought up with me, sir. I'm
going to ask her to marry me, and I
think she will. She is the only person
in the world whom I depend on, or
who has any influence over me. I
believe in her. She is as true as
steel. And she believes in me. I
can't fail her, sir. That thought has
kept me from harm so far."</p>

<p>"It is a poor reason for being a
Catholic," the father said in a dissatisfied
tone. "It is a weak hold
on virtue when your motive is an
affection like this."</p>

<p>The young man smiled with a
sudden recollection.</p>

<p>"When we were at St. Michael's,
last winter, there was a great storm,
and a vessel was wrecked close to
the coast. We went down to the
shore to see, but nothing could be
done. One man swam to or was
washed to a little rock not far from
the shore. There he lay clinging,
with the waves breaking over him.
He couldn't have held on long, and
we could not get to him any way.
But Captain Cary brought out a big
bow and arrow of his that always
reminded me of Ulysses', for no one
but the captain, I believe, could
bend it, and, in a lull of the wind, he
shot a little cord over to the man, and
the man drew it out. Hope revived
his strength, I suppose, and it seemed
as if the tempest waited for him.
We tied a rope to the cord, and a
larger rope to that, and he drew it
out, and tied it to the rock, and we
saved him."</p>

<p>The priest smiled. "Very true.
We rise, we are saved sometimes by
degrees, and this little hold may be
tied to a stronger. Go out into the
church, and make the prayer of the
blind man, 'Lord, that I may receive
my sight.' To-morrow morning
I will baptize you. I find you
sufficiently instructed."</p>

<p>That evening Dick made a request
of the priest. "When men
were to be knighted, in olden times,"
he said, "they used to keep a vigil
in the church. Now, if by baptism
I am to be made fit to enter heaven
at once, changed from a child of the
devil to a child of God, why, it is
worth thinking about. It is a great
thing to happen in a man's life, and
it happens but once. I would like
to keep a vigil in the church. I
could think there better than anywhere
else."</p>

<p>The priest hesitated. He hardly
knew what to think of this mingled
coldness and fervor.</p>

<p>"Besides," the young man added,
"you say that Christ is there bodily.
I would like to watch with him one
night. It seems to me wrong to
leave him alone there now, when he
is to do so much for me to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">[764]</a></span></p>

<p>The priest consented. "But do
not fancy that the Lord is alone,
though his earthly children forsake
him," he said. "Doubtless the
place is crowded with angels and
archangels."</p>

<p>Dick gazed steadfastly at the priest,
and for a moment lost himself.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps," he began hesitatingly,
but broke off there. "No,
if he had preferred the company of
angels, he would have remained in
heaven," he said. "It will be no
intrusion. He comes here to be
with man."</p>

<p>Night came on, the church was
locked, and all was dark save a small
golden flame that burned suspended
in air. A watcher sat far back in
one of the seats, but after a while
drew nearer, still sitting, not kneeling.
The whole place was full of
silence and a sense of waiting. In
the shade, the stations hung unseen,
but not unfelt. He had seen them
that day, and they spoke through
the dark, "Here he fell! Here he
was struck! Here he was nailed to
the cross!"</p>

<p>There was in this darkness and
silence such a vacuum of the earthly,
that the heavenly seemed to break
through the thin wall of sense and
flow around the soul.</p>

<p>When the priest came in at daybreak,
he found his penitent prostrate
before the altar. After Mass
was over, the baptism took place.</p>

<p>The father was struck by the countenance
of his convert. It wore a
rapt and exalted expression, and he
appeared to see nothing of what was
visibly before his eyes.</p>

<p>"God bless you!" he said to Dick
on going out of the church. "Come
to see me. And for a while try to
think of God entirely, and not of
Miss Edith Yorke."</p>

<p>"Sir," said Dick quietly, "I have
thought of Edith Yorke but once
since I entered the church last night;
and then it was as though the Blessed
Virgin put her aside and stood in
her place."</p>

<p class="center">TO BE CONTINUED.</p>

<h2>A PAGE OF THE PAST AND A SHADOW OF THE FUTURE.</h2>


<p>It is, perhaps, hardly to be believed,
in this new country whose mental
geology grows and changes so quickly
that one stratum of thought and
of circumstances is gone even before
one has had time to analyze it&mdash;it is,
perhaps, hardly to be believed that
the shadow of the penal laws in the
mother-country should still cloud
with lingering touches the reminiscences
of a yet unfaded life. Young
people whose ideas and education
belong to this century can still remember
one of those priests of old&mdash;one
of those silent champions&mdash;whom
the English law made outcasts from
their kind, and fair game for their
enemies.</p>

<p>Such a one was James Duckett,
the pastor of a scattered flock that
covered the plain of Gresham, of historic
memory, to the fort of Edgehill,
the last standpoint of the "lost cause"
of the Stuarts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">[765]</a></span></p>

<p>The way in which his retreat was
discovered, by a party of Catholics
from one of the large country-houses
of Gloucestershire, was very amusing
as well as interesting.</p>

<p>They were returning from a picnic
at a charming old Tudor manor-house,
one of the seats of the Marquis
of Northampton, by name
Compton-Wyniatts, and where the
family tradition asserts a portion of
the Royalist army to have lain hidden
the eve of the terrible battle of
Edgehill. The house is full of holes
and hiding-places, sliding-panels, and
trap-doors, great ghostly chambers,
and funereal beds, not to mention
the vast cobwebbed garrets which
the soldiers are alleged to have occupied.
It has a very deserted appearance,
and, indeed, its owner hardly
ever lives there; but it is picturesque
in inverse ratio of its desolation.
Just outside the front courtyard is
the lawn, shaded by chestnut-trees,
and here the picnic took place.</p>

<p>Returning home, and passing
through the hamlet of Brailes, two
miles from Compton-Wyniatts, the
party observed some curious things
lying on the roadside hedges. Upon
examination, they proved to be ecclesiastical
vestments, and evidently
genuine Catholic property, ritualism
being as yet unknown in the
country districts of England. It
turned out that they belonged to
Mr. Duckett, and the whole party
repaired to Mr. Duckett's house.
This was a cottage in a little garden,
with a hay-field between it and the
old parish church, Protestant now,
but once the only home these costly
vestments should have known. There
was the old man, the priest of the
past, in the homely peasant garb,
now abandoned by the peasants
themselves, in coarse blue woollen
stockings and a snuff-colored coat,
and leather garters at the knee.
Huge-buckled shoes were on his
feet, and a thickly-folded neckcloth
was wound stiffly round his throat.
I saw him myself, later on, when the
existence of this living relic of the
penal days was better known among
the county circle. The lower room
of his cottage, stone-flagged and bare,
was a little school where a few children
were taught catechism and reading;
the upper rooms were reached
by a steep wooden staircase <em>outside</em>
the house. Here was a "large upper
chamber, furnished," and this was the
chapel. It was as cold, and bare,
and poor as it could well be; the
roughest workmanship was displayed
in the altar, the rails, and the
benches. The raftered and thatched
roof that was immediately above was
broken and untrustworthy, and the
rain of the last thunder-shower had
discolored both it and the floor below.
The small sacristy, off the
chapel, was in the same state of
decay and dilapidation; hence the
damage done to the vestments that
had been put out in the sun to dry.
Mr. Duckett had treasures here that
many modern churches might, and
with reason, have envied. The vestments&mdash;especially
a white cope and
a gold-embroidered chasuble&mdash;were
very rich and beautiful, and such as
must have been, no doubt, a gift from
some persecuted Catholic family to
the persecuted temple of God. But,
better still, there was a small leaden
chalice, said to have been used by
many of the martyrs of Tyburn, by
special permission given in consideration
of the difficulty of obtaining gold
and silver vessels for sacred purposes,
and of the probable sacrilege and
spoliation the known existence of
such vessels would provoke. And,
among other things, there was also a
little bell, wide and round, like a low-crowned
hat, and four little clappers
inside, making a sweet chime when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">[766]</a></span>
the bell was shaken. This was afterwards
copied by the modern artificers
of Birmingham, but they could not
transmit to their copy the mellow,
time-harmonized tone of the original.</p>

<p>In Mr. Duckett's sitting-room, a
small, unpretending, and homely
nook, was the portrait of his revered
and beloved patron, Bishop Bishop,
in Mr. Duckett's youth the only and
supreme ecclesiastical authority in
England. The priest was an old
man now, seventy-five or thereabouts,
but his heart was true yet to
his friend and patron, whose praises
he was never tired of repeating. He
told, also, how, although parishes had
been formed around him and churches
had grown up at his side, yet once his
duties carried him on midnight rides
and to distances of forty or fifty miles,
for a sick-call or a promised and occasional
Mass at some one of the many
places that claimed his care. Broadway,
a village at the foot of the Coteswold
Hills, just at the edge of the fruitful
plain or vale of Gresham, was one
of these stations, and now, as for many
long years past, there stands in its
midst the Passionist Monastery of St.
Saviour, the novitiate house for the
province of Great Britain. Two hundred
Catholics and a spacious church,
model schools under government inspection,
and confraternities of many
kinds, have turned the far-off hamlet,
where a few stray and hunted Catholics
were hidden, into a very centre
of religion for twenty miles around.
Wordnorton, the hunting-box of the
Duc d'Aumale, and Chipping-Campden,
a thriving little mission on the
opposite ridge of the Coteswold, are
both served from the monastery at
Broadway; and so great is the personal
ascendency of the monks, and
so universal their popularity, that they
need not fear the letter of the law, and
<em>do</em> often contravene it by walking
abroad in their monastic habit.</p>

<p>Here is one of the changes that
have occurred in the straggling field
of Mr. Duckett's early labors; and,
while all this is happening around
him, the calm old man waits for his
summons in the same homely and
unobtrusive dress he has sanctified
by his daily work in the vineyard of
Christ.</p>

<p>It is said, and I believe with truth&mdash;at
least, I <em>hope</em> so&mdash;that the monastic
garb of all religious orders
was originally modelled on the
coarse habiliments of the poorest
and simplest of mankind&mdash;the shepherds
and husbandmen of the hard-working
rural districts. If so, it suggests
a very beautiful and a very
happy thought, and brings before our
eyes the many parables in which
God's church is likened to a field,
a vineyard, an orchard, a garden.
Tillers of the soil and sowers of the
grain, reapers of the harvest and fosterers
of the vine, are priests and deacons,
bishops and monks; and all
through sacred history runs this
touching parallel. Nowhere is religion
without her crown of nature's
weaving: the blossoming rod and
the sceptre of Christ's jurisdiction
are one.</p>

<p>And so, to return to our friend, the
priest and pastor of a forgotten and
happily buried age of persecution,
God's voice called <em>him</em> in time, and
among the many who daily wait in
the temple's outer court he was
chosen to blossom forth in a higher
life, and to wear his robe of glory in a
nobler place than that where he had
clothed himself like the poor and the
unnoticed, and only wore by stealth
the sacred garments of his priesthood.</p>

<p>He died in the year 1866, if I mistake
not, and his place was filled by
a young man, newly ordained, as if
to bear witness how suddenly one
state of things had died away and
another had come in its stead, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">[767]</a></span>
also, perchance, to point out to us&mdash;too
secure in our present safety&mdash;that
as quickly as freedom had followed
persecution, so we should be ever
ready to see persecution follow freedom.</p>

<p>And in these days, surely, we dare
not think such a past as that of English
religious intolerance so far from
us as that it should never draw near
us again, and renew itself in many
shapes of tyranny and horror. And
this, not only in England, where
religious persecution may suddenly
emerge from the apparent extreme
of religious indifference, and where it
may be carried on, some day, on
members of all Christian communities,
no longer in the name of a state
church or a general catechism, but
in the name of rabid hatred to a
Creator, God, and senseless chafing
against <em>any</em> constituted authority&mdash;not
only, I say, may this happen in
England, but in other lands, Eastern
and Western, old and new.</p>

<p>We see it to-day in red-handed
France and Judas-tongued Italy; we
may see it elsewhere to-morrow. Persecution
is an instinct of the brute;
what is not after its own kind, it has
no desire to spare. The prevailing
systems of philosophy&mdash;if we may so
degrade the word whose first meaning
is love of wisdom&mdash;tend to the
apotheosis of the brute, and the negation
and indignant repudiation of
anything in man above the brute.
When this task shall be completed,
and man <i>educated</i> into the right usage
of his newly-discovered nature, what
are we to expect but persecution in
one form or another from the new
lords of the creation, the new monarchs
of the system of materialistic
supremacy?</p>

<p>There is a new and subtle alchemy
running through the so-called moral
world, the Areopagus of modern
thinkers. Of old, all things might
be resolved into component parts, of
which <em>gold</em> was infallibly one; now,
all men must be resolved into perishable
parts, of which <em>each</em> one is
stamped with the brand of the brute.</p>

<p>It is a sad contrast, and no doubt
it would be needless to define which
of the two is the more harmful theory.
Let us pass now from the life of the
hidden pastor of an obscure village
to an incident, perhaps hardly better
known, in the career of one of the
apostles of a great and glorious city,
the same whose comeliness has been
so cruelly brought low, and whose
desolation at this moment reminds
one too forcibly of the plaint of the
prophet Jeremiah over doomed Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The Père de Ravignan, whose
name is a household word in France,
and whose influence over the young
men of his day was something all but
miraculous, was summoned one night
to attend a sick-call. A carriage was
in attendance; the two men who had
come for him represented the case as
of the greatest urgency, but refused
to take him with them unless he
suffered himself to be blindfolded.
After briefly hesitating, he complied
with this strange request. The times
were dangerous, revolution was hovering
like a storm over the state, secret
societies were in ever-watchful and
almost infallibly secure fermentation.
He himself was a well-known man, a
representative man, one whose voice
was ever raised uncompromisingly
against the foes of law and order&mdash;one
whose life was every day exposed,
in consequence of his grand fearlessness
of conscience, to the machinations
of hidden and treacherous enemies.
A less suspicious man might
have feared a snare in this strange
condition of blindfolding a priest
called to a death-bed, but the blood
of the old race of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilhommes</i>
that was fast disappearing, added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">[768]</a></span>
the courage of the consecrated line
of God's ministers that never disappears,
made the Jesuit strong in this
hour of peril, and he forgot himself
to think only of the sinking soul to
whose aid he was summoned. He took
the holy oils and the viaticum with
him, and left the house in the Rue
de Sèvres in the carriage that was
waiting at the door.</p>

<p>They drove off rapidly; his companions
pulled down the blinds, and
effectually shut out any daylight that
might straggle in. The motion of the
vehicle, however, and the many sudden
jerks it gave, indicated turnings
and corners as being constantly
doubled, and even suggested the not
unlikely idea that this was done on
purpose, with the object of confusing
the priest's recollection. The two
men preserved a dead silence all the
time. At last the carriage stopped;
the door was opened, the Père de
Ravignan helped out, and conducted
up a wide staircase; doors were
opened and shut, and then the bandage
was taken from his eyes, and he
found himself in a large anteroom,
handsomely and massively furnished.</p>

<p>"In the end room of this suite of
apartments, you will find the person
who requires your ministry," said one
of his guides.</p>

<p>He passed room after room with
the windows darkened, and rich furniture
giving a sumptuous air to the
large and airy saloons, but order
reigned everywhere. He saw neither
sign of confusion nor heard any
sound of sorrow, nothing to indicate
the presence of death or mortal sickness.
He began to fear that in truth
he had been snared by secret enemies,
and that it was his own death he had
to expect as the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i> of this
solemn masquerade. The last door
was reached; a curtain hung across
the entrance, and the chamber was
darkened. One lamp burned in the
furthest recess. He looked in vain
for signs of sickness; there were none.
The room was a drawing-room, and
was furnished much like the rest.
But soon a form rose to meet him,
coming slowly from the luxurious
lounge near the solitary lamp. It
was that of a young man, very handsome,
and fashionably dressed. He
looked pale and anxious, and his
hands trembled slightly as he moved.
Yet sick to death he certainly was
not. Was this his executioner, or
some part of the ghastly pageant of
his own coming doom? The priest
paused, and the young stranger said,
in eager, hollow tones:</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon père</i>, it is for <em>me</em> that you
are here. I am going to die. I shall
be dead within twenty-four hours,
but I obtained this favor that I
might first make my peace with
God."</p>

<p>"My son, what does this mean?"
asked the priest. "You are not ill!"</p>

<p>"No; yet I shall not see to-morrow's
sunset. I dare say no more.
I must make my confession."</p>

<p>An hour went by; the solemn mysteries
that pass unseen and undreamt-of
by the careless world soothed and
comforted the doomed man. We
know nothing further, nor can we
ever know aught concerning this
dread interview on the very threshold
of invisible death; but, the priest's duty
done, the young man craved his
blessing and his prayers, and took
an agonizing farewell of the last human
being who was to show him
mercy and promise him forgiveness.</p>

<p>Reluctantly, sorrowfully, the priest
parted from the victim, and wended
his way through the splendid rooms,
whose beauty now seemed so baleful,
as though it were but the refinement
and gloss of cruelty, the gay
mask that hid the torture-chamber.</p>

<p>At the door of the anteroom, the
same silent guides were watching his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">[769]</a></span>
return, and, again blindfolding him,
led him out of the gates that closed
on such strange mysteries, and hid
from view such appalling possibilities
of horror.</p>

<p>How many might there have been
of these human holocausts, immolated
in silence, perchance without
the gracious respite allowed this <em>one</em>
victim! How many might there
have been, perhaps priests, beguiled
by a lure such as he had thought his
own carrying-off to be, and never
allowed to go forth again, as <em>he</em> was
being providentially helped to do!
And what other crimes besides silent
murder might have taken place in
that mysterious and seemingly demon-guarded
house!</p>

<p>These and other thoughts not unlike
them must have pressed painfully
on his overstrung mind, as with
the same precautions, turnings, doublings,
and joltings the Père de Ravignan
was driven back to the house
of his order, the sinister guides in
whose hands his life had helplessly
and inevitably lain for several hours
preserving yet that impenetrable silence
and seemingly respectful behavior,
which in themselves were
enough to shake the courage of most
men.</p>

<p>The house was all astir. Every one
had been anxious for the safe return
of the superior from his mysterious
and perilous errand; for perilous they
had intuitively felt it to be, and had
indeed once attempted at first to
follow the carriage. This, however,
had been cleverly frustrated by the
well-instructed driver.</p>

<p>Search was made next day by the
secret police for any house answering
the only description the priest could
imperfectly give; inquiries were instituted
concerning the disappearance
of any person answering the minute
description given by the confessor of
his young penitent; but although the
police swore that they knew every
house, and could put their finger
upon every individual in Paris, yet
not a single trace could be discovered
of anything unusual having taken
place in the city.</p>

<p>And there the mystery remained
and was forgotten, and came to be
related only as a tale of dread and
wonder, and was only known to few.
Even so the secret organization itself,
for nothing but vagueness surrounded
its palpable though ever-invisible
existence, and some believed
that the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti prêtre</i> invented stories
of its horrors, and others thought
they exaggerated the importance of
its influence.</p>

<p>Then came '48, with its wild volcanic
outburst all over Europe, and
under the name of freedom a modern
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vehmgericht</i> convulsed and tortured
the civilized world. Those who
had pooh-poohed its existence or underrated
its strength were the first
to crouch before its explosive power.
Persecution began again, for we all
know the story of revolutions, and
how the final court of appeal was
always death. What mattered it
that the persecutors handled the axe,
the guillotine, or the rifle, instead of
the scourges, the <i>fasces</i>, the swords of
the Roman lictors? Amphitheatres
there were, and wild beasts to tear
the Christians in pieces, although the
former were called public squares,
and streets, and gardens, and the
wild beasts were hideous human
forms. One Archbishop of Paris in
'48 was shot down&mdash;perhaps by
chance, but who can tell save only
God?&mdash;on the barricades, as he was
trying to quiet the infuriate rabble;
another Archbishop of Paris followed
him in '71, more foully murdered
in shear demoniac wantonness, because
order and authority were represented
in his person, and because
to be a child of God was a burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">[770]</a></span>
reproach offered to the godless and
soulless Commune.</p>

<p>Thus, two ages of persecution join
hands within a short half-century,
and in one life, yet in its prime, two
figures are prominently and personally
interwoven: the old peasant priest
who almost dreaded to have the
sanctuary lamps lighted for fear of
attracting unwelcome notice, so imbued
was he with the idea that before
the law a Catholic must need
be a criminal; and the intrepid Jesuit,
having secret dangers in the
fulfilment of his ministry, and knowing
full well that, before the self-styled
law of lawless <i>liberty</i>, to be a
priest is to be nothing better than a
dog.</p>

<p>Some talk lightly of these things
that are passing as of mere ebullitions
that cannot fail to be quelled;
but where is the power to quell, the
power to charm these serpents, to
humanize these savages? Gone
from the kings of the earth, who
have abjured the aid of religion, who
have expelled her from the schools
and colleges, and repudiated her
offices in the most solemn and tender
relations of life. Gone from the
philosophers of this century, who control
the thoughts of millions by pandering
freely to their passions, and
whose first axiom is that everything
that is <i>natural is right</i>. Gone from
the timid politicians, whose precarious
object is, not the happy and
steady consolidation and progress of
the state, but the maintenance of
themselves and their creatures in office,
and the increase of their hoarded
fortunes. Gone, too, from the
poets and artists, who should clothe
truth and religion in dignified and
attractive forms, but whose dearest
aim is but to court popularity by encouraging
vice. Gone, in a word, from
all whose mission it is to raise and
guide the people, simply because
they find it more profitable to grovel
with and follow them.</p>

<p>And religion stands this day as
our divine Lord stood centuries ago
in the Garden of Gethsemani, with
lukewarm and timid disciples in
numbers, and with a Judas striving
with honeyed words to betray her.
The sword she may not use, nor any
earthly weapon; for, if God would
have it so, could he not send her
twelve legions of angels? But no;
she stands as he stood, unarmed;
and when she preached with the
voice of princes and commanded
through the mouth of statesmen, no
one attacked her, even as the Jews
did not apprehend Jesus when he
taught openly in the synagogue.
But when worldly power was taken
away, when concordats were broken,
when heresy rose up in her midst,
the enemies of the church fell upon
her, and in their onslaught tore up
kingdoms by the root and trampled
order in the dust. The crushed ones
look to her&mdash;"they shall look upon
him they have pierced"&mdash;imploringly,
but <em>they</em> had tied her hands, <em>they</em>
had crippled her in the days of their
triumph, and the deluge breaks over
them and annihilates them, while it
tosses the church on its turbid waves,
and at each angry toss only lifts the
Ark of the Covenant safer and higher
toward heaven.</p>

<p>We may be only at the beginning
of a scathing trial: we may be almost
at its end. We have seen the
blood of the martyrs flow once more;
we have seen '71 rival '93, and the
Mazas Prison reflect the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Massacre des
Carmes</i>; elsewhere we see the spectre
of blood not yet let loose, but hiding
impatiently behind the spirit of sacrilege
and spoliation. Perhaps this is the
hour before the dawn; perhaps only
the first watch of the night. But let
us not think that the nineteenth century
bears a charmed life, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">[771]</a></span>
we dwellers in it have a prescriptive
right to a safe and easy-going existence.
We must be <em>for</em> the church, <em>in</em>
her, <em>with</em> her <em>of</em> her; be hers in spirit
and in truth, "not merely pause and
hesitate at the threshold, or linger
within the outer courts." This is the
hour of conversions, for the next may
be the hour of martyrdom. And
above all, it is the hour for sound
philosophy, that will lead us firmly
by the hand into the haven of faith,
and show us that, to be a good citizen,
one has need to be a perfect
Christian.</p>

<p>Truth is one; and just as water
will rise to its own level, so all particles
of truth will lead to the fountain
of truth. The church has solved
all problems, and fulfilled all
yearnings, and realized all ideals
long ago; and while men are seeking
what they severally want, the church
has offered it to thousands of their
forefathers before they themselves
were ever born to seek it.</p>

<h2>LIQUEFACTION OF THE BLOOD OF ST. JANUARIUS.</h2>


<p>On the nineteenth day of September,
there will be gathered together
from five to eight thousand persons
in the grand cathedral of Naples, to
witness again an occurrence which,
though it has been witnessed thousands
of times already, never fails to
fill the beholder with astonishment
and awe. Perhaps one-half of the
crowd may be from the city of Naples
itself. A large portion comes from
other parts of Italy. Many are from
Austria, Illyria, Hungary, Bavaria,
and Prussia, Russia, England, France,
and Spain. Some are from the Western
hemisphere. And Moors, Egyptians,
Arabs, and Turks, ever travelling
along the shores of the Mediterranean,
are here, too, raising their turbaned
heads among these thousands in the
cathedral, as intent and as filled with
emotion as any around them.</p>

<p>The greater part of that crowd
believe that they are witnesses of a
deed done by the direct will and
power of God&mdash;a miracle; and very
naturally their hearts are filled with
awe and devotion. Others, again, are
in doubt what to believe on the point;
but they have come to see, and to see
exactly for themselves what really
does occur. Others, again, are sure
beforehand that it is all a trick. They
will spare no pains to detect the
fraud.</p>

<p>What is it they are all assembled
to see? The large cathedral in
which they stand fronts on a little
square to the north. At the southern
extremity is placed the grand sanctuary
and high altar, with a large
and rich basement chapel underneath.
On either side of the church above,
there are, as is usual in Italian
churches, small side chapels and
altars; but about the middle of the
western side a large archway gives
admission to a very large chapel&mdash;to-day
the centre of attraction. We
might call it a small church. The
Neapolitans name it the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i>. It
is cruciform, and a well-proportioned
dome rises above the intersection of
its nave and transept. Towards its
western extremity, and opposite the
crowded archway or entrance from
the cathedral, stands its elevated
high altar; six other altars occupy
the transept and sides. The main
altar stands about five feet forward,
out from the solid stone wall of the
building. Behind that altar, in the
massive masonry of the wall, is a
double closet, closed by strong metal
doors, and secured by four locks.
From this closet, at nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, is first
taken out a metal life-sized bust, held
to contain what remains of the bones
of the head of St. Januarius, bishop
and martyr, who was put to death in
the year 305. This bust is placed on
the main altar, at the Gospel end.
Next, an old and tarnished silver case
is brought out from the other side
of the same closet. All eyes scrutinize
it. The front and the back of it,
or, rather, both faces of it, for they
are alike, are of heavy glass, securely
fastened to the silver frame. Looking
through these plates of glass, the
interior of the case is seen to contain
two antique Roman vials of glass,
held securely in their places above
and below by rude masses of soldering,
black with age. The vials are
of different patterns, both very common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">[773]</a><br /><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">[774]</a></span>
in the museums of Roman antiquities.
The smaller one is empty,
save some patches of stain or pellicle
adhering to the interior of its sides.
The other one, which might hold a
gill and a half, is seen to contain a
dark-colored solid substance, occupying
about four-fifths of the space
within the vial. This substance is
held to be a portion of the blood of
the same martyred saint, gathered by
the Christians when he was decapitated,
and ever since carefully preserved.
Ordinarily it is hard and solid, as it
well may be fifteen hundred and
sixty-odd years after being shed.
The case, or <i>reliquary</i>, as it is properly
called, is borne to the main
altar, and a priest holds it midway
between the middle of the altar and
the bust, that is, about a foot from
the latter. Prayers are said; hymns,
psalms, and litanies are recited by
the clergy kneeling near. Meanwhile,
from time to time the priest
moves the reliquary from side to side,
that he may see whether the expected
change of the substance within the
vial has taken place or not; and he
presents it to the bystanders crowded
around him on the steps of the altar,
that each one in succession may reverently
kiss it and closely scrutinize
its condition. At length, after a
greater or smaller lapse of time, perhaps
in a few minutes, perhaps only
after several hours, perhaps after
many hours, the solid mass within
the vial becomes liquid&mdash;perhaps
instantaneously, perhaps rapidly, at
times more slowly and gradually,
several hours elapsing before the
change becomes complete. Sometimes
only a portion of the mass becomes
liquid, the remaining portion
floating as a still hard lump in the
liquid portion. This change is what
is known as <i>the liquefaction of the
blood of St. Januarius</i>, and is what
these thousands have crowded the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i> chapel and the cathedral to
witness.</p>

<p>It has occurred repeatedly each
year for centuries back. It occurs
in public under the eyes of thousands.
Accounts of it were written by learned
men and by travellers before the invention
of printing. In these latter
centuries, accounts of it have been
published in Latin, in Italian, in
Polish, in English, French, German,
and Spanish&mdash;we presume, in every
language of Europe. Some are written
by devout believers in the miracle;
some by candid but perplexed witnesses,
who examined for themselves
and are afraid to come to a conclusion;
while others that we have seen
are filled with such mistakes, both as
to persons and events and to established
regulations, that we felt the
writers had themselves seen little or
nothing. They had merely got a
hint from one and a suggestion from
another, and had filled out the remainder
from the storehouse of their
own imagination.</p>

<p>We are privileged to insert a full
account, written by an American eye-witness
in 1864. We are unwilling
to abbreviate it too much, although
the reader will find in it thoughts we
have already expressed or may hereafter
have to dwell on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I had for years determined that, if
ever I had a chance, I would go to Naples
to see myself the celebrated miracle.
This year gave me the desired opportunity,
and I would not neglect it. Leaving
Rome by railway, on September 17, I
reached Naples that evening, and early
the next morning went to the cathedral
to introduce myself, to say Mass, and
to take a preparatory look. The cathedral
is an immense semi-Gothic building,
dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, to St.
Januarius, and to other patron saints of
the city. St. Januarius, a native of Naples,
was Bishop of Benevento (a city
some thirty miles, inland), and was apprehended
in the days of persecution under
Diocletian, held in prison, exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">[775]</a></span>
the wild beasts without harm, and finally
beheaded near Puzzuoli, about five miles
from Naples, in the year 305. His head
and body were taken by the Christians,
and transported&mdash;probably by night, certainly
in secrecy&mdash;across the bay to the
southern shore, and were entombed, between
Mount Vesuvius and the sea, on
the farm of a Christian called Marcian.
It was the custom of the Christians to
gather, as far as they possibly could, the
blood shed by their martyrs, and, placing
a portion of it in glass vials, to deposit
such vials in the tombs. In the catacombs
at Rome such vials in a niche are
the surest sign that a martyr was there
deposited. You can still see some of
them, or fragments of them, in the opened
vaults or niches of the catacombs. The
vials within have a thin, dark-reddish
crust, showing still where the blood
reached in the glass. A few years ago,
a chemical analysis of a portion of such
crust or pellicle, made by direction of
his Holiness, fully confirmed this historical
and traditional statement of its origin.
Such vials are also to be seen in
multitudes in the Vatican and other
Christian museums, and in the churches
to which the remains of the martyrs have
been transferred. As St. Januarius was
a prominent Christian, and as his martyrdom
attracted the earnest attention of
all, we may and should naturally suppose
that his case was no exception,
and that a portion of the blood was
gathered in his case, and, as usual, that
the vials containing it were deposited
with the body in the tomb.</p>

<p>In the year 385, peace having been
fully restored, and Christian churches
built, and things quieted, the remains of
St. Januarius were solemnly transferred
from their original resting-place to Naples,
and were placed in a church or
chapel dedicated to him, and situated
just outside the city walls. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">San Gennaro
extra muros</i> still stands, though, of course,
the first building has been replaced by a second,
a third, I believe by a fourth church.
Here, henceforth, near their martyr and
patron saint, the Neapolitan Christians
wished to be buried. And when an oath
was to be taken with the most binding
force and obligation, it was administered
and taken before the altar where lay enshrined
the remains of this great Neapolitan
saint. In course of time&mdash;it is not
precisely known when, or by what archbishop&mdash;the
head of St. Januarius and
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampullæ</i> or vials containing his blood
were transferred into the city, and placed
in some church&mdash;probably in the cathedral,
where we know that, eight hundred
years ago, they were carefully and reverently
preserved in the cathedral, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i>
or treasury, as they called the strong,
vaulted chamber of stone in which the
relics of the saints were safely kept.
The body of the saint was left in the
church <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">extra muros</i>. It was afterwards
taken to Benevento, thence to Monte
Vergine, and in 1497 was transferred to
Naples, and now lies under the principal
altar of the subterranean crypt or basement
chapel, beneath the sanctuary of
the cathedral.</p>

<p>The cathedral itself is, as I said, a
large semi-Gothic building, over three
hundred feet long and one hundred and
twenty wide, lofty, well-proportioned, and
filled with columns, frescoes, marbles,
statuary, paintings, and gilding, very
bright and very clean. It fronts on a
small square to the north. The sanctuary
is at the southern end. In the west
side of the building is a large, open archway,
about thirty feet broad and forty
feet high, with a lofty open-work railing
of bronzed metal, and of very artistic
design. A folding-door in this railing,
of the same material, opens twelve feet
wide to usher you into another good-sized
church or chapel, called the new <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i>
or chapel of St. Januarius, commenced in
1608, by the city, in special honor of the
saint, and in fulfilment of a vow, and consecrated
in 1646. It is nearly in the
form of a Greek cross, over a hundred
feet from east to west, and about eighty
from north to south. The arms are about
forty feet wide, and at their intersection
a cupola rises to over a hundred feet
above the level of the floor. It is said
this chapel cost half a million of dollars.
If so, the city fathers got the full worth
of their money in rich marbles, in mosaics,
frescoes, bronze and marble statues, and
in every sort of finest decorations. There
is a complete service for this chapel,
entirely distinct from and independent
of that of the cathedral proper&mdash;a dean,
twelve chaplains, other minor assistants
as needed, and a thoroughly supplied
sacristy. In this <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i> chapel are no
less than seven altars; the main one, to
the west, opposite the entrance from the
church, another grand one, and two
subsidiary ones on either side of the
chapel. There is also a fine organ. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">[776]</a></span>
main altar stands about five feet forward
from the rear wall of the building, leaving
thus a commodious passage-way between
them. In the massive stone wall itself,
to the rear of the main altar, are two
armories, adjoining each other. In one
of them, that to the south, the relic of the
head of St. Januarius is kept; in the
other, to the north, are preserved the
vials containing his blood. These armories,
which I might call a double armory,
are in the solid masonry, and are
closed by strong gilt metal doors, about
thirty inches broad and fifty inches high,
each secured by an upper and a lower
lock.</p>

<p>So much I saw at this visit in the
cathedral and in the chapel. The afternoon
I devoted to a visit to Puzzuoli,
and the scene of the martyrdom of St.
Januarius and his six companions. On
the way, we stopped to look at and enter
the reputed tomb of Virgil, and we passed
through the grotto of Posilippo. As
the carriage rolled on over the smooth
macadamized road, the Bay of Naples
stretched away on our left in all its
beauty, smiling and rippling in the September
breeze, just as it did on the day
they were beheaded. Before us was
Puzzuoli, once the beautiful summer resort
and watering-place for the richest
nobles of ancient Rome, often graced by
the presence of the emperor himself, and
still a place of pretension. On our
right, hills and vineyards and olive groves
stood now as they stood then. The palaces
and houses which the saint looked
on are all gone; but their solid stone
foundation walls have not perished, and
other houses of more modern aspect rise
on them. The mineral springs at the
foot of the hills are still the same, and
in the same repute; and hundreds are
still going to them, or meet us returning
after their baths. Here and there, alongside
our smooth modern road, we see
patches of the old Roman pavement,
large, irregularly-shaped slabs of hard
stone, lying now much less evenly than
they did when senators, and consuls, and
prefects, and Roman nobles loved to
walk along this road, to enjoy the beautiful
scene, and to drink in the healthful
evening breezes that came to them over
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>We reached Puzzuoli, and its narrow,
crooked streets soon led us to the summit
of a knoll or spur of the hills, now
a little back of the modern city. Here
the ancients had placed their amphitheatre.
Its remains are still well preserved.
The galleries for the dignitaries, the
seats for the spectators&mdash;it could hold
15,000 at least&mdash;the arena, where the
gladiators fought and fell, and where
wild beasts tore each other or destroyed
their human victims, are all still to be
easily recognized. We entered a cellar
or masonry chamber under the lofty seats.
Here the victims were kept until the hour
came for thrusting them forth into the
arena in the centre. It is now a chapel,
with a single plain altar, at which Mass
is celebrated from time to time. A votive
lamp hangs down from the arched
masonry above The walls are plain
and void of ornament. The place needs
little decoration. Who can kneel there,
and not feel his heart swell as he remembers
St. Januarius and his companions
kneeling and praying, and awaiting
their summons? It came, and they were
led forth. We went, too, to the arena.
Here they stood, sustained by the constancy
of faith. There is the seat aloft
of the prefect and his attendants and
officers, who condemned these Christians
to death by the wild beasts, and have
come to look on the bloody drama.
There, all around, rising backwards, row
above row, are the seats, filled then by
thousands hoarsely screaming, "<i>The
Christians to the lions!</i>" To their voices
answered the angry growls and roars of
lions and panthers, shut in their dens
beneath&mdash;those recesses in the masonry
below the lowest, the front rank of seats.
For one or two days past the beasts have
been deprived of their food, that they
might be more furious and eager for the
tragedy. Excited by the clamor, maddened
by hunger, frenzied, too, perhaps
by the sight of the victims, whom they
could see through the bars of their doors&mdash;for
perhaps they had already had experience
of such feasts&mdash;the beasts walked
impatiently from end to end of their
small prisons, glared and growled
through the bars, or impatiently strove
to tear them down. The prefect gives the
signal: the multitude is hushed in silent
expectation. The servitors hurry forward
to the edge of the seats above, and
with cords and pulleys are lifting upwards
the heavy doors in their grooves.
The iron grates against the stone as it
mounts. Soon out from below into the
arena leap the ravenous wild beasts.
They rush on, each one intent on seizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_777" id="Page_777">[777]</a></span>
a victim. They crouch, as is their nature,
for a final spring, fastening their
glaring eyes on the martyrs; but they
spring not. The eye loses its glare;
the stiffened mane and bristling hair
become smooth, and, with moans almost
of affection, they draw themselves gently
over the sand up to the martyrs, and
fawn on them and lick their feet.
There will be no bloody tragedy here
to-day. God vouchsafes to the prefect
Timotheus and to these multitudes
another proof of the saintly character
and heavenly authority of these men
whom they would slay. Some, we may
hope, were awed, and believed, and returned
to their homes with hearts yielding
to the grace of God; but not so the
prefect, nor the majority of that crowd.
"Sorcery! Witchcraft! Chaldean superstition!"
they cried. "Away with the
dangerous magicians! If they can do
this, what can they not do? Who is
safe? Slay them at once!" The prefect
ordered them to be led out to the top of
a neighboring hill, and to be beheaded
on its summit in the sight of all and as a
warning to all. We followed the steep
and narrow old Roman road up which
they must have walked. The rains have
not yet washed away all of the old Roman
pavement. Vines and olive-trees
and flowers of richest hues shade it and
beautify it now, and were not wanting to
it in those days of imperial luxury. To
our martyrs it was the road to heaven.
No earthly beauty could cheer them as
they were cheered by Christian faith and
the firm hopes of quickly reaching a
blessed immortality. We reached the
spot of execution, the level top of a
knoll, overlooking some part of the city,
the beautiful bay, Puzzuoli, and much of
the neighboring country. A little church
stands here now, served by a small community
of Capuchins, who hold the faith
of the martyrs, and try to imitate their
virtues; who seek first the kingdom of
heaven and its righteousness, and hope
that, like the martyrs they honor, they
may pass from this consecrated spot to
the abode of bliss. Here the saint and
his six companions were beheaded. The
Capuchins showed us in the church a
stone, now inserted in the wall and carefully
preserved, said to have been stained
by his blood, and still to show the stains.
They said, too, that, when the blood of St.
Januarius liquefies in Naples, these stains
grow moist and assume a brighter reddish
color. This I had no opportunity of
verifying. Here, too, we might almost
guess the route down the precipitous
sides of the hill to the waters of the
bay, almost under our feet, by which
that night the Christians bore the body
of the saint to their boat. Across the
bay, five or six miles off, we could see
the houses of Torre dell' Annunziata,
near where they landed with it. A little
back lay the farm of the Christian where
they entombed it. A Benedictine monastery
from the sixth century marked
the spot....</p>

<p>As you may well suppose, night overtook
us before we got back to Naples.
The next morning, I went to the cathedral
again. It was the 19th of September,
the festival proper of the saint&mdash;the day
of his martyrdom and entrance into
heaven. The exposition of his relics,
during which the liquefaction usually
occurs, commences at nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> I was
at the door of the chapel at half-past
eight. I found the chapel already crammed
and jammed. Still, way was made
for me somehow. I went to the sacristy,
and was then conducted back to the
chapel, and into the space behind the
main altar, in front of the armories, to
await the hour appointed. Of course,
the crowd could not yet enter the sanctuary
of the main altar, much less pass
behind the altar. Only five or six privileged
persons were there. Mass was being
celebrated at the altar itself. That
over, we sat and waited, and I asked
questions on the all-absorbing subject.</p>

<p>Since the building and opening of this
new <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i> chapel&mdash;that is, since <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
1646&mdash;the relics are in the keeping of the
Archbishop of Naples and the city authorities
conjointly. Everything is regulated
by the long and minute agreement
then entered into by all parties. I said
each door of the armories has two locks.
The archbishop keeps the key of one,
the city authorities the key of the other.
The armories cannot be approached except
through the open chapel, and cannot
be opened, save by violence, unless both
parties are present with their keys.</p>

<p>I was patiently waiting for nine o'clock
to strike. Our number was increasing.
At last there joined us behind the altar
a tall, thin, gentlemanly man, all in black,
about forty-five years of age. He was
introduced to me as Count C&mdash;&mdash;, the
delegate to-day on the part of the city.
He bore a large red velvet purse or bag,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">[778]</a></span>
with gold cords and braiding, very rich
in its workmanship. Opening its mouth,
he drew forth two good-sized, long-handled
antique keys with complicated
wards. They were connected by a steel
chain, strong and light, about fifteen inches
in length. The cardinal, Riario Sforza,
is absent in Rome, driven into exile by
Victor Emmanuel's government; but
before leaving he gave his keys in charge
to one of the chief ecclesiastics of the
city in his stead. Accordingly, a canon
of the cathedral soon appeared, bearing
another red velvet bag, something like
the first, but not so rich, and, moreover,
somewhat faded. He, too, took out of
his bag two good-sized, long-handled
keys, equally antique in their look and
complicated in their wards, and similarly
connected by a steel chain. Count C&mdash;&mdash;
inserted one of his keys in the lower
lock of the armory to the south, and
turned it. We heard the bolt shoot back.
The pious-looking canon was short, and
the upper lock was rather high, so they
placed some portable steps in position.
He ascended them, and inserted one of
his keys in the upper lock. That bolt
shot back, too; and he swung the heavy
metal door open. We looked into the
interior of the armory, about two feet
wide, three and a-half or four feet high,
and sixteen or twenty inches deep, in the
masonry of the wall. It was lined with
slabs of white marble, and a scarlet silk
curtain hung down towards the front. A
thick metal partition divided it from the
other armory. One of the chaplains of
the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i> then mounted the steps, and
took out from the armory a life-sized
bust of St. Januarius, of silver gilt. A
mitre on the head of it, and a short cope
which had been put on the shoulders,
designated his episcopal character. In
the head of this bust are contained the
relics of the head of the saint.</p>

<p>We know precisely when this bust was
made; for in the spring of 1306 an
entry was made in the account-books of
Charles of Anjou, then sovereign of Naples,
stating how much silver and how
much gold from the king's treasury had
been given to a certain artificer as materials,
and how much money was paid to
him for his workmanship, in making this
very bust. In making it, he modelled
the features after a very ancient bust of
the saint, still existing in Puzzuoli. In
the archiepiscopal diary, relative to St.
Januarius, under the date 13th September,
1660, there is a long account stating
that, it being perceived that the relics
inside this bust had become somehow
displaced&mdash;as well they might after 355
years&mdash;the cardinal archbishop, on that
day, in the presence of all requisite
witnesses, had the bust opened by a
goldsmith; himself reverently took out
the relics, and held them in his hands
until the goldsmith had repaired the damage;
that his eminence then reverently
replaced the relics, properly sealed,
and had the bust closed as before, and
in all this carefully observed the prescriptions
of canon law. Since then, everything
has been untouched.</p>

<p>Four other chaplains, with torches, attended
the chaplain whom I saw take
out this bust, and it was borne in procession
round to the front of the altar,
and deposited on the altar itself, just
where the missal would stand when the
Gospel is read. They then returned to
the armory.</p>

<p>Count C&mdash;&mdash; with his second key unlocked
the lower lock of the other&mdash;the
northern armory. The little canon again
mounted the steps, unlocked the upper
one, and swung back the metal door.
We looked into the armory: it was just
the fellow of the first&mdash;size, marble lining,
red silk curtain, and all. The same
chaplain then, as before, took out the
reliquary containing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampullæ</i> or vials
of the blood. I will describe it. Conceive
a bar or thick plate of silver, about
two and a-half inches wide and about
sixteen inches long, to be bent until it
forms a ring or circle of about five inches
diameter. Let a circular plate of glass
of the requisite diameter be inserted and
firmly fastened to the edge of the silver
ring on one side, and a similar plate of
glass be also inserted and firmly fastened
to the other edge. You will thus have,
as it were, the centre-piece of an ostensory,
five inches across and two and one-half
inches through, with a silver rim,
and glass plates forming the front and
rear. On the top, let there be a little ornamental
scroll-work, cherubs and their
wings, and a central stem rising upward,
and bearing an oval crown three inches
by two inches, and above that a small
elegantly-worked silver crucifix. Below
the circular rim, attach a round, hollow
bar of silver, about one inch in diameter
and three inches long. It will serve as
a stem to hold the reliquary by, or as a
foot which may be inserted into an opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">[779]</a></span>
fitted to receive it. The reliquary
may thus be kept upright, whether it be
placed on a stand on the altar or put
away in its armory. This reliquary is
strong and plain, with very little ornamentation
on the silver, but that, they
say, in very good style. Inside this
frame, or case, or reliquary, between the
front and rear glass, and perfectly visible
through them, stand two <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampullæ</i> or vials
of glass, both fastened to the silver rim
at top and at bottom by rough, irregular
masses of dark soldering. They are held
to be the identical glass vials in which a
portion of the blood of St. Januarius was
poured at the time of his martyrdom,
which were laid in his tomb, and, in 385,
were brought with his body to Naples,
and which have ever since been carefully
and reverently preserved. They are of
the old Roman patterns and material.
One may see hundreds of just such vials
in the museums of Naples and Rome.
One of them is long and narrow, like a
modern vial, yet not so even and symmetrical.
The neck, too, does not narrow
in the manner of modern vials. A
fillet runs three or four times round it
just below the neck. Perhaps it was an
ornament; more probably it was intended
by the maker to prevent the little
vial from slipping when held between
the fingers. The other <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i> or vial
is of a different pattern. Its height is the
same; the neck is a little higher up, and
is encircled by a single fillet of an undulating
curvature. The lower portion
swells out until it is two inches in diameter,
and the vial would hold, I judge,
about a gill and a-half. In the interior
of the first <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i>, I saw two patches
resembling the pellicle which I had seen,
at Rome, left on the inner surface of the
glass vases after the martyrs' blood originally
contained in them had entirely
evaporated or passed away. The other
vial, <span class="smcap lowercase">THE AMPULLA</span>, contains a substance
ordinarily hard, dark, with a reddish or
purple hue, and filling ordinarily three-fourths
of the space within the vial, perhaps
a little more. This substance is
held to be a portion of the blood of St.
Januarius, still retained in this vial, in
which it was originally placed on September
19, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 305.</p>

<p>In this description of the reliquary and
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampullæ</i>, I have, of course, summed
up the result of all the careful and scrutinizing
observations which I had the
opportunity of making. I have not been
able to learn when this silver reliquary or
case was made. No entry is found settling
the point, as in the case of the bust.
The style of ornamentation on the silver
case and on the crown would indicate
about the same epoch of art. But I am
inclined to think it the earlier made of
the two. Charles of Anjou showed himself
to be too liberal in the matter of the
bust to be suspected of being a niggard
in preparing the reliquary, and those
coming after him would have felt bound
to be guided by the example of his liberality.
It was probably made some time
before the year 1300, possibly even by
Roger, King of Sicily, who visited Naples
about <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1140.</p>

<p>But to go back. As the chaplain took
the reliquary out from the armory, he examined
it, and said, "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">E duro e pieno</i>"&mdash;"<i>It
is hard and full.</i>" In fact, the larger vial,
as he showed the reliquary round to each
one of the eight or ten persons behind the
altar, and as I most clearly saw it, was
filled to the very top, I could not be mistaken
in that; but whether the contents
were liquid or solid, I really could not
tell. For the very fulness prevented any
change being visible, at least to my eyes,
in that uniformly dark mass, even if the
contents were liquid, although the reliquary
was moved freely from side to side,
held horizontally, or even reversed. After
we had each one venerated and fully
examined the reliquary, the canon, with
his attendants bearing torches, bore it in
procession to the front of the altar, and
showed it aloft to the people. I followed
immediately behind, and ascended the
steps of the altar with them. On the
platform in front of the altar, we were
four: 1. The chaplain, holding the reliquary
in his hands by the stem I have
spoken of. He stood facing the altar, or
leaning over it, between the middle and
the Gospel end, where now stood the
bust. 2. In front of the bust, and close
to the first chaplain, on his left, stood a
second chaplain, bearing a lighted taper
in a silver hand candlestick. He would
sometimes hold this in such a position,
eight or ten inches off from the reliquary
and behind it, that the light from it would
shine on the interior, so that the observer
would not be troubled by the reflection
of the ordinary light from the surface of
the plate of glass next to him. 3. Count
C&mdash;&mdash;, the city delegate, stood at the right
of the first chaplain, and, therefore, in
front of the middle of the altar. It is his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_780" id="Page_780">[780]</a></span>
sworn duty not to lose sight of the precious
reliquary from the moment the doors
of the armory are opened at nine <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, until
it is replaced there, and duly locked up,
about half an hour after sunset. He
cannot retire from his post at any time,
unless his place is supplied by an alternate
delegate, who has been chosen, and
who, I was told, had promised to come by
11 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> 4. Next to Count C&mdash;&mdash;, I stood,
or rather knelt, until the people crowded
so on me that I positively had not room
to continue in that position.</p>

<p>The people, now that the Mass had
been over for twenty minutes or so, had
entered the sanctuary, or had been introduced
into it. They completely filled
the space within the rails; they stood
crowded on the steps; they even invaded
the platform itself, not a very large one,
forcing the attendant chaplains, who had
borne the torches in the procession, and
who now remained to join with the two
chaplains at the altar in the prayers, to
retire somewhat, and kneel in a group, off
at the end of the altar; forced the count
and myself of necessity to stand; and just
left a little room for the two chaplains to
turn in, barely sufficient.</p>

<p>As I stood up, I could see the crowd.
The chapel was filled; there are, you
know, no pews or seats in Italian churches;
all were standing as closely as possible
together. The sanctuaries of the side
chapels were equally crowded; men stood
on the steps and platforms of their altars;
the very bases of the columns were turned
to account to afford a lofty standing room.
And such a crowd! Earnest, intensest
curiosity was marked on every face. The
way it mingled with awe and devotion
was at times rather ludicrous. Hands
were clasped in prayer, and heads were
bowed, and the lips were reciting something
most devoutly; when up the head
would be almost jerked, eye-glasses, spectacles,
and, a little further off, opera-glasses
and lorgnettes would be levelled
at the reliquary for a minute or two;
and then down with them, and again at
the prayers. There were Frenchmen,
Germans, Englishmen, Spaniards, and
Americans; strangers of every nation.
And these had made their way, of course,
closest to the altar; at least they predominated
in my vicinity. In the body
of the chapel, the Neapolitans and Italians
stood. The crowd reached to the railing
under the grand archway, and beyond
that filled the west aisle of the cathedral
church, and stretched across the nave and
the east aisle to the chapels opposite.
The last stood nearly eighty yards off.</p>

<p>These Neapolitans, too full of faith
and brimful of devotion on this day, and
always exceedingly demonstrative in their
manner, gave full way to their feelings,
and were praying aloud or nearly so.
The common people of Naples have a
habit of modulating their voices while
speaking, running up and down the
gamut in a way quite novel to us. You
heard those tones, not inharmonious,
from the thousands who were praying in
various pitches. Some were in groups,
chanting or half-singing the litanies;
some groups were reciting the rosary
devoutly; others united in the acts of
faith, hope, and charity; and still others
in prayers and hymns appropriate for this
occasion, and in their own Neapolitan
dialect. To me it seemed a perfect Babel.
But no one could for an instant look on
them, and doubt the earnestness of their
faith and the intensity of their devotion.</p>

<p>My attention was soon drawn to one
group, or rather line, of a score of elderly
women, from 50 to 80 years of age, strung
along outside the sanctuary railing, from
the centre door of it to the Gospel end.
They all joined in one chorus. They all
spoke so loudly, their tones were so
earnest and modulated, and their position
made them so prominent, that I asked
who they were. I was told they were the
ancient matrons of certain families in
Naples who have ever claimed to be the
blood-relatives of the saint; and, by right
of prescription and usage, they occupy
that position along the altar-rails on occasions
of the exposition of the relics.
They were evidently poor, very poor. It
touched me to see here a dignity of
descent claimed and recognized far beyond
that based on wealth or worldly
position&mdash;a dignity which nobles might
crave in vain, and yet from which their
poverty and daily drudgery do not
debar these simple souls. I said they
were old. Among them and close to
them stood younger women and girls,
other members, I presume, of their families,
who at present prayed in lower tones,
inaudible, or, at least, not noticeable,
in the crowd of subdued voices When
they become grandmothers, I presume
they will take more prominent positions,
and feel privileged to pitch their voices
in shriller tones. I thought at first there
was one exception. I heard a clear, bell-like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">[781]</a></span>
treble voice, which generally led
their chorus of litanies or prayers, and
which never seemed to tire. But I was
mistaken in the supposition. I at last
traced the voice. It was that of an elderly
woman who will scarcely see sixty again.
She stood in the line, tall, thin, emaciated.
Her brow was lofty; her eyes clear, and
blazing with animation; her cheeks
sunken in, not a tooth left; and, as she
spoke, her broad chin seemed to work up
and down a full inch. She wore a clean,
old, faded calico gown, without any starch
in it; and around her head was wound,
like a turban, a bright, stiffened, red and
yellow bandanna, reminding me somewhat
of the respectable colored <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">maumas</i>
I had seen in the South. Her voice was
clear and sweet, and she made free use
of it. Others might tire, or rest, or suspend
their clamorous prayers for a while;
but she, no, she never tired, and her voice
was ever heard among the rest, like a
clear trumpet stop in a full organ. It was
delightful, at last, to watch her occasionally,
as she kept her eyes fixed on the
bust of the saint on the altar, and every
feature of her countenance kept changing
to express the sense of her words. Were
she not in church, her hands and arms
and whole body, I am sure, would have
joined in the movements. As it was, she
confined herself to bowing her head, or
turning it slowly from side to side, yet
always keeping her eyes fixed on the
altar. I had seen, many times, earnest,
silent, tearful prayer. Here I witnessed
equally earnest, <i>noisy</i> prayer. I might
come to like it, but only after some time
and after many trials.</p>

<p>While this universal hubbub of prayer
was filling the church, the chaplain, still
holding the reliquary in his hands by the
stem beneath, bent over the altar, and,
with the other chaplains and those of the
bystanders who joined in, recited the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</i> and other psalms, and the Athanasian
Creed, and various prayers. His
face glowed with the intensity of his feelings.
He kept his eyes earnestly fixed
on the reliquary, from time to time moving
it over from side to side, and examining
it. Sometimes he rubbed the glass
face, front or rear, as necessary, with his
white pocket-handkerchief, that he might
see more clearly the interior. Sometimes
the other chaplain held the candle in a
proper position to aid his inspection. In
about five minutes, he turned round with
the reliquary to the people, and held it
up, with the candle behind it, that all
might see. He let those near look as
scrutinizingly as they wished, reached it
to each one of the ten or fifteen on the
platform and upper steps to kiss it, and,
if they chose, as, of course, they did, to
examine it, at six or ten inches distance.
He then turned to the altar as before, and
the litany of the saints was recited, with
some other prayers. In about five minutes
more, he again turned towards the people,
and gave the immediate bystanders another
opportunity to examine the reliquary
closely as before. Then again to
the altar for other psalms, hymns, and
prayers. This alternation of prayers at
the altar, holding the reliquary near the
bust, and of presentations of it to the bystanders
and the crowd, every five minutes
or so, continued for over half an hour.
But no change was visible. Once he left
the altar, and making his way&mdash;I could
not imagine how&mdash;into the crowd outside
the sanctuary in the body of the chapel,
gave to those to the right and left of his
route a similar opportunity. On another
occasion, he went down again; but this
time he turned to the right, and went
along the line of "relatives." How their
fervor increased, how their demonstrations
became more energetic, their words
more rapid, their chorus fuller, their
voices louder and shriller! He came
back; but still no change. The alternations
continued as before.</p>

<p>At last, a little after ten o'clock, I saw
a change. I think I was the very first to
perceive it. On all the previous times
and up to this, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i> or vial was
perfectly full, as I had seen it when first
taken out of the armory. I now noticed
a faint streak of light between the substance
in the vial and the top, or, rather,
the mass of solder into which the top of
the vial entered. I was sure it had not
been there before. I could scarcely see
it now. This time, as on several other
occasions, the chaplain came twice or
thrice around the ring of immediate bystanders,
those at first in front courteously
giving way that others might in
turn come forward. But I, of course,
retained my place. As he came round
the second time, and approached me
again&mdash;I was within the line or semi-circle&mdash;I
saw that the streak of light was
now clear and unmistakable. It caught
the eye of an earnest little Frenchman
who, for the last half-hour, had been
pressing against me, at times rather inconveniently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">[782]</a></span>
He burst right out: "Don't
you see the light in it? It is changing!
It is liquefying!" The chaplain now
looked at it attentively, moved it from
side to side a little, rubbed the glasses
with his white handkerchief, looked again,
but went round the circle of bystanders a
third time. Again he examined it. By
this time the streak of light had become
half an inch broad. He moved the reliquary
from side to side slowly. We saw
the vacancy now left above yield and follow
his motions, just as the air-bubble
does in a spirit-level, clearly showing the
contents of the vial to be <i>now perfectly
liquid</i>. Some looked on in silent awe;
some shed tears; some cried out, "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Miracolo!
miracolo!</i>" The chaplain waved his
white handkerchief in signal that it really
was so. Rose-leaves in quantities were
thrown up from the crowd outside the
sanctuary, and rained down on us. A
dozen little birds that had been held captive
in the baskets with the roses were
liberated, and rose circling upwards to
the windows of the dome. The grand
organ burst out in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>. The
vast crowd with one voice took up the
hymn, almost drowning the full tones of
the instrument. The bells of the cathedral
tower, in full chimes, sent the announcement
over the city, and the hills and
valleys around, and over the quiet waters
of the beautiful bay. All the bells of the
other churches of Naples chimed in, and
quickly the cannons of the Castle of Sant'
Elmo joined in the chorus with a grand
national salute.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, hundreds were approaching
the altar to see with their own eyes
that the blood was liquid, and to venerate
the relics. Another chaplain now relieved
the first, and continued to present the
reliquary to those who were crowding up.
I still retained my position. The blood
continued to diminish in volume, until it
sank so as to be a full half-inch below
the neck of the vial. It was perfectly
liquid, and, when the reliquary was turned
or inclined, it ran off the up-raised sides
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i> at once leaving no more
trace behind than would so much water.</p>

<p>After half an hour or so, the bust and
the reliquary were carried in procession
out from the chapel into the cathedral.
The procession moved down the western
aisle towards the doors of the church,
turned into the grand nave, and advanced
up to the sanctuary. The bust was placed
on the high altar, and the canons of the
cathedral replaced the chaplains of the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i> chapel in the duty of presenting
the reliquary to the people, as they approached
in undiminished numbers to
venerate and inspect it.</p>

<p>At eleven, I said Mass at the altar where
I had witnessed the liquefaction. After
the Mass, I went into the church, and
spent another half-hour there. Thousands
pouring in from the streets were
still flowing in a constant stream towards
the high altar. A little after twelve, I
left....</p>

<p>Next morning, I said Mass again on
the same altar at eight <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, and before nine
o'clock was again at the doors of the
armories. Count C&mdash;&mdash; came punctually
with his bag of keys. So did the little
canon on the part of the archbishop. I
was told that the sacred relics had remained
exposed all day, after I left, on
the high altar of the cathedral, the blood
remaining liquid all the time; and that,
about dark, they had, according to rule,
been brought back to the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i> chapel,
and had been locked up, as usual, for the
night, in the armories. This morning,
they were to be again brought out. Count
C&mdash;&mdash; and the canon used their keys just
as yesterday. The bust was taken out,
and carried in procession to the front of
the altar, as before. Then the other
armory was opened, and the reliquary
was taken out by the chaplain. "It is
hard, and at its ordinary level," he said,
and showed it to us. The blood now
stood in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i>, not, as yesterday,
filling it, but reaching only to about an
inch below the neck, leaving about one-fourth
of the space within unoccupied.
It was certainly solid and hard; for he
turned the reliquary to one side and the
other without its moving at all. He even
held the reliquary upside down, and the
blood remained a firm and unmoved
mass, attached to the bottom of the now
up-turned <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i>. It was carried to the
altar. We stationed ourselves just as
yesterday. The sanctuary was filled with
visitors, but not so crowded as on the
former occasion. The chapel, too, was
not so densely jammed. None were
forced to stand out in the church for
want of room. The "relatives" were at
their post, and prayed just as before;
but the miracle having occurred on the
feast itself, they were satisfied that it
would occur, as a matter of course, each
day of the exposition throughout the
octave. At least, so I read their countenances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">[783]</a></span>
which were less nervously anxious
than yesterday.</p>

<p>The chaplain commenced the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Miserere</i>,
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deus tuorum militum</i>, and sundry
prayers, the clergy joining in. Every five
minutes or so, he turned to show the reliquary
to the people, especially, of course,
to those immediately around the altar.</p>

<p>In just sixteen minutes after we had
reached the altar, the first symptom of the
coming change showed itself. As the
chaplain held the reliquary for a moment
completely reversed, and steady in that
position, I noticed that the surface of the
blood within the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i>, now, as he held
it, underneath, showed a tendency to sag
downwards, as if it were softening. Soon
again, I saw that around the edge, where
it touched the glass, it had changed color,
and was of a brighter red than in the
middle, and seemed very soft, almost
liquid. In fact, as he would incline the
reliquary to one side or another, the
entire mass within began soon gradually
to slide down and occupy the lowest
position. Still, though soft, it was thick,
and could scarcely be called liquid. Then,
in two or three minutes more, it became
still softer, until it was quite liquid, with
a lump, nevertheless, which seemed to
remain hard and to float in the liquid
portion. To-day, as the glass was moved,
the liquid would run off, of course. But,
whereas yesterday it left the glass quite
clear and clean, as water would do, now,
on the contrary, it left a reddish thick
tinge behind, which only slowly sank
down into the general mass. After a
while, too, the blood seemed to froth, or
show bubbles on its surface&mdash;<i>to boil</i>, as
the Italians say. I remained over half
an hour more to see it, and I noticed that
at the end of that time the lump had disappeared,
and all was quite liquid. The
frothing continued.</p>

<p>After this, I was invited to go into the
sacristy, where they showed me the
superb ecclesiastical vestments belonging
to the chapel&mdash;the mitres, necklaces,
chalices, ciboriums, ostensories, and other
rich jewelry&mdash;in great part, the gifts of
emperors, kings, and other nobles and
wealthy ones, who, for centuries past,
have given them as offerings to this sanctuary
on occasion of their visits. Finally,
I had to tear myself away. Returning
for a few moments to the chapel, I
found the crowds still approaching the
altar to examine and to venerate the
relics.</p>

<p>Reluctantly I left the cathedral, and in
a few hours a railway-train was bearing
me fast and far away from Naples.</p>

<p>I have thus, my dear S&mdash;&mdash;, set forth
minutely and at length what I saw. They
say that in the liquid blood one may still
sometimes see a small fragment of straw
floating about. If so, it must have been
taken up with the blood when it was
gathered at the execution of the saint,
and must have glided unperceived into
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ampulla</i> when the blood was poured
into it that day. A young friend with me
thought he caught a glimpse of it. His
eyesight is keen, which, you know, mine
is not. Anyhow, I did not see it. I need
not tell you of various other little points
of which the Neapolitans speak, as I had
no opportunity of testing them or verifying
them myself. I have told you, simply
and straightforwardly, what fell under my
own experience.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our readers will not regret the
length of this account of the liquefaction,
so full and minute in the details.
The letter from which we extract
it was written immediately after
the visit of the writer to Naples, from
notes made at the time, and while
the impressions left on his memory
were still fresh.</p>

<p>It was not necessary, in a letter
like that we have made use of, to
enter on the discussion of mooted
points of archæology. The writer
simply sets forth the opinions which,
after more or less of examination, he
felt inclined to adopt. We say here
that there is a difference among writers
as to the year in which the body
of St. Januarius was transferred from
the original sepulchre to the church
of San Gennaro <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">extra muros</i>, and
there is still a graver difference as to
the precise place of the original
tomb. Some have held that the execution
took place on a more elevated
spot on the same hill which the
letter mentions&mdash;about a quarter of
a mile distant from the church of the
Capuchins&mdash;and that this church
marks not the site of the execution,
as the letter holds with the Neapolitan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">[784]</a></span>
archæologists, but the site of the
first temporary interment, from which
the body was borne to Naples, twelve
or fifteen years later than the year
assigned above. These are minor
points, on which we may let antiquaries
argue at pleasure.</p>

<p>In another article, we purpose to
examine the character of the fact of
the liquefaction of the blood of St.
Januarius, according to exact records
of its history for several centuries
back.</p>

<p>For the present, we close with the
latest account of its occurrence which
has fallen under our eye. The <cite>Pall
Mall Budget</cite>, of May 26 last, has the
following: "The blood of St. Januarius
seems to have been lately in
a more perturbed state, if possible,
than ever. The <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Libertà Cattolica</i> of
Naples gives an account of some unusual
appearances presented by this
relic, on the 6th inst., one of the
annual occasions on which the holy
martyr is honored in the cathedral
of Naples. On the day in question,
Saturday, May 6, at a quarter-past
four <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, the reliquary being brought
out of its tabernacle, where it had
remained since the 16th of last December&mdash;the
feast of the patronage&mdash;it
was found partly liquid, as when
laid up. It continued in the same
state during the procession (from the
cathedral to the church of St. Clara),
and, after thirteen minutes of prayers,
the sign of the miracle was given,
the portion which had remained
hard being perceptibly still more dissolved,
so as to show that the miracle
had taken place. Gradually, during
the kissing of the reliquary by
the congregation at St. Clara, it became
entirely dissolved. On its return
to the cathedral, contrary to
what had taken place during the last
few years, it was found to be completely
hardened. When carried into
the chapel of the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Tesoro</i>, it dissolved
anew, and now entirely, yet

<h2>LUCAS GARCIA.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE SPANISH OF FERNAN CABALLERO.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In an age when all impressions are effaced by the double hammer of civilization and incredulity,
it is touching and beautiful to see a people preserve a stable character and immutable
beliefs."</p></blockquote>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Eastward from Jerez, in the direction
of the Sierra de Ronda, which
rises in a succession of terraces, as if
to form a suitable pedestal for the
rightly named San Cristóbal, lie the
extensive Llanos de Caulina. A bare
and uniform road drags itself for two
leagues through the palmettoes, and
makes a halt at the foot of the first
elevation, where a lazy rivulet widens
in the sun, and, stagnating in summer,
changes its waters into mire.</p>

<p>On the right is seen the castle of
Malgarejo, one of the few Moorish
edifices that time and his faithful
auxiliary in the work of destruction,
ignorance, have left standing. Time
makes ruins, groups them, crowns
them with garlands, and adorns them
with verdure, as if he desired to have
them for places of recreation and
rest; but the barbarian ignorance
gives no quarter&mdash;his only delight is
in dust; his place of repose, the desert
waste; his end, nothingness.</p>

<p>The angles of the castle are flanked
by four large towers. These, as
well as the walls of the whole enclosure,
are surmounted by well-formed
turrets, perfect still, and without
notch or break in their beautiful uniformity.
The castle took its name
of Malgarejo from a knight of Jerez,
by whom its reduction was accomplished
in a manner so curious, that
we cannot resist the inclination to
relate it, for the benefit of those who
are unacquainted with the tales of
partisan exploits that abound in the
annals of Jerez.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the thirteenth
century, a hundred and fifty Moors,
with their families, occupied the castle.
They went clothed in white, according
to the custom of their nation,
and mounted gray horses. Shut
up as they were, they procured their
subsistence by foraging the country
at night, and carrying to their stronghold
whatever booty they could seize.</p>

<p>Malgarejo resolved to get possession
of this formidable place. It was
surrounded, at that time, by a wide
moat. This moat&mdash;opened by the
Moors for their protection, and afterward
serving them for a sepulchre&mdash;no
longer exists.</p>

<p>The Christian cavalier had a slave
that was a most accomplished horseman,
and to him he promised liberty
if he would swear to devote himself
to the proposed undertaking. The
slave, agreeing, was entrusted by his
master with a mare of singular agility,
and was directed to train her to
leap a ditch, which was to be enlarged,
by degrees, to the width of
the one that surrounded the Saracen
castle.</p>

<p>This being accomplished, Malgarejo
called together his followers, disguised
them as Moors, caused them
to cover their horses with white
cloths, and, one night, when the garrison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">[786]</a></span>
had sallied out upon a raid, approached
the fortress. Those within,
taking his host for the one they were
expecting, viewed its approach without
suspicion. When the Christians
came nearer, they saw their mistake,
and would have raised the bridge,
but the slave of Malgarejo had already
leaped the moat, and cut the
cords, so that it could not be lifted;
and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Jerezanos</i> made themselves
masters of the castle.</p>

<p>The sight of this stronghold, over
which the destroyer Time has passed
leaving as little trace as would the
footstep of a bird, transports the beholder
to the past with such vividness
of illusion, that he is surprised
not to see the pennon of the half-moon
fluttering above its towers, and
misses a snowy turban from behind
every one of its turrets. No fitter
place could be found for the representation
of a fight or of a tournament
between Moors and Christians.</p>

<p>The road to Arcos leaves on its
left the sleeping stream and the
dead fortress, within whose precinct,
like ants in a skeleton, laborers plying
the tools of peaceful husbandry
are moving.</p>

<p>Ascending this first step of the
mountain, the traveller crosses other
plains, covered as far as the eye can
see with rich harvests, and, finding
no nearer inn or stopping-place, takes
his siesta at the grange of La Peñuela,
formerly the property of the
Carthusian fathers&mdash;an order so pious,
so severe, so worthy and respected,
that the country folk still
ask each other, "And was there indeed
a power that could, and a hand
that would dare to touch such men
and such things?"</p>

<p>As the country rises, it covers itself
with olive groves, as if it would
shelter white and ancient Arcos in
the pride with which she preserves
her title of city, her venerable privileges,
and her state parchments, in
spite of decline, or, better said, in
spite of her still life, in the midst of
the progress that waits upon the
march of time&mdash;a progress at once
gentle, deliberate, and spontaneous.</p>

<p>True to the guerilla traits of her
Moorish founders, Arcos appears to
the traveller, wearied with the ascent,
alternately advancing and retiring,
until, passing between two high rocks,
he enters unexpectedly into a city so
beautiful for situation as to astonish
and delight even those who are rarely
moved by the charms of nature
or the enchantments of the picturesque.</p>

<p>One afternoon, in the year 1840
or thereabout, a crowd of people
might have been seen entering a
poor-looking house in the barrier of
San Francisco. From this house
they had carried, on the previous
day, the body of one who had been
its mistress, and the neighbors were
now uniting for the <i>condolement</i> required
by the rigorous etiquette
which is observed by the people, and
which manifests the instinctive courtesy
and dignity that distinguish them.
For all etiquette and all ceremonial
are founded upon these bases, and
are not the ridiculous and superficial
things, either in public or private
life, that the revolutionary spirit of
the age, and the anxiety to escape
from every rein, material and moral,
would make us believe. Ceremonial
and etiquette, in the right acceptation
of the words, are external conduct,
disposed so as to give worship
to things divine, consideration and
respect to things human.</p>

<p>On entering the house, the women
assembled in the parlor of the mourner's
<i>habitation</i>.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Opposite this room
was another, which had been lent by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">[787]</a></span>a neighbor for the accommodation
of the men.</p>

<p>Upon a mat in the middle of the
apartment first mentioned was extended
a handkerchief, into which
each person, as he entered, threw
one or two copper coins, destined
for the stipend of the Mass of San
Bernardino. This custom is observed
not only among the poor, but
also among those who are well-to-do,
for this Mass must be owed to
charity. Let sceptics and rationalists
explain this as best suits them.
We look upon it as an act of humility,
joined to the desire of uniting
many suffrages. And although we
may be more impressed with terrestrial
honors, such as a splendid funeral,
a showy catafalque, and a proud
mausoleum, the fervent petition of
the heart, the coin given in charity,
the prayers of the church, are better
suffrages for heaven. In a corner of
the room, upon a low chair, was the
principal mourner, a little girl of
eight years. Wearied with weeping
for her mother, and with remaining
so long in one position, she had
leaned her head against the back of
the chair, and fallen asleep&mdash;for
sleep is a lover of children, and hastens
to their relief whenever they
suffer in body or spirit.</p>

<p>"Poor Lucia," said one of the
mourners, a kinswoman of the deceased,
glancing at the child, "how
she will miss her mother!"</p>

<p>"This was the thorn that poor Ana
carried to the grave fastened in her
heart," observed a neighbor.</p>

<p>"But," asked another, "of what
did she die?"</p>

<p>"Only the ground that covers her
knows what ailed her," answered
the relative, "for Ana did not complain.
If she had not been so thin,
you might have drunk her; as yellow
as a waxen flower, and so weak that
a shadow could have knocked her
down, no one would have thought
that she was on her way to Holyfield."</p>

<p>"She died of a broken heart!" exclaimed
an energetic-looking young
matron; "all the world knows it; and
because we have an alcalde that is
afraid to strap his breeches to the
work and cast out of town with the
devil's sling these trulls of strangers
who come among us to set up drinking-houses,
and chouse married men,
to their perdition and the ruins
of their families!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, the alcaldes have eyes
of fishes for all these things," said the
relative of the deceased, "just as they
have owls' eyes for some others. But
they'll get their pay, woman; for
though God consents, 'tis not for
ever!"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the first&mdash;"consents
to the death of the good, and
lets the bad live, and crow on. God
reserves the justice of heaven for
himself. The rod of earthly justice
he puts into the hands of men; and
a fine account they'll have to give
of the way they use it! I'd like to
break the one our alcalde carries
upon his shoulders!"</p>

<p>"Neighbor," said an old woman,
"you are more hasty than a spark
from the forge; you attack like the
bulls, with eyes shut. Think whom
you are speaking of; and bear in mind
that 'evil wounds heal, but evil
fame kills.' Poor Ana was never
well after her last confinement.
Death does not come without a pretext:
the summer pulled her down,
and September finished her; for
'from friar to friar,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> God be our
guard!'"</p>

<p>"Of course, Aunt Maria," retorted
the young woman, "it's quite proper
for you, because you are aunt to
Juan Garcia, and cousin to the alcalde,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">[788]</a></span>to say so; for 'with reason or
without it, aid us God and our kin.'
But I tell you that my José is not to
set his foot inside of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Leona's</i><a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
gin-shop; and I'll see that he don't!
A man may be as honest as Job,
but in 'the house of the soap-maker
he that doesn't fall slips.' And say
what you please, you who are a
widow, with the coolness of age in
your veins, I shall not go back of
what I have said. 'He that jumps
straight, falls on his feet,' and I say,
and resay it: they ought to flay
alive the good-for-nothing calamary
of a she-sergeant, with her sentry-box
figure, and face darker than an
oil-skin, so full of pock-marks that it
looks as if she had fallen into a bed
of chick-peas, and more hair on
her lip than a grenadier! Remember
the proverb, 'Salute the bearded
woman at a distance!'"</p>

<p>"And her children," said the mourner&mdash;"little
imps that she keeps so
greasy and neglected! They look
like a nest of calamaries."</p>

<p>"But she thinks them little suns,"
added another.</p>

<p>"Ya!" exclaimed the first who
had spoken; "said the black beetle
to her young ones, 'Come hither,
my flowers!' and the owl calls
hers 'drops of gold.' Who ever
saw such a thing, sirs," she continued,
growing excited&mdash;"who ever
saw anything so wicked as to dupe
a married man, the father of children,
ruin him, pull down his house,
and murder his wife by inches! And
this is known and permitted! I tell
you, such a thing sinks deep!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is worse than stabbing
with a knife," exclaimed one woman.</p>

<p>"It cries to God!" added another.</p>

<p>"It is a scandal of the monstrous
kind," proceeded the first. "Poor
Ana, though I did not see much of
her, I loved her well. Almond-paste
is not milder than she was, and as
meek and free from malice as a sheep
in the hands of the butcher. O
men! men! There is a curse on
them that pull their clothes on over
their feet; and that is the reason our
dear Lord would not wear breeches,
but always dressed in a tunic."</p>

<p>"Come, daughter," said Aunt Maria,
"nothing is mended by malediction,
nor by spitting out the quinine.
Let us pray for the soul of the departed,
for that is what will really
benefit her."</p>

<p>These words were the signal for
complete silence. Aunt Maria took
her rosary, the rest following her example,
and, after saying the act of
contrition and a solemn credo, proceeded
to recite the rosary of souls,
repeating three times after the Paternoster,
and instead of the Hail
Mary,</p>

<p class="center">
"O Lord, by thy infinite mercy,"<br />
</p>

<p>the others answering in chorus,</p>

<p class="center">
"Grant to the souls of the faithful departed peace and glory."<br />
</p>

<p>Nothing was now heard in the
mourning room of the women but
the grave murmur of the prayers and
suppressed sighs of pity and sorrow.</p>

<p>The other parlor presented a very
different spectacle. The widower, serene
as a glass of water, and cool as a
fresh lettuce, now that the day of the
burial had passed, considered himself
dispensed from the attitude of mourning,
and smoked, listening and talking
to all, just as usual, as if death
had entered his house and departed
without leaving either trace or impression
of his awful presence.</p>

<p>The indifferent ones followed his
example, so that, had not all worn
cloaks, no one would have supposed
that this was a condolement, a tribute
of love and respect to a life that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">[789]</a></span>
had ended, and of sympathy with an
overwhelming sorrow. The only
figure that appeared to be in harmony
with the object of the reunion
was that of a boy thirteen years old,
the son of the deceased, who sat
near his father with his elbows resting
on his knees, and his face buried
in his hands, weeping inconsolably.</p>

<p>"What kind of day has it been?"
asked the widower.</p>

<p>"Unhealthy," answered one.</p>

<p>"And the sky?"</p>

<p>"Patched; I think the rain is not
far off. There was fog this morning,
and 'fog is the rain's sponsor and
the sun's neighbor.'"</p>

<p>"The wind will soon sweep the
cobwebs from the sky," said a third,
"for it blows from sunset side. The
rain is shyer than sixpences."</p>

<p>"No matter," answered the first,
"last year it did not rain till All
Saints; and a better year, or another
of the same piece, hasn't been seen
since the creation. Laborers, farmers,
and tenants all got tired of gathering,
and had more than enough&mdash;the
barley, in particular, grew so
thick that you couldn't set a spade
between the blades."</p>

<p>"The month of January is the
key of the year. If the sky does not
open in January, there will be no
harvest."</p>

<p>"Hola! Uncle Bartolo!" all exclaimed,
as a small, vigorous old man
entered the apartment. "Where do
you hail from? where have you been
ever since we missed you from
here?"</p>

<p>Uncle Bartolo, after offering to
the mourner the usual condolences,
seated himself, and, turning toward
his interrogators, replied:</p>

<p>"Where do I come from? The
district of Doñana, without varying
from the most direct line. Since the
French war ended, and I took the
road, I have been water-carrier<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> to
the <i>You Sirs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> They have them there
in Doñana of all complexions&mdash;legitimate,
grafted, cross-breed, and supposititious,
even English. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Caballeros!</i>
Deliver us; but those Swiss of the
French are the ones! Stout fellows;
very white; very ruddy; very fair-haired,
and very puffy. But as to
spirit, they have no more than they
drink; and grace, they have not any.
They carry their arms like the sleeves
of a capote, and set their feet down
like pestles. Whenever I saw those
feet that resembled <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">jabeques</i>,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> I used
to say to myself,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A good foot and good ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Signs of a good beast are.'<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For talking, they make use of a
kind of jargon that, in my opinion,
they themselves don't understand.
These parleys that I don't comprehend
displease me, for I never know
whether I am being bought or sold.</p>

<p>"There was one&mdash;the size of a
tunny-fish&mdash;they called Don 'Turo.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
He fell to me. To see him blowing
and sweating over those sands made
one pity him, for a league finishes
them; the sun offends them; the
heat makes them weak, and dissolves
them entirely. That platter face
would persist in doing everything
contrariwise, as they do it in his
country. Once he took it into his
head to use my clasp-knife to eat
with, and cut himself. With that he
got out a medicine-chest as big as a
surgeon's. 'Go along!' said I to
myself, 'a spider bit me, and I bound
the wound up in a sheet.' He was
as hard-headed as a corner. Another
time he made up his mind that he
ought to shoot a partridge, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">[790]</a></span>though I told him it was against the
law to shoot partridges at that season,
he fired, and would have fired if his
father had stood before the mouth of
his gun. He fired and killed an urraca.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
'Sir,' said I, 'what has your
honor done?' Says he to me, 'Killed
the partridge.' 'Why, sir, it isn't
a partridge, it's an urraca.' 'It's
all right,' said the big bungler, quite
composedly. 'But it is not right,'
answered I; 'the killing of urracas
is prohibited.' 'And who prohibits
it?' he asked, putting on his face of a
lion. 'I have my license, that cost
me three thousand reals.' 'But, sir,
that is for large game&mdash;you understand?
The urracas mustn't be
killed. You comprehend?' Says he
to me, 'In this country of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Santísima
María</i>'&mdash;for, as I have told you already,
he said everything reversed,
as they do in his&mdash;'in this country
there's no end of privileges, and do
the very urracas have them?'</p>

<p>"That question was so foolish, or
else meant to be ironical, that I didn't
care to set him right; so I told him,
'Yes, privileges that were granted to
them in very ancient times, by <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Doña
Urraca</i> herself.' He took out a blank-book
and wrote that down. 'Let
the ball roll,' said I in my jacket, 'it
isn't my business to stop it.'"</p>

<p>"But, Uncle Bartolo, why may they
not kill urracas in the district?"
asked a young man.</p>

<p>"Because they are the ones that
planted the pine woods," answered
Uncle Bartolo.</p>

<p>"Oh! none of that! you are not
talking to platter-face," replied the
youth.</p>

<p>"So I perceive, since his swallow
for novelties was too big; and you&mdash;for
a blockhead of those who believe
only what they see&mdash;haven't any.
Nevertheless, sir, that the urracas do
plant the pines is a truth as evident
as a house. They open the ripe
cones, and pick out the seeds for food.
Being very saving birds, they bury
those that they can't eat; and, being
very brainless ones, they forget all
about it and never go back to look
for them; and the seeds sprout. If
it were not true, why would the
dukes prohibit the killing of urracas,
when they are thicker in the district
than sparrows on a threshing-floor?
Therefore, Alonso, no one may say,
'This camel can't enter the eye of my
needle'; for, of two silly birds, the
one that always keeps his bill shut is
more silly than the one that has his
always open. But you were a dunce
from the beginning; and, as you
grow older, you are gaining upon
Blas, that ate horse-beans."</p>

<p>"And at night, uncle, what did
those people do with themselves
there in the province?" asked the
listeners.</p>

<p>"The Englishmen ate and drank,
for their honors are made hollow, in
order that they may always be putting
things into their mouths. That is
the reason they are so fat and big.
Platter-face told me one day&mdash;with
an air as if God had just revealed it
to him&mdash;that I was able to go so
long without getting tired because I
was lean; and that he would give a
thousand dollars, or some such sum,
to be as lean as I. I answered&mdash;shouting
to make him understand
better&mdash;'Your worship has only to
eat <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">gazpacho</i><a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> to dry up your flesh,
and raw onions and garlic to sharpen
your senses."</p>

<p>"And the Spaniards&mdash;how did they
pass the evenings, Uncle Bartolo?"</p>

<p>"The Spaniards? Talking through
the very stitches of their garments;
bawling till you would have thought
they were echoes: and quarrelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">[791]</a></span>about things of the government. For,
nowadays, everybody wants to
know everything himself, and to command:
the very beetles set up their
tails and complain of a cough. I tell
you, sirs, there are no more such
Spaniards as there were in the time of
the French war. We were as one man
then, and all of one mind. Now
there are moderates and <i>extremists</i>. I,
who am an <i>extremist</i> only when it
concerns my gun, my wife, and my
children, could wish the devil would
fly away with so much gab. It made
me want to say to them: 'Gentlemen,
where there is less tongue, count on
more judgment,' and 'so much grass
chokes the wheat.'"</p>

<p>"One night, one of the <i>You Sirs</i>
called me, and wanted to know if I
was in the war against Napoleon.
'Yes, sir,' I answered, 'I was a
guerilla.' 'Well, then,' said he, 'you
just come here, for I am going to
read you the will he made.'"</p>

<p>"What! did that man make a will,
Uncle Bartolo?" asked some of the
oldest of the listeners.</p>

<p>"Yes, and before he died, it is
supposed.</p>

<p>"'But, your worship,' I asked,
'what had that kingdom-thief to
give away? Did they not then make
him throw up everything he had
taken?'</p>

<p>"The <i>You Sir</i> had an open book,
and began to read. Gentlemen, that
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">soccarron</i>,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> in his will, went on distributing
everything, his goods, his
arms, his body, and his heart. I was
perplexed. 'Well, what do you
think of it, uncle?' said his honor,
when he had ended. 'Sir,' I
answered, 'from what I can see,
that unbeliever thought of everything;
but neither in his life nor in
his death did he remember his soul.'"</p>

<p>"Why did you join the guerillas,
Uncle Bartolo?" asked one of the
company.</p>

<p>"What a question!" exclaimed
the guerilla, looking at the one who
had asked it, and weaving himself
backwards and forwards with much
composure.</p>

<p>"'He that asks does not err,'
Uncle Bartolo."</p>

<p>"Yes, but this is a case of 'He
that asks does not err, and I ask if
they bury the dead with the deceased?'"</p>

<p>"What I mean is, when did you
leave your house, and how did you
happen to fall in with the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">partida</i>?"<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>"Ya! those are other questions,
Lopez. Some French horsemen
came here&mdash;they call them <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">colaseros</i>
(cuirassiers)&mdash;my wife was more
afraid of them than of a contagion,
and every time she heard the clarionets,
she would say to me, in a
fright, 'They are sounding the charge.'
'No, wife,' I would tell her, 'they
are sounding the <i>premonition</i>.' One
day the cornet&mdash;they used to call
him <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trompi</i>&mdash;came in tipsy, and insulted
my wife. I, who was not
afraid of any three that might come,
and never stopped to think of consequences,
said to him, 'Out of here,
little soul of a pitcher, and Barabbas
cut a slice from you!' With that
he drew his sword, and would have
cut me, but I snatched my knife, and
finished him at once; and then,
catching up mantle and blanket, took
the wind for the mountains. I stopped
in Benamahoma with the Padre
Lovillo&mdash;and there you have it all."</p>

<p>"The Padre Lovillo was the captain
of the partida?" questioned a
youth.</p>

<p>"Yes, the Padre Lovillo. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Candela!</i>
That was a man you could call a
man! No talker&mdash;not he; but the
words he used were few and good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">[792]</a></span>If any one wanted to brag of his
doings, he would say, 'Let them be
seen, not heard. You understand,
cackler? Stabs with steel, not with
the tongue; balls of lead, not of
wind.' Sirs, that man was ready for
everything, as you would have declared
with two tongues if you had
had them. When we were going to
attack the French, he used to say,
'Listen, sons, our fathers died for
their country, and we are not to be
less than they.' Then, drawing his
sword, he would shout, '<em>Now</em> let us
see who has pluck!' and charge like
another Santiago,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and we after him,
as if he had led us to Paris in France.
We felt neither hunger nor weariness;
it was a fight without drum or
trumpet, but it made the Frenchmen
shiver. They named us the '<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Briganes</i><a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
of the Black Mountain,' and
were more afraid of us than of the
trained soldiery.</p>

<p>"Don 'Turo, who knew that I had
been a <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">brigan</i>, called me into the
parlor one evening, and, when he
had squeezed himself into a chair,
told me to sit down. I began to
wonder where all these Masses were
going to end.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Surely, I thought,
he cannot want me to clean his gun!
But I waited for the mountain to
bring forth, and presently he asked
me to explain the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">trafica</i><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> of guerilla
fighting. When I saw him come
out with that ladder, I got angry,
and told him, 'No;' that my pronouncing
was very bad, and his understanding
worse. But all the
others insisted, and, not to seem
disobliging, I repeated a very good
and well-versed poem, that was going
the rounds then."</p>

<p>"And what was it about, Uncle
Bartolo?"</p>

<p>"It relates a conversation between
Malapart<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> and that Indian, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Munrá</i>,
Duke of <i>Ver</i>."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>"Go on, uncle, say it," exclaimed
all present.</p>

<p>The following romance, which the
old guerilla recited, was very popular
at that time among the people.
It owes its humor to the fact that
neither its unlettered composer, nor
those who recited it, had any suspicion
that they were giving a caricature.
They considered it a simple
and probable account of what would
take place between Napoleon and
Murat when they saw their last
troops vanquished. Even the conclusion
is in no way inconsistent
with their ideas of the antecedents
and characters of the personages:</p>

<p>"And which did he do, uncle?"
asked one&mdash;"sweep chimneys or
grind scissors?"</p>

<p>"<i>He sweep chimneys!</i>" exclaimed
Uncle Bartolo. "Such people always
fall into feather-beds! They
carried him to St. Helena&mdash;beyond
Gibraltar&mdash;where he had it quite
comfortable till he died raving, after
the devil had helped him to make
that will."</p>

<p>"Here comes Uncle Cohete," said
a man who sat by the window.</p>

<p>"Make him a sign to come in,"
said the person nearest him, in a low
tone.</p>

<p>Uncle Cohete was a simple, good
old man, who acted the merry-andrew
for the purpose of obtaining
alms for a religious house of which
he was <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">demandante</i>.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> He could mimic
to perfection the songs of all
birds; the near and distant barking
of the dog, the mewing of the cat;
and so excelled in imitating the peculiar
hiss and crackling of a kite in the
air, as to have obtained the nickname
of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cohete</i> (kite), by which he was
known. He had, besides, a stock of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">[794]</a></span>simple verses, ballads, riddles, and
odd scraps of humor, which he would
repeat with inimitable expression and
drollery. The sources from which
he drew his supplies could not be
told. This, he had learned in a
town on the Llanura; that, in a village
of the Sierra; another at the
fireside of the manse. But, in his
mimicry of the birds, they themselves
had been the teachers, aided by unusual
flexibility of organs, and great
patience and perseverance on the
part of the disciple. For, in all
branches&mdash;whether important or insignificant&mdash;perseverance
yields great
results.</p>

<p>It having been intimated to Uncle
Cohete that the company wished him
to tell something diverting, he began
by saying <i>The Commandments of the
Rich Man and the Poor Man</i>&mdash;a collection
of ironical precepts, which
enjoyed great popularity at that time&mdash;as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The commandments of the rich man,
nowadays, are five, namely:</p>

<p>"The first. Thou shalt have no end of
money.</p>

<p>"The second. Thou shalt despise all
the rest of the world.</p>

<p>"The third. Thou shalt eat good beef
and good mutton.</p>

<p>"The fourth. Thou shalt eat flesh on
Good Friday.</p>

<p>"The fifth. Thou shalt drink both white
wine and red.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"These commandments are included in two:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let all be for me, and nothing for you.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"The commandments of the poor man
are five, namely:</p>

<p>"The first. Thou shalt never have any
money.</p>

<p>"The second. Thou shalt be despised
by all the world.</p>

<p>"The third. Thou shalt eat neither beef
nor mutton.</p>

<p>"The fourth. Thou shalt fast, even if
it be not Good Friday.</p>

<p>"The fifth. Thou shalt taste neither
the white wine nor the red.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"These commandments are included in two:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scratch thyself, and bear everything for the love of God."<br /></span>
</div></div></div></blockquote>

<p>"Uncle, did not the son of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Roba-Santos</i><a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>
who is heaping money, give
you an alms?" asked one.</p>

<p>"No, he gave me nothing," answered
Uncle Cohete.</p>

<p>"Like father, like son," said Uncle
Bartolo.</p>

<p>"Next year, uncle, you will get a
pile, for 'when the fields have, the
saints have.'"</p>

<p>"Uncle Cohete, take these two
coppers, and tell us <i>The Commandments
of the New Law</i>," said the
man who had called him in:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The commandments of the new law
are ten, namely:</p>

<p>"The first. Let there be no money in
Spain.</p>

<p>"The second. Let the world turn upside-down.</p>

<p>"The third. Let every one play gentleman.</p>

<p>"The fourth. Let not a single copper
come from America.</p>

<p>"The fifth. Let there be no end of
drafting.</p>

<p>"The sixth. Let the new law come
from abroad.</p>

<p>"The seventh. Let there be fewer people
that are not wanted.</p>

<p>"The eighth. Let them distribute biscuits
in Navarra.</p>

<p>"The ninth. Let every one look out
for himself.</p>

<p>"The tenth. Let all be at variance.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"These commandments are included in two:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some say yes, and others say no."<br /></span>
</div></div></div></blockquote>

<p>"Tell us a riddle, uncle."</p>

<p>"Fifty ladies and five gallants:
the fifty ask fowl; the five ask bread,"
said the old man, of whom nature,
and the kind of life he led, had made
the personification of ready and good-humored
obedience.</p>

<p>"The Rosary! I knew that," said
a little boy. "Tell another."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">[795]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">"The mantle of Lady Leonor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks in the river, but covers the shore."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"We give it up, uncle."</p>

<p>"It is the snow, gentlemen."</p>

<p>At this moment they were interrupted
by the ringing of the sunset
bell, and, all rising, stood with uncovered
heads.</p>

<p>"Will you recite the prayer, Uncle
Bartolo," said the widower.</p>

<p>Uncle Bartolo repeated the Angelus,
adding a Paternoster for the
deceased. And now the grief of
the sobbing child in the corner broke
forth in bitter crying.</p>

<p>"Stop that, Lucas!" said his father.
"You have been going on in
that way, hic! hic! like an old woman,
for two days. You ought to
have gone into the women's room.
Let me hear you crying again! You
understand?"</p>

<p>"Let me tell <em>you</em>, Juan Garcia,"
said Uncle Bartolo, "that you are
the first man I ever heard rebuke
the tears of a son for his mother!
You see me, with my years, my beard,
and my guerilla life; well, I remember
mine, and weep for her still!</p>

<p>"But, uncle, 'frown, and frown
again, of a bad son makes a good
one.' Lucas here is a regular <i>Marcia
Fernandez</i>,<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> brought up in the
folds of his mother's skirts. I must
teach him that men resist, and do
not allow themselves to be overcome
by tribulations."</p>

<p>Uncle Bartolo shook his head.
"Time and not ointment will cure
the patient. If you had died, his
mother would not have been the one
to rebuke your son for the tears he
shed over you."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Juan Garcia continued his former
life, abandoning himself with more
liberty to the wicked woman of whom
the friends of his dead wife had spoken
at the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">condolement</i>. She was called
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Leona</i> in allusion to her native
island of Leon, where she had
married a sergeant, who was afterward
sent to serve in America. Like
all bad women, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Leona</i> was much
worse than men of the same class,
inasmuch as, in the subtle organization
of woman, the delicacy that
is given to her for good turns into a
refinement of evil, and her instinctive
penetration into malignant sagacity.
Not satisfied with having attracted
to herself Juan Garcia, who possessed
a small patrimony, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">La Leona</i>, impelled
by the bitter envy which a
lost woman feels toward one who is
honest, undertook to render him indifferent
to his wife, and succeeded
not only in this, but also in causing
him to ill-treat and abandon her.
Juan Garcia was a weak man, easily
subjugated by those who knew how
to obtain an influence over him, and,
by way of compensating himself for
this complaisance, very obstinate and
overbearing in his treatment of others.
By degrees, it came to pass
that his mistress would not receive
him with favor unless he brought
her, as an offering, the relation of
some act of coldness or cruelty to
the victim whose only crime was
that of affording, by her right, and
by her silent and prudent endurance,
the most patent condemnation of
the conduct of these two, a condemnation
all the more ignominious
because of the great purity of manners
which prevails in country places.
And in order to gain our assertion
credit with those who are disposed
to accuse us of partiality for the
country people, we hasten to say
that this purity may naturally be attributed
to the wholesome influence
of labor, which, in putting indolence
to flight, puts to flight with it the
vices it generates, and to the blessed
poverty, which, being without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">[796]</a></span>
means of satisfying them, hinders
their birth. Having convinced utilitarians
with these reasons, we will
add to them others of our own;
namely, the salutary ideas of morality
and rooted principles of honor
that many centuries of Catholicism
have fixed in the hearts of these
people&mdash;principles renewed, in each
successive generation, by the unchanging
zeal that is the property
of religion, and that never wearies or
grows lukewarm.</p>

<p>Like all other general rules, the
above has its exceptions. Juan
Garcia furnished one. His unkindness,
united with the grief and shame
his conduct caused her, had certainly
hastened the death of poor
Ana, whose last act of affection as
a wife, and duty as a Christian, had
been to forgive him. Alas! the
soul of the husband was so deeply mired
that even this saintly death could
awaken in it neither pity nor remorse.
Not that he was utterly
perverse, but his eyes, like those of
many another in this world of error,
were covered by one of those veils
which must fall on the day of God's
judgment, when the light of truth
will be the first punishment that
awaits the willingly blind.</p>

<p>His boy and girl remained orphaned
and neglected, and would have been
entirely forsaken but for that active
charity which makes women constitute
themselves fervent protectors of
the helpless and severe judges of
the wrong-doer. The wives of Juan's
neighbors took care of the children,
and obliged him to feed and clothe
them, freely casting in his face his evil
conduct, while, with imperturbable
coolness, they prescribed to him his
obligations.</p>

<p>Ah charity!&mdash;some proclaim and
others comprehend thee; some would
guide thee, and thou guidest others!
Why art thou not found in the palaces
that philanthropy builds for
thee? Why dost thou appear in all
thy brightness in the dwellings of the
poor, delighting thyself with the
widow's farthing? It is because
thou wilt be queen and not a slave!</p>

<p>The children could not be consoled
for the death of their mother.
Isolated as they were, all the sentiments
of their hearts became converted
into love for each other, and
sorrow for their loss.</p>

<p>Lucas, however, who was five
years older than his sister, did his
best to enliven and distract her.</p>

<p>"Don't cry so, Lucia," he said to
her one night, not long after the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">condolement</i>. "Mother will not come
back for crying, and you make me
cry. What shall I do to amuse
you?"</p>

<p>The child made no answer.</p>

<p>"Shall I sing you a romance?"</p>

<p>Lucia inclined her head in token
of assent, and the boy sang in his
clear, sweet voice the following ballad:</p>

<span class="i0">Of our sweet princess Mary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her name she calls.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, homeward in the evening<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good brother turns his feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finds table spread and waiting,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He takes a loaf and breaks it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But throws it away again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For blood runs out of the bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his hand he sees the stain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he takes and breaks another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still the red blood falls&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh! what is this?" astonished,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his trembling wife he calls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tell me, I say! what is it?"<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The window-shutters were closed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But the gleam of many lights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone out through the apertures&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone on six angels of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All kneeling upon the floor<br /></span>

<p>"And did she let her sister starve
to death?" asked the child, her
eyes refilling from her already surcharged
heart.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; she was a good-for-nothing;
but don't cry, Lucia, a
story isn't a thing that ever happened."</p>

<p>"If it had never happened, they
would not have put it in the romance,"
said the little girl.</p>

<p>"They made it up," replied Lucas.
"Don't you believe it, dear.
When I am a man and can earn,
the least piece of bread I may have,
I must divide with my heart's little
sister. You know that before mother
died she put you in my care, and
I made her a promise never to forsake
you."</p>

<p>"And will you keep it?"</p>

<p>"So may God give me his glory!"</p>

<p>"And if you ever forget it, I am
to sing you this romance, to put
you in mind of what you say now."</p>

<p>"That is so; you must learn it."
And the boy set himself to teach his
sister the romance.</p>

<h2>THE GOOD GERARD OF COLOGNE.</h2>

<p class="center">BY RUDOLF OF EMS, VASSAL AT MONTFORT (THIRTEENTH CENTURY).</p>

<p class="center"><small>COMPILED AFTER THE GERMAN OF CARL SIMROCK.</small></p>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In the new cathedral at Magdeburg
the bells were ringing for the
first time. A large crowd gathered
to witness the consecration of the
church, founded and richly endowed
by the Emperor Otto the Great. He
went up the aisle before all the people,
not, as was then the custom,
to lay down gifts at the new
altar of God, but, with erect brow,
he stood, and thus he spoke: "There
is no gift in my hand for thee, O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_798" id="Page_798">[798]</a></span>
Lord; but when I lift up my eyes,
whatever I behold around me is my
gift to thee! This church I built for
the glory of thy name, and I endowed
it and made it so great that the
sons of kings think it an honor to
bow to its prince-bishop, and serve
him. The heathen that troubled thy
people, see I conquered them with
my strong arm&mdash;the Wends, the Sarbs,
and the Hungarians, they bowed
their heads to my sword, and their
knees to thy glory; and I made thy
name great in all the pagan lands,
and erected churches and bishoprics
to thy honor. And now show me
to-day, O my Lord, that thou hast
seen my foot going in thy path, thou,
who wilt give glory from heaven to
him who spreads thy glory on earth."
Thus the emperor spoke before all
the people. And lo! a voice sounded
from heaven as the voice of an
angel in anger, and it spoke with a
voice like thunder rolling in the
mountains: "Otto, king on earth,
see, the King in heaven had put a
chair by his side for thee to sit upon
it, and thou hast despised it in thy
vanity; he had prepared for thee a
crown of glory, and thou hast taken
the crown of pride that made angels
fall. He has heard with little pleasure
the thoughts of thy heart, that
asks for the highest place. Know,
that place is for him who most serves
God in humility and purity of heart;
that is, for the good Gerard, the merchant
in Cologne, whose name is
written in the book of life. And now
go and learn from him what is agreeable
to God, and then confess that
thy glory is vain and thy doing but
little. But know, that not readily
will he speak to thee; well would he
lay down his life rather than let the
fame of his righteousness sound up
to God by words from his own
mouth." When Otto had heard this,
he bowed his head in shame and was
humbled. He mounted his good
horse, and with three of his knights
rode over to Cologne. Among the
citizens who came to greet their emperor
in the vast hall, Otto saw one,
a tall man with a long white beard
and the step of a youth; and when
he asked the bishop who sat by his
side who that man was, he received
in answer: "That is the good Gerard,
the richest merchant in Cologne."
Then the emperor spoke to all the
assembled people: "I came here to
ask your advice, as I am in great
need of it. But I was counselled,
and even commanded, not to speak
but to one of you, and for that one
I choose thee, O Gerard! Thou seemest
to me rich in wisdom and experience."
And Gerard answered, bowing
before the emperor: "Shall I go
alone to give my advice, while there
are so many worthier ones here?"
But all the people said: "O king!
thy choice is good; there is no one
in this hall his equal in wisdom."
So the emperor took Gerard by the
hand, and led him to a chamber near
by, and locked the door after him,
and they sat down on one couch,
Gerard by Otto's side. Then Otto
said: "Gerard, it was to see thee
that I came here; pray tell me, how
did it happen that the name 'Good'
was given to thee? I would fain
like to know." "O great king!" answered
Gerard, "I do not know myself
what that means; there are so
many Gerards here; people only gave
me that name to distinguish me from
them." "Gerard, thou art deceiving
me!" the emperor called out; but
Gerard answered: "Oh! no, great
king, I should deceive thee if I spoke
otherwise. Never did I merit that
name, and it was often a burden to
me; because, while the world called
me 'the Good,' it reminded me how
seldom I did what pleased God. Often
do I send the poor man away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">[799]</a></span>
with a mean gift, whilst God gives
me riches; I give him sour beer and
black bread, I give him an old gown,
whilst many a new one I had, and
would not have missed them. I always
have liked to go to church
where the service was shortest, and
when I had once prayed with my
whole soul, I thought that would do
for half a year. Therefore, O king!
do not ask me what I have done to
deserve that high name." The emperor
said: "Gerard, thou must give
me a better answer, for I have sure
knowledge that thou hast done a
great deed for God's sake, and I
came to hear the account of it from
thy own mouth; therefore speak!"
"Oh! spare me," called out the good
man, "spare me, most gracious king!"
But Otto replied: "No, no! thou
only awakenest my impatience, and
I tell thee thou must yield to me
at the end, if even much against thy
will!" Then prayed the good man
in his heart: "O God! look at thy
servant! My king is angry with me,
and I cannot resist him any longer.
So if I reckon with thee, O Lord!
and praise myself for the little good
I ever did, do not thou turn away
thy grace from me, for what I say, I
do it much against my will." And
presently he threw himself at the emperor's
feet, saying: "Ten thousand
pounds of silver I have in my cellar,
take it and spare me the answer!"
"Gerard," said the rich emperor, "I
thought thou wert wiser. Such a
speech only excites my curiosity. And
I will tell thee, thou canst reveal me
everything, and it will be no sin to
thee&mdash;so I swear before God." Then
the good Gerard said, arising from
his knees, and sitting down: "God
knows my heart; he knows that, when
I do now as my king commands me
to do, my heart is full of grief, and
vanity is far from it."</p>


<h3>II.<br />

THE GOOD GERARD'S STORY.</h3>

<p>"When my father died, he left no
small fortune to me, his only heir.
But as I was a merchant, I thought
to double and double again my possessions,
and cause my son to be
called 'the rich Gerard,' as his fathers
had been called before him. So
I left him such fortune as would be
full enough for him, and took all the
rest, fifty thousand pounds of silver,
and carried it to my ship, together
with food for three years' voyage.
Experienced sailors were in my pay,
and my clerk was with me, to write
my accounts and read my prayers.
So I went to Russia, where I found
sables in profusion, and to Prussia's
rich amber strand, and from there,
by the Sea of the Middle, to the
East, and there I took in exchange
silk and woven goods from Damax
and Ninive; and well I thought a
threefold gain should be mine. Then
my heart began to long for wife and
child, and with great joy I told the
mariners to turn the ship homeward.
But a storm arose, and water and
wind were fighting for twelve days
and twelve nights, and threw my
ship to an unknown land, where a
beach gave us shelter. When the
sun shone again, and the sky looked
clear, I saw villages and hamlets
and fertile fields as far as my eyes
could reach, and near the sea a large
city with pinnacles and high walls.
We went to the port, and I found it
full of merchandise, a rich and stately
place, not unlike the old Cologne.
I went on land, for I saw the governor
of the city coming to view the
goods in the port, and many a knight
and vassal rode by his side; and I
thought to go up to him and ask his
protection. But when I came near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_800" id="Page_800">[800]</a></span>
him, he approached me with a quick
step, and, greeting me with his hand,
he thus spake: 'Welcome the first
one who comes to my market! Thou
art my guest, stranger! I see thou
comest from far off, perhaps from the
land of the Christians, who seldom
come here, in false fear that I would
harm them. But be of good cheer!
I do not harm the merchant, nor
need I covet his goods, for my land
is rich, and all the gold and precious
stones that it has in its mountains
are mine, and the pearls in the sea,
and many a rich vessel that the storm
throws on our coast.' Well was I
astonished at such a greeting; but I
accepted gladly; and the governor,
Stranamur by name, gave me the
best house, and took care of me that
nothing might harm me. Again and
again did he show me his love, and
soon friendship and confidence reigned
between us. Presently, he wanted
me to show him the treasures of
my ship, and I let it be done readily.
I saw him wonder at their splendor,
and with good cheer he said: 'Gerard,
I tell thee, thou hast brought
riches to this land so great that nobody
can buy them. But I will show
thee my treasure now, and then, if
it so please thee, we will exchange;
for in this land my treasure is of no
value, while in the land of the Christians
it might bring thee at least a
twentyfold gain.' And I answered:
'To seek gain is the merchant's duty.
I did show thee my treasure; now
let me see thine.' Then my host
led me by the hand to a hall, and as
I entered with a cheerful mind, hoping
to behold the riches of India,
gold and spices, I found the place
all empty of joy and filled with but
misery. Twelve young knights were
lying here in chains so heavy that
their weight pulled them down to
the low couches, and, though grief
and want had disfigured their beauty,
I saw they were of noble blood
and sons of high lords, born to govern
the world. Then my host beckoned
me to the next hall, where I
found again twelve knights in chains,
but old and pale, with venerable figure,
and hair and beard silver-white.
Then my host led me away by the
hand to the third hall, and said:
'Behold my most precious goods!'
Well, I found there goods great in
riches and beauty, for fifteen lovely
maidens were what he called the precious
merchandise. And my heart
pained me as I beheld them, for their
loveliness and gentle mind shone
amid the prison walls like stars in
the night; and I saw one like their
queen, a moon among the stars.
But Stranamur led me away and
said: 'Thou didst behold my goods;
shall we exchange? Thou mayest
easily get a rich ransom for each of
them, more than one hundred thousand
pounds of silver. In England
they were born; William, their king,
sent them over to Norway to bring
him home his bride, King Reinemund's
daughter, Irene, whom thou
hast seen. Coming home, a storm
threw them on my coast, and so
they were mine by right, for after
the custom of this land the strand is
mine. And I offer these knights to
thee, together with the fifteen maidens,
that thou mayest give me the
treasures I saw on thy ship.' I had
good reason to be astonished at such
an offer, for I saw clearly it would
be giving my goods for mere blanks,
and so I asked the governor to let
me please consider till the next
morning. And when I came to my
house I sat down thinking, and though
my heart told me to help the prisoners
in their misery, there was a voice
in my mind saying: 'Do not give
away the earnings of thy life for a
mere idea'; and well would I have
passed that night without coming to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801">[801]</a></span>
an end, if God in his goodness and
grace had not given his advice in
my heart. For I fell asleep, and
in my sleep I heard a voice of God's
angel, who spoke to me these words:
'Awake, Gerard, God's anger is calling
thee! Did he not say in his
mercy, "What thou givest to the
poorest of my brethren, thou givest
unto me"? What thou givest to the
needy ones, thou lendest to the
Lord; and doubt in him is great sin
to thee!' Then I awoke and fell
on my knees, and thanked God that
he had given me shame and repentance
in my heart, and humbled me
so as to save me from sin. The
next morning my host met me at the
gate, and with anxiety he asked what
it was my wish to do. And I answered:
'I am willing to make exchange
with thee, O Stranamur! if
thou allowest me one thing: give
back to the prisoners their ship and
all they brought on it, and give them
food and mariners, and whatever
they need to go home.' And the
governor answered: 'Dost thou think
me a thief, O Gerard? I thought,
friend, thou knewest me better. Not
one penny's worth will I keep from
the prisoners, and theirs shall be
whatever is needed for a safe and
speedy voyage.' After that he gave
me his hand, and we changed thus
mine and thine. Then the prisoners
were told of what had happened,
and they were clothed as became
them, and refreshed, and when they
beheld me, their thanks and tears
were such that my eyes overflowed,
even against my will. And I saw
the women's great beauty, and Irene
their queen, and though the earthly
crown was taken from her, there was
the crown of beauty and loveliness
on her brow. Then my clerk read
prayers, and we went to sea; the
right wind blew in our sails, and
bore us quickly outward. When we
came near the coast of England, I
spoke to the knights: 'Tell me, who
of you were born in England, that
they may go on their way home now.'
And they answered: 'From Norway
only came Queen Irene with two
of her maidens; all the rest of us
were born in England.' I said to
the knights: 'Go home, then, with my
blessings, noble lords! and if I did
what pleased you, think of me
with a friendly heart. Let King
William know, and also Reinemund
of Norway, that Queen Irene is in
my house and under my protection,
and that I am ready and willing to
give her up whenever they claim her.
When I send my messengers to you,
pay them back, O knights! what I
left for your sake in the strange land
of the heathen, if it so is convenient
to you. Then they thanked me so
that I had to hide from their embraces;
and we parted with many tears;
and they went their way, I mine.</p>

<p>"Soon I was home again. My wife
and son welcomed me gladly and
with thanksgivings, and after I had
told them all, they led Irene to my
house. And Queen Irene lived in
my house like one of us for many a
month, and my wife loved her, and
all the women of my household and
friendship, and she taught them many
a fine art, such as to embroider with
gold and thread of silver and pearl.
And God gave his blessing to my
trade, and I prospered. But every
day, Irene's loveliness grew more
lovely, and when I saw her so gentle
and smiling, I forgot my losses, and
my joy was greater than seventy-fold
gain would have made it. So
passed a year, and no message came
from Reinemund, nor from William,
the King of England, and I beheld
with sorrow that my queen's mind
was grieved, though she hid her
tears from our eyes. That I took
to my heart, and said to myself,
'I bought our sweet queen free from
great pain, and now I must see her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802">[802]</a></span>
in greater grief. There is no one here
kindred to her, and, when I am gone,
who is there to be her friend and protector?
King William is dead, and
so is Reinemund, the King of Norway,
and Irene, their queen, will die of
grief for them! Therefore I spoke
to her one day, and I asked her to
listen graciously, and then I said
thus: 'Thou must know, O queen!
that there is nothing that gives me so
much trouble than the thought what
one day shall become of thee when
I am no more. It is clear now, sorry
as I am for it, that thy friends are
dead, therefore, I think it our duty
to counsel wisely what is best for thy
future, O queen! As he is considered
a wise man who tries to forget
what fortune took from him, so I advise
thee, O my daughter! to choose
for a husband one from among my
family, that is, my son, as whose wife
honor and ample fortune will not be
wanting to thee.' At that, Irene
answered and spoke to me: 'O
dear father! I know me no better adviser
than thee in this world; so I
will do whatever pleases thee. Only
let me wait one year longer; if till
then no tidings have come from any
friends and kindred, thy wish shall
be mine!' But the year was soon
past, and no tidings had reached
us, neither from England nor from
Norway; and so Irene the queen
was to be the merchant's wife. I ordered
the wedding to be prepared
with the greatest splendor, and my
mind's only thought was to boast
with my riches; and I asked to the
feast many a rich merchant, and nobles
and dukes, and our prince the
bishop. So when Pentecost came,
that was to be the day of the wedding,
the bishop stood up before the
altar, and eleven noble squires knelt
down before him, and the twelfth
one, who was Gerard my son, and
the bishop blessed their swords, and
they arose as noble lords and knights.
My eye rested on him, and I saw he
was happy; he broke his lance in
honor of his bride; he watched for
the bell that should call him again
to the altar of God, there to receive
Irene as his wife: what could there
be to make his happiness greater and
to hinder him from drinking the cup
of bliss? But lo, I beheld one standing
far aside, a stranger with a pale
face and his eyes full of tears; he
gazed at Irene, my daughter, and he
shuddered, and his arm was around
a column that he might not fall.
He was a young man of great beauty,
and his skin was fine and white,
but his beard gray, and his dress that
of a beggar. As I saw him so full of
woe and tears, I went up to him, and
I asked him the cause of his grief,
that perhaps I might give help and
make joy and happiness come back
to his mind. But he would not
speak. At last, as I pressed him
very much, he said to me these
words: 'Such as thou doest see me
here with my hair gray before the
time, I am William, King of England.
I went to sea to meet my bride
coming from Norway, where I had
sent twelve maidens and twenty-four
knights to escort her over to
me. But a storm arose and threw
my ship against the rocks while I
was already in sight of them, the
tempest carried me to the shore and
I was thus saved, but not a word I
ever heard of the knights, or the maidens,
or of Irene my bride, the King
of Norway's daughter. For years
and years I have wandered about in
search of her, with my heart full of
despair and my hair and beard gray,
till at last I found her to-day, the
bride of another man. What shall
I tell thee more? My soul and body
are hers whom I love, and for her
sake I will now give them up into
death!' When I heard these words
from my guest, him who destroyed
all my joys, I said unto him: 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_803" id="Page_803">[803]</a></span>
Lord has done great things; honor
and fortune he might still give thee
back; wait here awhile, and be of
good cheer!' And I sent my valet
to him, to attend to all his needs
and wants, but I went to my prince
the bishop and told him the wonder
God had shown to us, and asked
him to help me with my son Gerard
and teach him a Christian's duty.
So I called my son away from the
side of his bride, and after he had
heard the tale, so full of marvel,
the bishop asked him: 'Wilt thou
then separate, Gerard, what before
God is united?' Then he answered
us, and he said: 'What do you think
of me? Shall I give up my love and
happiness and rest and peace?'
But the bishop spoke: 'Yes, my son,
thou shalt!' And my child began
to cry at these words, and I cried
with him, and he put his arms around
my neck and said, 'My father, then
let it be so!' and my heart felt joy at
these words. Shall I tell thee what
my heart felt when I saw King William
greet his bride? I am old as
thou art, O emperor! but I know
not without jealousy thou wouldst
have beheld it. And in my heart I
thanked the God of goodness who
had given so wise counsel in my mind
that my blessings now were greater
than what gold or silver could ever
have bought for me. After that I
filled my ship and took them over
to England, and great was the joy
of the four-and-twenty knights on beholding
their king and queen, and
of the whole people, and great were
their thanks to me, and only with
great pain could I hinder them from
bestowing all their riches on me, and
making me a prince and a great man
among them. But I will not repeat
to thee all they meant to do to me,
and the praises they gave me; for
God knows, in all my life I cannot
deserve them. And when I came
home, the people made much of me,
and called me 'the good'; though
thou knowest now, as well as I do,
that I am not good. It was only
by the angel's voice that my doubts
were taken, from me; I was full of
fear to lose my goods, and weak.
Besides, I am a sinner and am proud
and vain, so that I have been praising
myself before thee, O emperor!
while, couldst thou see my heart,
many a fault thou wouldst observe
within."</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Before Gerard had finished speaking,
the emperor's heart grew large
within him and made his eyes overflow;
for tears are a blessing which
God sends from heaven. He felt
shame and repentance, and these
two re-created his heart, and his mind
was healed from all false glory. And
he said: "Gerard, I tell thee, better a
good deal than silence is what thou
hast made known to me; for my
heart was sick with vainglory, and
pride overgrew the good deed. I
had built a great house to the Lord,
and the thought of that poisoned my
heart, so that it asked for reward.
But what I asked has turned against
me as a punishment, for no heart is
pure that seeks for glory only. When
I then praised myself at my good
deed, God sent me to thee to learn
true humility and charity. Truly
thou art good; for thy heart was not
moved by the praise of this world.
Thou hast given thy goods for
poor prisoners, thou hast taken the
wife from thy son, and refused the
riches of England in humility and
charity, only for the sake of the Lord
thy God. Well, my ride to thee
has brought me benefit. But thou,
O Gerard! pray the Lord to have
mercy upon him that prides in vainglory;
pray for thy emperor to our
God in heaven."</p>

<h2>EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION ACCORDING TO THE MOST
RECENT DISCOVERIES.</h2>

<p class="center"><small>FROM THE CORRESPONDANT.</small></p>


<blockquote>

<p class="hang">PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON THE
ANTIQUITY OF EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most striking fact respecting
the Egyptian monarchy is its antiquity.
"Forty centuries look down
upon you from these pyramids," were
the sublime words of Bonaparte; but
they do not express enough. The
progress of archæological science
shows that the reign of the Pharaohs
began more than three thousand
years before Christ. M. Bunsen
gives the date as 4245 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>, and
M. Mariette 5004, but with some
qualifications that should be mentioned.
"Egyptian chronology,"
says he, "presents difficulties which
no one, as yet, has surmounted....
To all dates before the
time of Psammetichus I. (665 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>),
it is impossible to give anything
but approximations, which become
more and more uncertain as we recede....
This uncertainty increases
in proportion as we go back
from the present age; so that, according
to the methods of computation,
there may be two thousand
years' difference in assigning the date
of the Egyptian monarchy."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>While fully admitting the reasonable
qualifications of the learned
director of the Egyptian antiquities,
it is no less certain, from the discoveries
already made, that the reign
of the Pharaohs extends back about
thirty centuries before the Christian
era.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of this ancient
nation, which is no less remarkable,
is that it manifests all the signs
of civilization from the beginning.
"It is a phenomenon worthy of the
most serious attention," says Champollion-Figeac,
"that Egypt possessed
in those remote ages all the civil,
religious, and military institutions indispensable
to the prosperity of a
great nation, and all the enjoyments
resulting from the perfection of the
arts, the advantages assured by the
authority of the civil and religious
laws, the culture of the sciences, and
a profound sentiment of the dignity
and destination of man."<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>"Egyptian civilization manifests
itself to us fully developed from
the earliest ages, and succeeding
ones, however numerous, taught it
little more,"<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> says M. Mariette.</p>

<p>"What is most extraordinary about
this mysterious civilization is that it
had no infancy.... Egypt, in
this respect as in so many others, is
an exception to the laws to which
the Indo-European and Semitic races
have accustomed us. It does not begin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_805" id="Page_805">[805]</a></span>with myths, heroic exploits, and
barbarism."<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The author we have
just quoted sought in vain, with all
his mind and learning, for the cause
of this strange phenomenon. "Egypt,"
says he, "is another China, mature
and almost decrepit from its birth,
and in its monuments and history
there is something at once childlike
and old."</p>

<p>This ingenious explanation excites
a smile, but not conviction. Rather
than admit revelation&mdash;that is to say,
the intervention of the divine agency
in the creation of man and the formation
of primitive nations&mdash;many learned
men of our day prefer to take refuge
in the most singular and inadmissible
theories. According to them, human
society must "commence with myths
and barbarism," and man himself with
the savage nature of the brutes. But
they are forced to acknowledge that
Egypt is a decided exception to this
theory.</p>

<p>"The gigantic labors of the Suez
Canal in removing the immense accumulations
of sand, so often amassed
as if to preserve the past history of
the world, have not revealed a single
vestige of uncivilized men who, before
the deluge, were scattered over
the rest of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>To resolve the problem of ancient
Egyptian civilization, we propose an
explanation more conformable to the
traditions and the dignity of the human
race. It is true, this explanation
is not new, for it was evident to the
sages of pagan times a long time before
it was fully unfolded by Christian
philosophers. Socrates taught that
"the ancients, better than we and
nearer the gods, had transmitted by
tradition the sublime knowledge they
had received from them." Plato
adds that "the earliest of mankind,
issuing from the hands of the gods,
must have known them as well as we
know our own fathers, and that it is
truly impossible not to believe the
testimony of the children of the
gods."</p>

<p>What the wise men of Greece perceived
through the thick veil of paganism,
we behold clearly by the
light of Christianity and the Holy
Scriptures. It seems to us a simple
thing to believe that the Egyptian
nation, the first founded, not many
centuries after the deluge, must have
been organized according to the principles
of the national law of which
the descendants of Noah had not yet
lost the tradition. "If we believe in
the truth of the Scriptural accounts,"
says an illustrious promoter of social
reforms in England,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> "we must also
believe that when the families descended
from Ham and Japheth began
their long migrations, they bore
with them the religious traditions
they possessed in common with the
children of Shem.</p>

<p>"As to those who will not accept
the testimony of the book which, to
give it the most unpretending of its
august titles, is the most ancient and
most venerable document of human
history, we could reply that the reasoning
still remains the same. The
progress of ethnological and philological
researches furnishes us with evident
proofs of a continued migration
of the Touranian and Aryan races
towards the north and west from
places necessarily undefined, but certainly
from the vicinity of the nomad
patriarchs. On the other hand, nothing
shows that their traditions have
a different source from that given in
the Book of Genesis&mdash;the three divisions
of Noah's family. If, then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_806" id="Page_806">[806]</a></span>everything seems to demonstrate the
intimate connection of these primitive
races with the Semitic tribes,
how could the descendants of Ham
and Japheth have left behind the irreligious
traditions when, for the first
time, they left their brethren?"</p>

<p>The descendants of Ham, ancestors
of the first Egyptians, doubtless
preserved, with their religious traditions,
the moral principles that guarantee
the existence and perpetuity
of domestic life, and the notions of
the arts indispensable to its comfort.
"With the human race," says Bossuet,
"Noah preserved the arts; not
only those necessary to life which man
knew from the beginning, but those
subsequently invented. The first arts
which man learned, apparently from
his Creator, were agriculture, the duties
of pastoral life, the fabrication of
clothing, and perhaps the construction
of habitations. Therefore we do
not see the rudiments of these arts in
the East, in those regions whence the
human race was dispersed. This is
why everything springs from those
lands, always inhabited, where the fundamental
arts remained. The knowledge
of God and memories of creation
are there preserved."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The ruins of the Tower of Babel
still show to what a degree of advancement
the art of building had arrived,
and the details given us in the
Bible about the construction of the
ark display an amount of nautical
knowledge which must have been
transmitted to the skilful boatmen of
the Nile and the bold navigators of
ancient Phœnicia.</p>

<p>We will not extend these preliminary
observations, which we think
throw sufficient light on the origin of
Egyptian civilization, the incontestable
antiquity of which is as enigmatical
as that of the Sphynx to the astonished
eyes of the modern Œdipus.
A truly learned man, who shows himself
by his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">conférences</i> in the Rue Bonaparte
thoroughly conversant with
the discoveries of contemporaneous
Egyptology, and who is not ashamed
to seek light from revelation as well
as from science, has resolved the problem
in the following terms: "There
is not, in the first ages of the Egyptian
monarchy, the least trace of the
rude beginnings of a nation in its infancy.
Indeed, we should not forget
that this country never passed through
the savage state, and that, if the
truths revealed to the patriarchs were
adulterated by the race of Ham, they
still retained sufficient light not to
remain satisfied with material enjoyments
alone."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>Let us now endeavor to penetrate,
by the light of these principles,
as far as we can into the labyrinth
of Egyptian antiquities.</p>


<h3>BOOK FIRST.<br />

THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION.</h3>

<h4>I.<br />

DOMESTIC REGULATIONS.</h4>

<p>The institutions which are the safeguards
of family life and of property
are essential to society and the perpetuity
of a nation, and these foundations
of the social life seem to have
been as firmly established among the
ancient Egyptians as their own pyramids.
The sacredness of the family
tie was the result of unity of marriage
and respect to parents, and its perpetuity
was assured by the rights of primogeniture,
which were universally
admitted from the royal family down
to that of the most humble laborer.
This was the fundamental principle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807">[807]</a></span>of family life and of society. Therefore
we see Pharaoh in the Holy
Scriptures resist all the plagues God
sent upon Egypt for the deliverance
of the Israelites; but when the first-born
of the Egyptians were smitten
in one night, the king yielded at once,
for the whole nation felt that a blow
had been given to the very source of
its existence.</p>

<p>The Egyptian monuments of every
age prove that the paternal authority
was universally regarded with great
respect. On a great number of stelæ
collected by M. Mariette in the museum
of Boulak are these words:</p>

<p>"Oblation in honor of the head of
the house." (Here follows the name.)</p>

<p>"The religious laws of Egypt obliged
families on certain days in the
year to present offerings to deceased
parents. One stela, consecrated to
the memory of Entef, who lived at
the beginning of the twelfth dynasty,
is only a representation of one of
these festivals. Entef is seated beside
his wife. His sons and daughters
present themselves before him.
Some are saying the prescribed prayers;
others bringing food and perfumes.
The last scene depicted is
interesting from the variety of representations.
Besides parts of animals
already sacrificed, the servants are
bringing live animals."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p>We may judge of the sentiments
of the ancient Egyptians with regard
to paternal authority by the
following passages from an ancient
document, the authenticity of which
has never been contested:</p>

<p>"The son who receives his father's
advice will live to be old. Beloved
by God is obedience. Disobedience
is hated by God. The obedience of
a son to his father is a joy,...
he is beloved by his father, and his
renown is on the lips of the living
who walk the earth. The rebellious
son sees knowledge in ignorance, and
virtue in vice; he daily commits all
kinds of frauds with impunity, and
lives thereby as if he were dead.
What wise men consider death is
his daily life. He keeps on his way
laden with maledictions. A son
docile in the service of God will be
happy in consequence of his obedience...."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>We cannot help recognizing in
this precious document the moral
ideas of primitive times, the tradition
of which is so faithfully preserved in
the Bible. The fourth precept of
the Decalogue is found here almost
literally: "Honor thy father and
thy mother, that thou mayest be
long-lived upon the land."</p>

<p>Upon a mortuary stela described
by M. Mariette in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Notice du
Musée de Boulaq</i> (No. 44, p. 72),
Maï, the defunct, is seen receiving the
homage of the members of his family.
"One of the sons of Maï is called
Men-Nefer. For some unknown reason,
his name is erased from the list
of the family, and, in fact, his whole
image is hammered down. Another
son likewise incurred this mark of
infamy, which is only given to the
proper name of the personage."</p>

<p>Respect to parents naturally leads
to that for the aged. "The Egyptians
have this custom in common
with the Lacedæmonians," says Herodotus;
"young men, when they
meet their elders, turn aside for them
to pass; at their approach they rise
from their seats."</p>

<p>The obligations of parents towards
their children were strictly enjoined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808">[808]</a></span>in ancient Egypt, as is evident from
a curious passage from Diodorus,
which, at the same time, shows how
the manners and laws favored the
fecundity of marriage, the only
source of a robust and numerous
population:</p>

<p>"Parents are obliged to rear all
their offspring in order to increase
the population, which is regarded as
the chief source of the prosperity of
a kingdom.... They provide
for the support of their children at
little expense, and with incredible
frugality. They give them very simple
food: the stems of the papyrus
which can be roasted, roots and
stems of palustrine plants, sometimes
raw, sometimes boiled and roasted,
and as all children go unshod in
that temperate climate, the parents
do not estimate the expense of a
child before the age of puberty to
be more than twenty drachmæ (a
little less than twenty francs).</p>

<p>"The children of the common people
are taught the trade of their parents,
which they are to practise for
life, as we have remarked. Those who
are initiated into the arts are alone
charged with teaching others to
read."</p>

<p>So simple and natural a system of
education must have singularly favored
the fruitfulness of marriage
among the masses, and the number
of children was not less among the
aristocracy. We see from the simplest
monuments, where the funeral
honors rendered to the head of a
family by all his children are painted
on a wood panel, or sculptured on a
slab of calcareous stone, that their
number, including both sexes, amounted
to eight or a dozen, or even more,
and the more elaborate monuments,
indicating distinguished families and
the upper classes, render the same
testimony as to the large number of
children in each family&mdash;as in the
sculpture at Thebes, which gives a
list of nine male children of Rameses
Meiamoun, and a greater number of
daughters. In this respect the ancient
Egyptian nation differed from
people of modern times.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The inequality that weighed so
heavily upon woman among ancient
nations is not found in Egypt. "Women,
on the contrary," says M. Mariette,
"held a prominent position in
a family. The rights they inherited
were not absorbed in those of their
husbands, and they were transmitted
intact to their children. At certain
epochs, the family monuments often
named the mother to the exclusion
of the father. In the inscriptions of
the ancient empire, conjugal affection
is frequently expressed in a delicate
and touching manner." And
it has been remarked, and with reason,
that the women who played a
great <i>rôle</i> in the history of the ancient
dynasties enjoyed in private life a
liberty of action quite foreign to the
manners of most Oriental nations.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>"It is by the social position of woman,"
says M. de Bonald, "that we
can always determine the nature of the
political institutions of a people. In
Egypt, where we find the type of the
social organization, the law submitted
the husband to his wife in honor
of Isis, which means that this dependence
was inspired by religion and
morals, rather than commanded by
law. Neither divorce nor polygamy
was known there."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>The elevated condition of woman
in Egypt is attested by the monuments,
which show her sharing with
her husband in the direction of the
family.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>Champollion-Figeac has given us
curious details respecting the private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809">[809]</a></span>customs of wealthy families, the garb
and toilet of the women and children,
and the peculiar characteristics
of the Egyptian race:</p>

<p>"The head was habitually uncovered;
the hair curled or plaited; a
woollen mantle was sometimes worn
over the tunic, and laid aside when
they entered the temples. The women,
besides the tunic, wore ample
vestments of linen or cotton, with
large sleeves, plain or striped, white,
or of some uniform color. Their
hair was artistically arranged. Their
heads were ornamented with bandeaux,
and their ears and hands with
rings. A light slipper was worn on
the feet. They went out with uncovered
faces, accompanied by some
of the numerous female servants of
the house. Dressed also in ample
robes of striped cloth, these servants
had their hair braided and hanging
down over the shoulders. They
also wore a large apron, like their
dress, with no jewels or other ornaments,
and held themselves in a respectful
posture in the presence of
the lady of the house. Girls issuing
from childhood were dressed like
their mothers, with the exception of
the ornaments of the head, and children
of both sexes wore ear-rings as
their only ornament (or dress) for
the first five or six years.</p>

<p>"They were a fine race, tall in
stature, generally somewhat slender,
and long-lived, as is proved by the
sepulchral inscriptions of those over
eighty years of age. But exceptions
to these general statements are found
among the Egyptians as among
other nations. We only make a
general statement of the principal
features of their physical nature, according
to the monuments, in accord
with historical accounts. Herodotus,
who saw Egypt before its complete
decadence, declares that, next to the
Lybians, the Egyptians were the
healthiest of people. The great
number of mummies of men and
women which have been opened corroborate
this testimony."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>Bossuet, in his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Discours sur l'Histoire
universelle</i>, gives a bold sketch
of the physiognomy of the Egyptians,
and shows the result of their
manly training: "These wise Egyptians,"
says he, "studied the regimen
that produces solid minds, robust
bodies, fruitful women, and vigorous
children. Consequently, the people
increased in number and strength.
The country was naturally healthy,
but philosophy taught them that nature
wishes to be aided. There is an
art of forming the body as well as
the mind.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> This art, which we have
lost through our indifference, was
well known to the ancients, and
Egypt acquired it. For this laudable
end, the inhabitants had recourse
to exercise and frugality.... Races
on foot, horseback, and in chariots
were practised with admirable skill
in Egypt. There were not finer
horsemen in the world than the
Egyptians.</p>

<p>"When Diodorus tells us they rejected
wrestling as giving a dangerous
and factitious strength, he had
reference to the excessive feats of the
athletes, which Greece herself, though
she crowned the victorious wrestler
in her games, disapproved of as unsuitable
for free persons; and Diodorus
himself informs us that the Mercury
of the Egyptians invented the
rules as well as the art of forming the
body.</p>

<p>"We must similarly modify the
statement of the same author respecting
music. That which the
Egyptians despised, according to
him, as tending to lessen courage,
was doubtless soft, effeminate music,
which only excites to pleasure and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810">[810]</a></span>false tenderness. For the Egyptians,
so far from despising music of an
elevated character, whose noble accords
exalt the mind and heart,
ascribed its invention, according to
Diodorus himself, to their Mercury,
as well as the gravest of musical instruments.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>"Among the varied exercises
which formed a part of the military
education, and are sculptured on the
numerous monuments, are found
complete gymnastic rules. Nothing
could be more varied than the attitudes
and positions of the wrestlers,
attacking, defending themselves, receding
and advancing by turns,
bending down or turning over, rising
up again, and triumphing over the
opponents by dint of strength, art,
and skill. In these exercises the
wrestlers only wore a large girdle,
that supported and favored their
efforts."</p>

<p>A fortunate discovery by M. Mariette
enables us to complete the portrait
of the Egyptian race. A statue
found in the Necropolis of Sakkarah,
near Memphis, represents a person
standing wearing a plain wig,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> the
arms close to the body. He is walking,
with the left leg advanced.
"This fine monument," says M. Mariette,
"is at once a perfect model of
the Fellah of the middle provinces
of Egypt and a specimen of the
works of art in the ancient kingdom.
The person represented is tall and
slender, with a small hand, the eyes
wide open, the nose short and full,
the lips somewhat thick, but pleasant
in expression, and the cheeks plump.
The breadth of the shoulders is remarkable.
The breast is full, but,
like the race itself, the hips are small,
and the lean and muscular limbs
seem formed for racing."</p>

<h4>II.<br />

THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE PEOPLE.</h4>

<p>The Egyptians, the first to organize
a truly civilized society, were
divided into distinct classes, in which
the occupations of the different families
were hereditary. The two dominant
classes were the sacerdotal and
military. Inferior to them were the
agriculturists, shepherds, merchants,
artisans, and boatmen, on whom devolved
the cultivation of the land,
the care of the flocks, commerce, the
trades, the means of communication
and transportation on the Nile, and
the canals that covered the land.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p>To understand the strength and
permanence of this organization, we
must revert to its origin. The social
institutions of ancient nations in the
beginning depended essentially on
the family&mdash;the foundation of all
society. The children were naturally
inclined to follow the occupations of
their parents. The necessity of providing
for their own livelihood as
soon as they were able, and the
facility of working under the direction
of their fathers, induced them to
embrace the occupation to which
they had been accustomed from infancy.
It was thus that not only
agriculture, but all the arts, trades,
and sciences, became hereditary in
the family. Once having a means
of subsistence, it was natural to endeavor
to preserve it. Identity of
interests drew together those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811">[811]</a></span>followed the same trades, which led
to the formation of corporations
united by ties of blood and similarity
of pursuits.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were probably the
first nation to systematically apply
these principles. "They were not allowed,"
says Bossuet, "to be useless
to the country. The law assigned
every one his employment, which was
transmitted from father to son. They
could not have two professions, or
change the one they had; but then
every employment was honored.
There must be some pursuits and
some people of a more elevated condition,
as eyes are needed in the
body, but their brilliancy does not
make them despise the feet or the
baser parts. Thus, among the Egyptians,
the priests and warriors
were particularly honored; but all
trades, even the lowest, were esteemed.
It was considered culpable to
despise citizens whose labors, whatever
they might be, contributed to
the public welfare. By this means
all the arts were brought to perfection.
The honor which tended to develop
them was everywhere manifested,
and that was done better to which
they had been accustomed and in
which they had been experienced
from childhood.</p>

<p>"But there was one pursuit common
to all&mdash;the study of the civil
laws and the requirements of religion.
Ignorance of religion and of the regulations
of the land was inexcusable
in any rank. Each profession had
its own district. No inconvenience
resulted from this, as the country
was not extensive, and with so much
system the indolent had nowhere to
hide themselves."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>We recognize the genius of Bossuet
in the clear outlines he has drawn
of the plan of organized labor, suited
to the state of things, as well as the
fundamental principles of all society.
The respect for family life and tradition,
the maintenance of social harmony
and the grades of society, the
protection of honored labor, are all
remembered in this admirable sketch
of the political economy of the ancient
Egyptians.</p>

<p>But we must not, nevertheless, conclude
that professions were rigorously
hereditary and the castes unchangeable.
Ampère proves the contrary
by means of the sepulchral inscriptions
discovered in the tombs contemporary
with the ancient dynasties.
They show, in fact, that a great
number of marriages were contracted
between persons of different classes.
"What destroys the hypotheses of
exclusive professions," says that
learned academician, "to which each
family, and consequently each caste,
was supposed to be devoted, is, finding
one member of a family in the
sacerdotal state, another pursuing the
military life, and the remainder engaged
in some civil profession."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p>It is true the monuments, a funereal
distinction of the upper classes,
never mention the laborer or the
artisan; but it is reasonable to believe
that, among a people so regularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_812" id="Page_812">[812]</a></span>organized, the different classes
were governed by the same laws and
customs. In large families, like those
of primitive times generally, liberty
of vocation easily harmonized with
hereditary professions. One alone&mdash;that
of the swineherd&mdash;was rigorously
hereditary. Those who pursued this
employment were obliged to marry
among themselves, on account of the
invincible repugnance felt for the unclean
animals they had charge of.
Herodotus says the Egyptian swineherd
alone, of all the nation, could
not enter into any temple in the
country. No one would marry their
daughters or give their children to
them in marriage. They could only
marry among themselves.</p>

<h4>III.<br />

DIVISION OF LANDED PROPERTY.</h4>

<p>The law concerning the landed
property contributed no less than the
hereditary professions to preserve a
distinction of classes and the social
gradations. "All the land," says
Diodorus, speaking of the institutions
of ancient Egypt, "is divided
into three parts. The first and
largest belongs to the priesthood,
who are greatly respected by the
native population on account of their
religious functions as well as for
their thorough education. Their
revenues are expended for the sacrifices,
the maintenance of their subordinates,
and their own wants. The
Egyptians think the religious ceremonies
should not be changed, that
they should always be performed by
the same functionaries, and that
these sovereign counsellors should
be above want. In fact, the priests
are the chief counsellors of the king,
whom they aid by their labors, their
advice, and their knowledge. By
means of astrology and the inspection
of the sacrificial victims, they
foretell the future, and they relate
useful examples of deeds taken from
the sacred books. It is not here as
in Greece, where a single man or
woman has charge of the sacerdotal
functions. In Egypt, those who are
occupied in the sacrifices and conduct
the worship of the gods are
numerous, and they transmit their
profession to their descendants.
They are exempted from taxes, and
they rank next to the king in position
and privileges.</p>

<p>"The second part of the land belongs
to the king, the revenues of
which are employed for the expenses
of war and the maintenance of the
court. The king rewards merit from
his own income, without having recourse
to the purse of any private
individual.</p>

<p>"The remaining portion of the
land belongs to the soldiers and all
those who are under command of
the military leaders. Strongly attached
to their country, on account
of the wealth they possess, they
brave all the dangers of war to defend
it. It is, in fact, absurd to
entrust the safety of a nation to
men who have no interest in the
common welfare. What is especially
remarkable, the soldiers, living thus
at their ease, increase the population
to such a degree that the government
is able to dispense with
foreign troops. And the children,
encouraged by the example of their
fathers, eagerly embrace the military
life, and are invincible by their
bravery and experience."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_813" id="Page_813">[813]</a></span></p>
<p>Diodorus, as is known, was a contemporary
of Julius Cæsar and Augustus.</p>

<p>In addition to what Diodorus says
of the military class, we will add the
following extracts from Herodotus:
"Twelve acres of excellent land were
given, under the first kings, to each
head of a family." (He is speaking
of the same class.) And a little
further on: "Each soldier possesses
twelve acres of land, exempt from
taxation."</p>

<p>This distribution of the landed
property is similar to that in France
in feudal times, and which still exists,
to a degree, in England, where the
clergy and aristocracy possess the
greater part of the land.</p>

<p>The two first classes were exempt
from taxation, but the priests were at
all the expense of public worship,
and, although the royal treasury provided
for the expenses of war, the
soldiers evidently had to provide, not
only their own supplies, and equipment,
but also for the expenses of
military organization; and, like our
ancient noblesse, they alone had the
glorious privilege of paying a tribute
of blood.</p>

<p>We have not a sufficiently clear
knowledge of Egyptian civilization
to state the law of succession with
certainty, or how the preservation of
the patrimony of each family was
preserved.</p>

<p>Modern publicists, confounding
stability with immovableness, have
thought the power of bequeathing
property did not exist under the ancient
laws of the East. This opinion
seems incompatible with the nature
of the paternal authority, which was
carried to a sovereign degree in the
families of primitive times. Does
not the Bible represent the patriarch
Jacob on his death-bed disinheriting
Reuben, the oldest of his twelve
sons, and giving his inheritance to
Judah? And this scene, so well related
in Holy Scripture, took place
in Egypt itself. It is true, the descendants
of Abraham had preserved
the traditions of the patriarchal life
more perfectly than the Egyptians,
but the latter, as we have seen, also
professed great respect for the paternal
authority, the rights of which
must have harmonized with the requirements
of the principle of hereditary
professions. A passage from
Diodorus seems to decide the question
in this sense: "The legislator
regarded property as belonging to
those who had acquired it by their
labor, by <i>transmission</i>, or by gift."
However this may be, it is certain
that all the land, according to Herodotus
and Diodorus, belonged originally
to the king, the priesthood, and
the military class. This division of
the landed property must have greatly
contributed to the stability which
is so distinctive a characteristic of
the Egyptian nation. The hereditary
transmission of the land in the sacerdotal
and military classes effectually
assured a solid basis for their preponderance,
and at the same time guaranteed
the independence and dignity
of the aristocratic classes. They
were thus fully enabled to second the
king in the government, administration,
and defence of the country.</p>

<h4>IV.<br />

ORGANIZATION OF LABOR.</h4>

<p>Ancient Egypt, from an agricultural
point of view, is in some respects
worthy of attention. Certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_814" id="Page_814">[814]</a></span>
modern writers have supposed the
members of the military class cultivated
their own lands, as the legionaries
of ancient Rome, but this supposition
is irreconcilable with the testimony
of the ancient historians who
visited Egypt. Herodotus says they
were "not allowed to practise any
mechanical art, but were skilled in
the art of war, which they transmit
from father to son." This point is
settled by the following passage from
Diodorus: "The agriculturists pass
their lives in cultivating the lands,
which are leased them at a moderate
price by the king, priests, and
warriors."</p>

<p>As to the sacerdotal class, absorbed
in the religious observances, the administration,
the study of the laws and the
sciences, it was impossible for its members
to engage in the cultivation of the
land, which, as we have seen, they leased.
Notwithstanding great research, no
information has been obtained about
the economic condition of the agricultural
class. We only know, from
the extract quoted from Diodorus,
that the land was leased at a moderate
price. The stability which prevailed
in Egypt, and the principle
of hereditary professions, induce us
to believe that private estates generally
had a kind of entail, so the same family
of husbandmen lived from generation
to generation on the same land.
This principle of stability was eminently
favorable to the moral and
material welfare of the family, as well
as to the progress of agriculture.
Reared from childhood amid rural
occupations, they acquired more
experience in them than any other
nation. They perfectly understood
the nature of the soil, the art of irrigation,
and the time for sowing and
harvesting, a knowledge they acquired
partly from their ancestors and partly
by their own experience. The same
observation may be applied to the
shepherds, who inherited the care of
their flocks, and passed their whole
lives in rearing them; thus perfecting
the knowledge acquired from their
fathers.</p>

<p>The other industrial classes were
no less prosperous. They also inherited
their occupations. A celebrated
publicist states that "the
Egyptian artisans held no property."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p>To prove the truth of such an assertion,
it must be shown that they
were reduced to a state of slavery:
which is formally contradicted by
Diodorus, as we shall see presently,
and it is not confirmed by any of the
recently discovered monuments. It
may be safely affirmed that the artisans
of ancient Egypt, with the exception
of those attached to the temples
or public works, had a complete
right over their trades and the fruit
of their labors. The possession of
land was denied them, but there is
reason to believe they could own
their dwellings and the little gardens
that surrounded them.</p>

<p>Champollion-Figeac, who rivalled
his brother in the sciences and the
profound knowledge of the arts and
pursuits of ancient Egypt, represents
the people of that country with their
"plates of glazed earthenware, their
rush-baskets, and their shoes of papyrus."
"The lower classes," says he
in another place, "generally wore a
short linen tunic called a calasiris,
confined by a girdle around the hips,
and sometimes with short sleeves
trimmed with fringe at the end."</p>

<h4>V.<br />

SOCIAL CONDITION OF THE LABORING
CLASSES.</h4>

<p>Notwithstanding the light which
the wonderful discoveries of modern
science have thrown on the history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">[815]</a></span>of ancient Egypt, we still lack precise
information respecting the internal
organization of the corporations occupied
in manual labor. We only
know from Diodorus that they belonged
to the class of citizens&mdash;that
is, they were <em>free</em> men. "There are
in the kingdom," says he, after having
spoken of the two dominant
classes, "three classes of <i>citizens</i>:
shepherds, husbandmen, and artisans."</p>

<p>Labor among the ancients was
not always a mark of servitude.
In retracing the origin of the ancient
nations, as far as the light of history
diffuses its rays, we find agriculture
and the industrial pursuits carried
on everywhere by free labor.</p>

<p>The monarchical and aristocratical
government contributed not a little
to the maintenance of stability in the
artisan families, by preserving them
from the fruitless agitations into
which the working-classes are fatally
drawn under democratic governments.
Diodorus shows this admirably in
the following passage, to which we
invite the attention of the reader:</p>

<p>"It must be considered that the
arts have greatly developed among
the Egyptians, and arrived at a high
degree of perfection. It is the only
country in which a workman is not
permitted to fill any public office, or
employ himself in any other way
than that assigned him by law or by
inheritance. By this restriction, the
workman is not diverted from his occupations
either by the jealousy of
his masters<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> or by political affairs.
Among other nations, on the contrary,
the artisan is almost wholly
absorbed in the idea of making a
fortune, some by agriculture, others
through commerce, and some carry
on several trades at once. And in democratic
countries, most of them frequent
the popular assemblies and increase
disorder by selling their votes,
whereas an Egyptian artisan who
should take a part in public affairs,
or worked at several trades at once,
would incur a large fine. Such are
the social divisions and political
constitutions the ancient Egyptians
transmitted from father to son."</p>

<p>What a contrast between the artisan
of the old Greek republics, "frequenting
public assemblies and extending
disorder by selling their
votes," and the workman of the
Egyptian monarchy, peacefully pursuing
the occupation of his fathers,
happy and contented amid political
agitations which must have been very
rare under a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> in which traditional
customs were religiously observed!
Thus, with the exception of
enforced labor on the public works,
we are not unwilling to admit the
fidelity of the picture Champollion-Figeac
has drawn of the condition
of the laboring classes in ancient
Egypt: "The extraordinary fertility
of the soil, the beneficent climate,
the wise laws perfected by experience
and sanctioned by time, the active
and benevolent administration, constantly
occupied in promoting and
sustaining public order in the country
as well as the city, the inevitable
influence of religion upon a people
naturally religious and impressionable&mdash;the
most religious of men, according
to Herodotus&mdash;allow us to
believe that the masses in ancient
Egypt were happy, and that, occupied
and laborious, modest in their
manners and wishes, they found in
labor a source of durable pleasure."</p>

<p>By this wise social organization,
which kept each one in his place,
the artisan remained faithfully devoted
to his pursuits, as the husbandman
to his labor. They both
fully enjoyed the stability so necessary
to success. But, as we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">[816]</a></span>
see, the liberty and well-being of the
workmen of all classes were affected
by the frightful labors imposed on
them in the public works.</p>


<h3>BOOK SECOND.<br />

THE POLITICAL, LEGAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE
INSTITUTIONS.</h3>

<h4>I.<br />

ROYALTY.</h4>

<p>The keystone of the social edifice
in the ancient kingdom of Egypt
may be regarded as royalty. The
crown was hereditary in the male
line in the order of primogeniture&mdash;brother
succeeding to brother without
surviving children. In case of
no son, the daughter succeeded her
father, and he whom she espoused
was the queen's husband, but not the
king.</p>

<p>The king, through the different
members of his family, presided in
all the branches of the government
and public administration, thus giving
perfect unity and complete monarchical
power. "In fact," says
Champollion, "the dignities of the
different orders were reserved for the
king's sons by the laws of the country.
The oldest son of Sesostris
bore the titles of Fan-bearer of the
king's left hand, Royal Secretary,
Basilico-grammatist, and Commander-in-chief
of the Army. The second
son was also Fan-bearer of the king's
left hand, Royal Secretary, and Commander-in-chief
of the Royal Guard.
The third son added to the two first titles
that of Commander-in-chief of the
Cavalry. The same qualifications
were also given to other princes, and
seem to have belonged to all the
royal generations, as well as several
sacerdotal and civil titles, such as
prophets (a class of priests) of different
gods, high-priest of Ammon,
and supreme head of different civil
functions." Thus the king concentrated
in his family the most important
offices in the army, the civil administration,
and the priesthood.</p>

<p>Finally, the better to consecrate
the principle that all power and dignity
had their source in the throne,
the principal leaders in the army and
administration received the title of
the king's cousin, relative, or friend.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Such was the real nature of the
royal power in the eyes of ancient
Egypt.</p>

<p>"The Egyptians were generally
considered the most grateful of men
toward their benefactors. They considered
the best guarantee of society
to be a reciprocal interchange of services
and gratitude. It is true, men
are more inclined to be useful to
others when a real benefit is to be
derived from the gratitude of the
obliged. It was from these motives
the Egyptians respected and adored
their kings as if they were gods. The
sovereign authority, divinely conferred,
according to their belief, with
will and power to diffuse benefits,
was to them a godlike attribute."<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>While giving the consecration of a
divine character to the royal authority,
the wise legislators of old Egypt
did not the less take the precautions,
suggested by a profound knowledge
of human nature, of restricting the
monarchical power within just limits,
of inspiring the king with virtuous
inclinations, and of preventing him
from evil-doing. "In the first place,
the kings of Egypt did not lead as
free and independent a life as the
kings of other nations. They could
not act according to their own will.
Everything was regulated by law,
not only their public, but their daily
private life. They were served, not by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817">[817]</a></span>bondsmen or slaves, but by the sons
of the chief priests, reared with the
greatest care, and more than twenty
years of age. The king, thus served
day and night by real models of virtue,
would never be countenanced in
any blamable action. For a sovereign
would not be worse than any
other man if he had not around him
those who flattered his desires. The
precise duties of the king for every
hour of the day and night were fixed
by law, and not left to his own inclinations.
His first act in the morning
was to read the letters sent from
every direction, that he might be
thoroughly informed of all that had
occurred in the kingdom, and act in
consequence. Then, after bathing,
putting on magnificent garments, and
assuming the insignia of royalty, he
offered a sacrifice to the gods. The
victims were led to the altar; the
high-priest, according to custom,
stood near the king, and, in presence
of the people, prayed the gods aloud
to preserve the king in health and all
other blessings as long as he fulfilled
the laws. At the same time, the high-priest
was obliged to enumerate the
virtues of the king, and dwell on his
piety towards the gods and his meekness
towards man, representing him
as temperate, just, magnanimous, opposed
to lying, loving to do good,
the complete master of his passions,
inflicting on the guilty the least punishment
merited, and recompensing
good actions beyond their value.
After the addition of similar praises,
the priest ended by an imprecation
against all faults committed through
ignorance; for the king, being irresponsible,
imputed all his faults to his
ministers and counsellors, on whom
was invoked the merited chastisement.
The high-priest acted thus in
order to inspire the king with a fear
of the gods, and habituate him to a
pious and exemplary life, not by a
bitter exhortation, but by attractive
praises of the practice of virtue.
Finally, the king inspected the entrails
of the victim, and declared the
favorable auspices. The hierogrammatist
read some sentences and useful
accounts of celebrated men from
the sacred books, that the sovereign
might select an example by which to
regulate his actions. There was a
fixed time not only for audiences,
but for exercise, the bath, and, in
short, for every act of life. The king
was accustomed to live on simple
food. He was allowed veal and
goose for meat. He could only
drink a certain quantity of wine that
would neither produce repletion nor
intoxication. In a word, the prescribed
regimen was so regular that
it might be supposed ordained not
by legislators, but by the best physicians,
aiming only at the preservation
of health.</p>

<p>"It seems strange for a king not
to be at liberty to choose his daily
food, and still more so that he could
not pronounce a judgment or take
a decision, or punish any one through
passion or caprice, or any other unjust
reason, but be forced to act
according to the laws fixed for each
particular case. As it was an established
custom, the king could not
take offence, and he was not discontented
with his lot. On the contrary,
he considered his a very happy life,
while other men, abandoned without
restraint to their natural passions,
were exposed to many inconveniences
and dangers. He thought
himself fortunate in often seeing
other men violate their consciences
by persisting in bad designs, influenced
by love, hatred, or some other
passion, while he himself, emulous of
living after the example of the wisest
of men, could only fall into venial
errors. Animated with such just sentiments,
the king conciliated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_818" id="Page_818">[818]</a></span>
affection of his people as that of his
family. Not only the priesthood,
but all the Egyptian nation were
less solicitous about their own families
and possessions than about the
safety of the king.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> All the kings
mentioned followed this political <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i>
for a long time, and led a
happy life under these laws. Besides,
they conquered many nations,
acquired great wealth, adorned the
country with wonderful works and
monuments, and the cities with rich
and varied ornaments."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>We have thought proper to quote
this long passage from Diodorus, because
it clearly shows how the Egyptians
regarded the duties and attributes
of royalty. A limited knowledge
of their sentiments makes us
feel that Diodorus must have faithfully
described the regulations maintained
by the priests from the beginning
of this ancient monarchy. Until
the latest times, that is, till the Roman
conquest, the prince, called to the
throne by his birth, was enthroned
and consecrated in a general assembly
of the priesthood convoked at
Memphis, "in order to observe the
legal ceremonies prescribed for the
coronation."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>When we examine the sacerdotal
order, the influence it exercised over
the king, in keeping him within the
limits of moderation and justice, will
be perceived.</p>

<p>The veneration of the Egyptians
for their kings led them from the
first to render them divine honors.
"Egypt," says M. Mariette, "had a
genuine worship for its kings, whom
they styled beneficent gods, and regarded
as the 'Sons of the Sun.'"</p>

<p>"The ureus (the asp) ornamented
the brows of all the kings. It is also
found adorning the foreheads of some
of the gods. 'The asp does not
grow old,' says Plutarch (Isis and
Osiris), 'and, though without organs
of locomotion, it moves with great
facility.' The Egyptians considered
it as the emblem of the eternal youth
of the sun and its course in the
heavens."</p>

<p>The sentiment of loyalty was carried
so far among the Egyptians that
it was considered a duty to obey their
kings even in the caprices of their
fantasy and pride. They respected
those who were bad while they lived,
reserving the right of judging them
after their death.</p>

<p>"What took place at the death of
their kings was not one of the least
proofs of their attachment to them,
for the honors rendered to the dead
are an incontestable proof of sincerity
of affection. When one of the kings
died, all the inhabitants mourned,
rent their garments, closed the temples,
abstained from sacrifices, and
celebrated no festivals for seventy-two
days. Every one passed the
prescribed number of days in affliction
and mourning, as for the death
of a cherished child. During this
time preparations were made for a magnificent
funeral, and on the last day
they placed the chest containing the
body of the deceased at the entrance
of the tomb. They then proceeded,
according to the law, to pass judgment
on all the king had done during
his life. Every one had the right of
making his accusation. The priests
pronounced a panegyric, relating
the praiseworthy deeds of the king.
Thousands of auditors applauded it
if the king's life had been without
reproach; if otherwise, they expressed
their disapproval by murmurs.
Many kings, through the opposition
of the people, were deprived of suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_819" id="Page_819">[819]</a></span>
burial. This led their successors
to deal justly, not only for reasons
already mentioned, but for fear
their bodies might be treated ignominiously
after death, and their memory
be for ever cursed."<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>"There are still to be seen in
Egypt," says Champollion-Figeac,
"testimonies significant of this custom.
The names of some sovereigns are
carefully effaced from the monuments
they had erected during their reign.
They are carefully hammered down
even on their tombs." Among the
names of the kings thus condemned
after death, Champollion mentions
that of Pharaoh Mandouéi, of the
eighteenth dynasty. Wherever this
name stood, on all representations
of the king, or on the edifices he
had erected, it is carefully effaced
and hammered, though expressed by
the image of the god Mandou, whose
name he bore. The systematic suppression
of this king's name on all
the public monuments can only be
explained as the result of one of
those severe judgments passed by
the Egyptian nation upon wicked
kings after their death.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<p>"There was in Egypt," says Bossuet,
"a kind of judgment, quite
extraordinary, which no one escaped....
This custom of judging kings
after their death appeared so sacred
to the people of God, that they always
practised it. We see in the
Scriptures that wicked kings were
deprived of burial among their ancestors,
and we learn from Josephus
that this custom was still kept up in
the time of the Asmoneans. It led
kings to remember that, if above
human judgment during their lives,
they must be subjected thereto when
death reduced them to the level of
ordinary mortals."<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding so many wise
precautions, the kings of Egypt did
not always pursue the course so
clearly marked out by the national
traditions and the interests of the
nation. More than one Pharaoh,
intoxicated by sovereign authority,
made his subjects experience the
heavy hand of tyranny. The numerous
changes of dynasties (thirty-one
are reckoned before the conquest
by Alexander the Great) also show
that the nation more than once succeeded
in overthrowing the despotic
government of those that abused
their power. But, through all changes
of dynasties, and in spite of the
struggles of rival families, the Egyptians
always remained faithful to the
monarchical principle, indissolubly
attached to its institutions, customs,
and manners. "At no time," says
Herodotus, "have the Egyptians
been able to live without kings."</p>

<h2>MR. CARLYLE AND PÈRE BOUHOURS.</h2>


<p>Crying injustice and endless
heartburnings are caused in social
life by the falsehoods which malicious
or foolish people shelter under
the familiar quotation rubric, "said
he" or "said she." For these we
may charitably and to some extent
allow uncertainty of human memory
to go in extenuation.</p>

<p>Rising above the circle of cackling
gossip, we know that, out of a
dozen witnesses solemnly adjured to
testify as to words spoken in simultaneous
hearing of all the twelve, it
is rare to find any three of them
agreeing as to the precise form of
locution used, even where they accord
as to meaning and signification of
the phrase they report.</p>

<p>We pass from the spoken to the
written word, and are struck with the
fact that, even in literature and in
history, the too common neglect of
conscientious accuracy of citations,
in accepting them at second hand or
from a questionable source, is the
fruitful cause of wrong judgment of
events, false estimate of men, and
uncharitableness without end.</p>

<p>If it is sought to hold a man responsible
for opinions which he has
deliberately written and printed, he
is in justice to be held answerable
solely by his own record, neither
more nor less. No occasion is there
here for conflicting testimony. If
arraigned for those opinions, let the
accusation run&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipsissimis verbis</i>&mdash;with
what he has written. Otherwise,
flaw fatal will be found, and
indictment sternly quashed. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Scripta
manent</i>&mdash;his opinions are recorded,
and no subsequent version may be
heard from him to vary the obligation
therein assumed. Neither, therefore,
in justice, shall you admit adverse
parol testimony in guise of
unfriendly gloss or explanation to
hold him responsible for more than
he has advanced or assumed.</p>

<p>With swift instinct, we all mistrust
reported verbal utterances made by
a man whose prejudice or whose
passion evidently colors his memory
and stimulates his imagination. And,
although the excuse of mistake or
misunderstanding is not admissible
where the repetition or citation of
printed words is concerned, yet,
when a writer is quoted in the spirit
of ridicule, blame, or sarcasm, it
should suffice to put the reader on
inquiry. Before he adopts and thereby
vouches for the attributed phrase,
let him look well to it that the text
is not tampered with, and that the
passage, as given, be not modified&mdash;not
to say changed&mdash;by omission or
addition. A mere comma too much
or too little, as we well know, may
make sad havoc with a sentence,
and turn truth into falsehood.</p>

<p>Old authors, and even some few
careful writers down to the present
day, show their appreciation of this
responsibility in quotation by intrenching
themselves behind an <i>apud</i>
in cases where, from any cause, they
are unable to verify the correctness
of the passage cited; thus throwing
the burden of proof on the reporter
named by them.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of the neglect
of some such precautions as are
here mentioned may be found in a
somewhat familiar citation made&mdash;and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821">[821]</a></span>
we may add, made celebrated&mdash;by
no less a literary authority than
Mr. Carlyle.</p>

<p>It occurs in one of his most admirable
productions, entitled <cite>The State
of German Literature</cite>.</p>

<p>This essay, which originally appeared,
in 1827, as an article in the
<cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, is rich in literary
research and vigorous thought.</p>

<p>It is valuable not only for what it
says concerning German literature,
but concerning all literature, and is
most generally enjoyed and best
remembered by reason of its eloquent
pillorying and remorseless
flagellation of one Père Bouhours,
who, as Mr. Carlyle informs us, propounded
to himself the pregnant
question: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si un Allemand peut avoir
de l'esprit?</i> Indignantly the great
Scotch essayist thus bursts out upon
the unfortunate Frenchman: "Had
the Père Bouhours bethought him of
what country Kepler and Leibnitz
were born, or who it was that gave
to mankind the three great elements
of modern civilization, gunpowder,
printing, and the Protestant religion,
it might have thrown light on his
inquiry. Had he known the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Niebelungen-Lied</i>,
and where <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reinecke-Fuchs</i>,
and <cite>Faust</cite>, and the <cite>Ship of
Fools</cite>, and four-fifths of all the popular
mythology, humor, and romance
to be found in Europe in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries,
took its rise; had he read a page or
two of Ulrich Hutten, Opitz, Paul
Flemming, Logan, or even Lobenstein
and Hoffmanswaldau, all of
whom had already lived and written
even in his day; had the Père Bouhours
taken this trouble, who knows
but he might have found, with whatever
amazement, that a German
could actually have a little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit</i>, or,
perhaps, even something better? No
such trouble was requisite for the
Père Bouhours. Motion <i>in vacuo</i> is
well known to be speedier and surer
than through a resisting medium,
especially to imponderable bodies;
and so the light Jesuit, unimpeded
by facts or principles of any kind,
failed not to reach his conclusions;
and, in a comfortable frame of mind,
to decide negatively that a German
could <em>not</em> have any literary talent."</p>

<p>Now, if Père Bouhours really said
what is here attributed to him, this
fulmination, all obvious as it is, cannot
be looked upon as unprovoked,
and we may listen with sense of satisfied
justice to the dreadful sentence
pronounced upon him, which is substantially
that, incarcerated in the
immortal amber of this one untimely
joke, the helpless Jesuit be doomed
therein to live; "for the blessing of
full oblivion is denied him, and so
he hangs suspended to his own noose,
over the dusky pool which he struggles
toward, but for a great while
will not reach." To these remarks
Mr. Carlyle adds the very sensible
reflection: "For surely the pleasure
of despising, at all times and in itself
a dangerous luxury, is much
safer <em>after</em> the toil of examining than
before it."</p>

<p>This condemnation and sentence
are based on a detached phrase separated
from its contexts, and Mr.
Carlyle fails to tell us in what connection
or in what work was made
the unfortunate speech for which the
French writer is thus beaten with many
stripes.</p>

<p>Might it not be that, read in its
proper relation, his words signify
something very different from the interpretation
placed upon them as
here severed? So true is this that
what Père Bouhours really wrote
has a very different signification.
Investigation demonstrates this and
more, and shows that Père Bouhours
not only did not mean to express
what is here attributed to him, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_822" id="Page_822">[822]</a></span>
he did not even use the words thus
thrust upon him as his own.</p>

<p>Indeed, the ill-used Bouhours is
introduced and dispatched so very
summarily, that the reader of the Edinburgh
essay scarcely obtains more
than a glance of a literary criminal
rapidly judged and sent to swift execution.</p>

<p>Let us see for a moment what
manner of man this Bouhours appeared
to the people of his day and
generation. As then known, he was
a writer of high reputation (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors
ligne</i>) and the author of several works,
some of which are still read and republished.
We find certain of his
books on the shelves of our largest
American libraries, and a few days
since, in looking casually through a
catalogue of publications made (1869)
at the Armenian convent in Venice,
an interesting spot well known to
American travellers, we noted two
editions of Bouhours's <cite>Christian Meditations</cite>,
one in French and one in a
Turkish translation.</p>

<p>Bouhours is also the author of a
French translation of the entire New
Testament, which is remarkable for
its fidelity and its purity of diction.</p>

<p>It is the version adopted by Lallemant
in his <cite>Reflections on the New
Testament</cite>. He also wrote <cite>Remarks
and Doubts concerning the French
Language</cite>, and <cite>Ingenious Thoughts of
the Fathers</cite>. His <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Manière de bien
Penser</i> is held by the best critics to
contain much that evinces acuteness
and delicacy of discrimination. Bouhours
was always quoted and referred
to by his contemporaries with
deference.</p>

<p>His <cite>Life of St. Francis Xavier</cite> was
found worthy of an English translation
by no less a celebrity than
the English poet Dryden; and La
Harpe, who is openly unfriendly to
Bouhours, says of him, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'était un
homme lettré qui savait l'Italien
et l'Espagnol</span>."</p>

<p>The passage incorrectly cited by
Mr. Carlyle occurs in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Entretiens
a'Ariste et d'Eugène</i>, a small duodecimo
volume published in 1671.</p>

<p>These <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Entretiens</i> or conversations
are supposed to be held by two gentlemen
of literary taste, who discuss
a variety of subjects pertaining to
polite literature.</p>

<p>One of these topics is the French
language, which is assumed to be
the best of all modern languages,
possessing, as it does, the secret of
uniting conciseness with clearness,
and purity with politeness. On this
question of his native tongue, the
patriotism of Père Bouhours hurries
him into terms of excessive praise.
The French language, in his opinion,
combines every excellence. The
Spanish he characterizes as a noisy
torrent flooding its banks and overspreading
the country; the Italian,
as a gentle rivulet; the French, a majestic
stream that never quits its level.</p>

<p>The Spanish, again, he compares to
a proud beauty, bold in demeanor
and splendid in attire; the Italian,
to a painted coquette, ever ornamented
for effect; the French, to a modest,
agreeable lady, who, if apparently
prudish, is neither uncivil nor
repulsive. Then, he adds, our own
pronunciation is the most natural
and pleasing.</p>

<p>Patriotism of so warm a character
as this, after elevating French language
and literature so freely at the
expense of the Spanish and Italian,
would hardly be likely to rate the
German very high.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in view of the great
preponderance of heavy though
learned disquisition over that branch
of German literature which might
be classed as polished and witty,
Père Bouhours did really propose
the question,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_823" id="Page_823">[823]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SI UN ALLEMAND PEUT ETRE BEL
ESPRIT</span>?<br />
</p>

<p>&mdash;a proposition very far from identical
with that which is attributed
to him by Mr. Carlyle, namely:</p>

<p class="center">
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SI UN ALLEMAND PEUT AVOIR DE
L'ESPRIT</span>?<br />
</p>

<p>The variation simply being that
Bouhours did not, as here alleged, decide
negatively that a German could
not have any literary talent, but queried
if a German could be a wit.</p>

<p>Truly a distinction with a difference.</p>

<p>Hallam, seldom incorrect in such
matters, presents the matter fairly
in stating that the Père Bouhours
"proposed the question whether a
German can by the nature of things
possess any wit."</p>

<p>The misrepresentation made is a
serious one, and the citation as corrected
deprives Mr. Carlyle's thunder of
its noise, and extracts from his sarcasm
all its sting.</p>

<p>We believe it was Thackeray who
said that, notwithstanding his profound
respect and deep veneration
for the twelve apostles, they really
were not the sort of persons he
should care to invite to a festive
dinner party.</p>

<p>Père Bouhours would doubtless,
as readily as Mr. Carlyle, concede to
Kepler and Leibnitz all the merit
the most enthusiastic German could
claim for these great men as shining
lights of science, but would hardly
credit them with the ability to write
the <cite>Xenien</cite> or edit the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kladderadatsch</i>.</p>

<p>When Bouhours published his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Entretiens</i>,
it is very certain that, if German
literature shone in wit, the fact
was not known west of the Rhine.
Indeed, Mr. Carlyle himself, a few
paragraphs further on, unconsciously
records the fullest vindication of
Père Bouhours. With a patriotism
quite as fervent as that of his victim,
he informs us that "centuries ago
translations from the German were
comparatively frequent in England,"
but to support this statement can
only cite <cite>Luther's Table Talk</cite> and
<cite>Jacob Boehme</cite>. Enumeration most
scant and melancholy! The essayist
then goes on to say: "In the
next century, indeed, translation ceased;
but then it was, in a great measure,
<i>because there was little worth
translating</i>. The horrors of the
Thirty Years' War had desolated
the country; French influence, extending
from the courts of princes
to the closets of the learned, lay
like a baleful incubus over the far
nobler ruins of Germany; and all
free nationality vanished from its
literature, or was heard only in faint
tones, which lived in the hearts of
the people, <i>but could not reach with
any effect to the ears of foreigners</i>."</p>

<p>But as though not satisfied with
a general statement which should
justify Père Bouhours, Mr. Carlyle
continues until he makes the justification
clear in terms and specific by
dates, telling us: "From the time of
Opitz and Flemming to that of Klopstock
and Lessing, that is, from the
early part of the seventeenth to the
middle of the eighteenth century,
they [the Germans] had scarcely any
literature known abroad, <i>or deserving
to be known</i>."</p>

<p>Now, Dominic Bouhours, born in
Paris, 1628, asked the famous question,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Si un Allemand peut être bel
esprit?</i> in 1671, and died in 1702.
Thus his earthly career was comprised
precisely within the period
specified by Mr. Carlyle as that during
which the Germans were without
not only <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>, but any
literature whatever deserving to be
known.</p>

<p>But, going back to the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824">[824]</a></span>
ages, Mr. Carlyle, strangely enough
holds Bouhours responsible, because
of his want of familiarity with the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Niebelungen-Lied</i>, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Reinecke-Fuchs</i>, and
other monuments of early German
literature. "Had he known the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Niebelungen-Lied</i>" is asked mockingly.
This is hardly just, when we
reflect that no one better than Mr.
Carlyle knows that Germany of the
Bouhours period was itself, in the
main, ignorant of and profoundly
indifferent to the merits of these remarkable
productions. Only long
years afterward, following on ages of
oblivion as to their very existence in
their own country, were they brought
to light, and it is principally owing
to the exertions of the comparatively
new Romantic school that modern
Germany has been made acquainted
with the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Niebelungen-Lied</i> and other
great middle-age poems.</p>

<p>It is true that Bodmer in Switzerland
first put a portion of the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Niebelungen</i>
("Chrimhilde's Revenge") in
print, in 1757; but, as Mr. Carlyle
has elsewhere informed us, it was
August Wilhelm Schlegel who "succeeded
in awakening something like
a universal popular feeling on the
subject," and he refers to this and
the like poems as "manuscripts that
for ages have lain dormant," and
now come "from their archives into
public view," "a phenomenon unexpected
till of late"&mdash;stating that "the
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Niebelungen</i> is welcomed as a precious
national possession&mdash;<i>recovered
after six centuries of neglect</i>." From
which it would appear that, at his
peril, Bouhours, in 1671, must be familiar
with "a precious national possession"
of the Germans, which they
themselves, before and after that
period, treated with "centuries of
neglect." Being a Jesuit, it is, of
course, eminently proper, according
to a time-honored custom in English
literature, that he should be made
responsible for everything&mdash;the Spanish
Inquisition and Original Sin included.</p>

<p>Mr. Carlyle patriotically closes his
eyes to English ignorance and indifference
touching German literature,
even when claiming for Great Britain
only a lesser density of ignorance
concerning it than afflicted France.</p>

<p>Writing as late as 1827, he fairly
admits that the literature and character
of Germany "are still very generally
unknown to us, or, what is
worse, misknown," that its "false
and tawdry ware" reached England
before "the chaste and truly excellent,"
and that "Kotzebue's insanity
spread faster by some fifty years
than Lessing's wisdom." And the
British ignorance, it is admitted, is
not confined to German literature.
"For what more do we know"&mdash;thus
Mr. Carlyle clinches the question&mdash;"of
recent Spanish or Italian
literature than of German; of Grossi
and Manzoni, of Campomanos or
Jovellanos, than of Tieck and Richter?"</p>

<p>Really, when we contemplate the
enlightened Englishman of 1827
thus held up to our gaze, how can we
withhold from the abused Frenchman
of 1671 our profound admiration?</p>

<p>Now, if, on reflection, Mr. Carlyle
estimates the imputation on German
literature of a lack of wit and humor
as a serious offence&mdash;if he considers
actionable and punishable Father
Bouhours's query,</p>

<p class="center">
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">SI UN ALLEMAND PEUT ETRE BEL
ESPRIT</span>?<br />
</p>

<p>he need not go back two centuries
for a criminal of whom to make an
example. We have in custody for
him one of this century&mdash;of this
decade&mdash;nay, of this very year. He
is a living culprit, and, moreover, a
distinguished one. Here is a copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_825" id="Page_825">[825]</a></span>
of the words in which he offends, and,
if we are not mistaken, he may be
found in Mr. Carlyle's bailiwick:
"There is, perhaps, no nation where
the general standard of wit and humor
is so low as with the Germans&mdash;no
other people at least are so
easily entertained with indifferent
jokes" (<cite>Saturday Review</cite>, London,
March 18, 1871).</p>

<h2>OUR LADY OF LOURDES.</h2>

<p class="center">FROM THE FRENCH OF HENRI LASSERRE.</p>


<h3>PART IX.<br />

VII.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang">PASTORAL LETTER OF THE BISHOP OF
TARBES, GIVING HIS DECISION REGARDING
THE APPARITIONS WHICH TOOK
PLACE AT THE GROTTO OF LOURDES.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Bertrand-Severe Laurence</span>, by the
divine mercy, and the favor of the Apostolic
See, Bishop of Tarbes, Assistant at
the Pontifical Throne, etc. To the clergy
and faithful of our diocese, health and
benediction in our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"Beloved co-laborers and most dear
brethren: In all epochs of humanity, marvellous
communications have taken place
between earth and heaven. At the commencement
of the world, the Lord appeared
to our first parents to reproach
them with their disobedience. During
the ages which succeeded, we see him
conversing with the patriarchs and prophets.
The Old Testament is often nothing
more than a history of the heavenly
apparitions with which the children of
Israel were favored. These favors did
not cease with the Mosaic law; on the
contrary, they became, under the law of
grace, more striking, more numerous.
In the infancy of the church, those times
of bloody persecution, the Christians received
visits from Jesus Christ and the
angels, who came, sometimes, to reveal
to them secrets of the future or to deliver
them from their chains; at other times,
to strengthen them for combat. Thus it
was, according to a judicious writer, that
God encouraged those illustrious confessors
of the faith, when the powers of earth
united to strangle in its cradle that truth
which was to save the world.</p>

<p>"These manifestations from the other
world were not the exclusive lot of the
first centuries of Christianity. History
attests that they have been continued
from age to age, for the glory of religion
and the edification of the faithful. Among
these heavenly apparitions, those of the
Blessed Virgin occupy a prominent place,
and have been an abundant source of
blessing to the world. As the traveller
journeys over that part of the earth
which has been the home of Christianity,
he everywhere meets temples consecrated
to the Mother of God; and many of them
owe their origin to an apparition of the
Queen of heaven. We already possess
one of these blessed sanctuaries, founded
four centuries ago, on account of revelations
made to a young shepherdess,
where thousands of pilgrims repair yearly
to kneel before the throne of the glorious
Virgin Mother Mary to implore her
for special favors.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>"Thanks be to God Almighty!&mdash;for,
among the treasures of his infinite bounty,
he has reserved for us another favor. He
desires that, in our diocese of Tarbes, a
new sanctuary should rise to the glory of
Mary. And what instrument has he made
use of to communicate his merciful designs?
One which would be the very
weakest in the eyes of the world&mdash;a child
of fourteen years, Bernadette Soubirous,
one of the daughters of a poor family of
Lourdes."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the bishop gives a summary
of the apparitions. The reader is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_826" id="Page_826">[826]</a></span>aware of them already. Mgr. Laurence
then proceeds to discuss the
facts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such, in substance," he further continues,
"is the account we ourselves
heard from Bernadette, before the commissioners
assembled to re-examine the
affair.</p>

<p>"Thus, this young girl has seen a being
calling herself the Immaculate Conception,
who, although appearing in human
form, was neither seen nor heard by any
of the numerous spectators present at the
scene. It was consequently some kind
of a supernatural being. What is to be
thought of such an event?</p>

<p>"You are well aware, dearly beloved
brethren, that the church exercises a wise
deliberation in determining supernatural
facts, and that she demands certain proof
before admitting them to be divine. Since
the original fall, man has been liable to
many errors, particularly in this matter.
If not led astray by his reason, now weakened,
he has suffered himself to become
the dupe of the evil one. Who does not
know that the devil sometimes transforms
himself into an angel of light, in order
to draw us into his snares? Thus the
beloved disciple warns us not to believe
every spirit, but to try the spirits if they
come from God. This trial we have
made. The event of which we are treating
has been, for four years, the object
of our solicitude; we have followed it
throughout its various phases. We have
consulted the commission, made up of
pious, learned, and experienced priests,
who have examined facts, questioned the
little girl, weighed and deliberated concerning
all. We have, also, invoked the
authority of science, and remain firmly
convinced that the apparition was supernatural
and divine, and, consequently,
that what Bernadette saw was really and
truly the Most Blessed Virgin Mary.
Our conviction is based upon the testimony
of Bernadette, but, more especially,
upon the events which have transpired,
and which can be explained only by supposing
some heavenly intervention.</p>

<p>"The testimony of the little girl affords
all the security that can be desired. Her
sincerity cannot be doubted. No one
who comes in contact with her can fail to
admire her childish simplicity, candor,
and modesty. While everybody is engaged
in discussing these marvels, she
keeps silence; she speaks only when
questioned, and then relates everything
without affectation, and with touching ingenuousness.
She returns unhesitating,
clear, and precise answers to the questions
which are put to her, and conveys
the impression of most perfect conviction
of what she says.</p>

<p>"Though subjected to rude trials, she
has never been shaken by threats. The
most generous offers she has rejected
with perfect disinterestedness. Always
perfectly consistent, she has maintained
her original statements throughout the
numberless examinations she has undergone,
without adding or withdrawing
anything. The sincerity of Bernadette
is, therefore, incontestable. We may add,
it is uncontested. Those who have opposed
her have rendered her this homage
at least.</p>

<p>"But, admitting that she has not intended
to deceive others, has she not
been herself deceived? Has she not imagined
that she saw something where
nothing, in fact, existed? Has she not been
the victim of a hallucination? The good
sense displayed in her answers reveals an
accurate mind, a quiet imagination, and
a sound judgment, surpassing her age.
Her religious sentiments have never possessed
the character of enthusiasm; nothing
has been remarked about the young
girl indicating intellectual disorder, or any
eccentricity of character, any alteration
of the senses or morbid affection which
predispose her to imaginations of this
kind. She has had this vision, not once,
but eighteen times; then, it has appeared
suddenly, when nothing could have prepared
her for what was about to take
place; and, during the fortnight when she
daily expected it, she saw nothing for two
days, though placed in circumstances entirely
similar to those of the previous
occasion.</p>

<p>"But what took place during the time
of these apparitions? A complete transformation
was effected in Bernadette herself.
Her countenance assumed a new
expression, her features were lit up; she
saw things which she had never seen before,
and heard a language which she
does not ordinarily understand, but of
which she preserved the memory. These
combined circumstances do not admit
the possibility of hallucination. The
little girl has really seen and heard a
being who calls herself the Immaculate
Conception; and, since we cannot explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_827" id="Page_827">[827]</a></span>
this phenomenon naturally, we are
forced to attribute it to a supernatural
cause.</p>

<p>"The testimony of Bernadette derives
additional force, its confirmation, we
should say, from the wonderful events
which have accompanied it throughout.</p>

<p>"If the tree is to be judged by its fruits,
we can certainly say that the apparition
described by the little girl is supernatural
and divine. For it has produced supernatural
and divine effects. What, then,
has happened, dearly beloved? Scarcely
was the apparition made known, when
the news spread with the rapidity of
lightning. It was known that Bernadette
was to visit the grotto daily for a fortnight.
The whole land is astir. Streams
of people flow to the place of apparition.
They await, with religious impatience, the
solemn hour. And when the girl appears,
rapt and absorbed in the object of her
ecstasy, the witnesses of this prodigy,
moved and softened, are melted in a sentiment
of admiration and prayer. The
apparitions have now ceased, but the
throng continues. Pilgrims come from
distant lands. Every age and rank and
condition is to be seen kneeling before
the grotto. What sentiment moves these
countless visitors? Ah! they come to the
grotto to implore the special help of the
Immaculate Mary. They prove by their
recollected mien that they breathe the
divine atmosphere which surrounds these
hallowed rocks, already become famous.
Christian souls are strengthened in virtue;
men frozen up by indifference are
brought back to the practice of religion;
hardened sinners are reconciled to God
when Our Lady of Lourdes has been invoked
in their behalf. These wonders of
grace, which are complete and lasting,
can have no author save God. Do they
not strikingly confirm the truth of the
apparitions? If we now pass from effects
wrought for the salvation of souls to
those which concern the healing of bodily
ills, how many prodigies must we not
recount?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Our readers have not forgotten the
breaking forth of the spring, at which
Bernadette drank and washed, before
the assembled crowds. It will
be superfluous to repeat these details.
The bishop continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sick persons have made use of the
water, and not without success. Many,
whose diseases have resisted most energetic
treatment, have suddenly recovered
health. These extraordinary cures have
been noised abroad. Invalids from all
quarters have sent for this Massabielle
water, when unable to transport themselves
to the grotto.</p>

<p>"How many infirm have been cured,
how many afflicted families have been
consoled!</p>

<p>"If we wished to call for their testimony,
countless voices would be lifted up
in acknowledgment of the sovereign efficacy
of this water. We cannot here
enumerate all the favors obtained; but
what we are obliged to say, is, that the
Massabielle water has cured desperate
invalids who had been declared incurable.
These cures have been worked by
the use of water devoid of any healing
properties, according to the acknowledgments
of skilful chemists, after rigorous
analysis. Some cures have been wrought
instantaneously, others after using the
water twice or thrice as a drink or lotion.
Moreover, these cures are permanent.
What power has wrought them? Some
organic power? Science answers negatively.
They are, therefore, the work of
God. But, they refer to the apparitions;
these are their source; these have inspired
the sick people with confidence. Hence,
there is an intimate connection between
the cures and the apparitions. The apparition
is divine, because the cures bear
the seal of divine power. But that which
comes from God is true; and, therefore,
the apparition which Bernadette saw and
heard, and which gave itself the name of
the Immaculate Conception, is the Blessed
Virgin herself. Well may we cry out:
The finger of God is here! <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Digitus Dei
est hic.</i></p>

<p>"How, then, can any one fail to admire
the economy of divine Providence?
At the end of the year 1854, the immortal
Pius IX. proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate
Conception. The whole earth re-echoed
the words of its supreme pastor;
Catholic hearts trembled with joy, and
everywhere the glorious privilege of Mary
was celebrated by <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fêtes</i>, which will
ever remain graven in the memory of
those who witnessed them. And, behold,
three years afterward, the Blessed Virgin
appears to one of our children, and says:
I am the Immaculate Conception: here
will I have a chapel built in my honor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_828" id="Page_828">[828]</a></span>
Does she not seem to desire to consecrate
by this monument the infallible
oracle of St. Peter?</p>

<p>"Where will she have this monument
erected? At the foot of our own Pyrenees,
where many strangers meet from all parts
of the world to seek health at our waters.
May we not say that she invites the faithful
of all nations to come and honor her in
the new temple which shall be built to her?</p>

<p>"Citizens of Lourdes, rejoice! The
august Mary condescends to cast upon
you her merciful eyes. She desires to
build beside your walls a sanctuary stored
with blessings. Thank her for this token
of predilection; and, since she lavishes
her motherly tenderness upon you, show
yourselves her children by imitating her
virtues, and by a fixed attachment to religion.</p>

<p>"It is with joy that we acknowledge
the fruits of salvation which the apparition
has already caused to spring up
abundantly among you. Eye-witnesses
of the events at the grotto and their happy
results, your confidence has been as
great as your conviction has been strong.
We have ever admired your prudence
and docility in following our counsels of
obedience and submission to the civil
authority, when for some weeks you were
hindered from visiting the grotto, and
were forced to restrain in your own hearts
the sentiments inspired by what you had
there beheld during the fortnight of the
apparitions.</p>

<p>"And you, our well-beloved children,
open your hearts to hope. A new era of
grace and benediction has dawned upon
you; you are called to share in what has
been promised to all. In your prayers
and canticles, henceforth, you will mingle
the name of Our Lady of Lourdes
with the blessed titles of Our Lady of
Garaison, of Poeylaün, of Héas, and of
Piétat.</p>

<p>"From these sanctuaries the Immaculate
Virgin will watch over you, and
cover you with the shield of her protection.
Yes, beloved co-laborers and dearest
brethren, if, with hearts full of confidence,
we fix our glance upon this 'Star
of the Sea,' we shall pass without fear of
shipwreck through the tempests of life, and
arrive safely in the haven of eternal bliss.</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">WHEREFORE</span>:<br />
</p>

<p>"Having consulted with our venerable
brethren, the dignitaries, canons, and
chapter of our cathedral church;</p>

<p>"The holy name of God having been
invoked; following the rules laid down
by Benedict XIV., in his work on <cite>Beatification
and Canonization of Saints</cite>, for
discerning true and false apparitions;
seeing the favorable report of the commission
charged with the examination of
the apparition at the grotto of Lourdes,
and the facts connected with it;</p>

<p>"Seeing the written testimony of the
medical doctors, whom we have consulted
in reference to the numerous cures
obtained by use of water from this grotto;</p>

<p>"Considering, in the first place, that
the fact of the apparition, whether in regard
to the effects produced upon her
who saw it, or its other extraordinary results,
cannot be explained by natural
means;</p>

<p>"Considering, secondly, that the cause
cannot be other than divine, by reason
of the effects which have followed its
operation, such as the conversion of sinners
and derogation from the fixed laws
of nature, namely, miraculous cures,
which can only come from him who is
the author of grace and nature;</p>

<p>"Considering, finally, that our own
conviction is strengthened by the immense
and spontaneous concourse of the
faithful, which has never ceased at the
grotto since the first apparitions, and
whose only object is to implore favors or
return thanks for those which have been
already obtained;</p>

<p>"In response to the just impatience of
our venerable chapter, of the clergy and
laity of our diocese, and of so many pious
souls who have long been calling
upon the ecclesiastical authority for a
decision which prudence has caused us
hitherto to refrain from giving;</p>

<p>"Desiring, also, to satisfy the wishes

<p>"Having invoked the light of the
Holy Ghost, and the assistance of the

<p class="center">
WE HAVE DECLARED, AND HEREBY
DECLARE AS FOLLOWS:<br />
</p>

<p>"Art. 1. We, decide that the Immaculate
Mary, the Mother of God, really did
appear to Bernadette Soubirous, on the
eleventh of February, 1858, and on several
days following, altogether eighteen
times, in the Massabielle Grotto, near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_829" id="Page_829">[829]</a></span>
town of Lourdes; that this apparition has
every guarantee of truth, and that the
faithful have solid reason for believing it
to be certain.</p>

<p>"We submit ourselves humbly to the
judgment of the Sovereign Pontiff, to
whom belongs the government of the
universal church.</p>

<p>"Art. 2. We authorize in our diocese
the worship of Our Lady of the Grotto
of Lourdes; but we prohibit any particular
prayers, any canticle, any book of devotion,
to be published on this subject
without our written approbation.</p>

<p>"Art. 3. In conformity with the desire
of the Blessed Virgin, several times expressed
during her apparitions, we propose
to build a shrine on the site of the
grotto, which has now become the property
of the Bishop of Tarbes.</p>

<p>"This edifice, on account of its steep
and rocky foundation, will require great
labor and expense. We need, therefore,
to carry out our design, the assistance of
the priests and faithful of our own diocese,
of our country, France, and also
from abroad. We appeal to all generous
hearts, and particularly to all persons of
every country who are devoted to the
worship of the Immaculate Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>"Art. 4. We address with confidence
all institutions of either sex consecrated
to the education of youth, to the congregations
of the 'Children of Mary,' to the
confraternities of the Blessed Virgin, and
other pious societies of our own diocese,
and throughout France.</p>

<p>"This, our pastoral, shall be read and
published in all the churches, chapels, seminaries,
colleges, and hospices of our diocese
on the Sunday following its reception.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>In the name of his see, or, rather,
in that of the church, Mgr. Laurence
purchased from the town of Lourdes
the grotto and the surrounding lands,
and the whole group of Massabielle
rocks. M. Lacadé was still mayor.
He it was who proposed to the municipal
council to cede to the church,
the bride of Christ, those places
which had been consecrated for ever
by the appearance of his heavenly
Mother. He, also, signed the deed
of transfer.</p>

<p>M. Rouland authorized the sale,
and also the erection of a church in
perpetual memory of the apparition
of the Blessed Virgin to Bernadette
Soubirous, in memory of the fountain
and the numberless miracles
which had attested the heavenly visions.</p>

<p>While the vast temple dedicated
to the Immaculate Conception was
slowly rising, stone upon stone, Our
Lady of Lourdes continued to shower
blessings and graces upon her
clients. At Paris and Bordeaux, in
Perigord, Brittany, and Anjou, amid
solitary and rural scenes and in the
heart of popular cities, Our Lady of
Lourdes was invoked, and answered
with unquestionable signs of her
power and goodness.</p>

<p>Before closing our recital and presenting
the picture of things as they
now exist, let us narrate two of these
divine histories. One of them forms
an episode in the life of the writer
of these pages which nothing can
ever efface from his memory. We
give it as we wrote it down nearly
seven years ago.</p>


<h3>PART X.<br />

I.</h3>

<p>During my whole life, I had always
enjoyed the blessing of good sight.
I was able to distinguish objects at a
great distance, and also to read with
ease when my book was close to my
eyes. I never suffered the least
weakness of sight after whole nights
passed in study. I often wondered
and rejoiced at the strength and
clearness of my vision. Thus, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830">[830]</a></span>
a great surprise and a cruel disenchantment
when in June and July,
1862, I felt my eyesight becoming
gradually weak, unable to work at
night, and, finally, incapable of any
use, so that I was obliged to give up
altogether reading and writing. If
I chanced to pick up a book, after
reading three or four lines, sometimes
at the first glance, I felt such
weakness in the upper part of my
eyes as to render it impossible to
continue. I consulted several physicians,
and principally the two famous
oculists, Desmares and Giraud-Teulon.</p>

<p>The remedies prescribed by them
were of little or no avail. After a
slight rest, and a treatment principally
composed of iron, I had a slight
respite, and once read during a considerable
portion of the afternoon.
But, the following day, I relapsed
into my former condition. Then I
began to try local remedies, applications
of cold water on the ball of
the eye, cupping on the neck, a general
hydropathic treatment, and
alcoholic lotions around the eyes.
Sometimes I experienced a slight relief
from the weariness which generally
oppressed them, but this was only
for a moment. In short, my disease
assumed all the appearances of a
chronic and incurable malady.</p>

<p>According to advice, I condemned
my eyes to absolute repose. Not
content with putting on blue eye-glasses,
I had left Paris, and was living
in the country with my mother,
at Coux, on the banks of the Dordogne.
I had taken with me a young
person, who acted as my secretary,
writing at my dictation, and who
read to me the books which I wished
to consult.</p>

<p>September had arrived. This
state had lasted for three months. I
began to be seriously alarmed. I
felt a gloomy foreboding which I dared
not communicate to any one. My
family shared the same apprehensions,
but likewise shrank from manifesting
them. We were both convinced
that my sight was gone, but
both sought to reassure one another,
and to conceal our mutual anxiety.</p>

<p>I had a most intimate friend, in
whom I had confided from boyhood
all my joys and sorrows. I dictated
to my secretary a letter to him, in
which I described my sad condition,
and the fears which I had for the future.
The friend of whom I speak is a
Protestant, as is also his wife. This
twofold circumstance requires to be
mentioned. Grave reasons prevent
me from giving his name. We shall
call him M. de &mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>He answered my letter a few days
afterward. His letter reached me on
the fifteenth of September, and surprised
me greatly. I transcribe it
here, without changing a word:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>: Your few lines
gave me great pleasure; but, as I
have told you before, I long to hear
from you in <i>your own handwriting</i>.
A few days ago, as I returned from
Cauterets, I passed through Lourdes
(in the neighborhood of Tarbes). I
visited the famous grotto, and heard
about the extraordinary things that
have been taking place there, and
the cures produced by the waters in
cases of diseased eyes. I earnestly
recommend you to try it. If I were
like you, a believing Catholic, and laboring
under any illness, I would certainly
try this chance. If it be true
that invalids have been suddenly cured,
perhaps your name may swell the
number. If it be not true, where is
the risk? I may add that I am personally
interested in this matter. If
the experiment succeeds, what an
important fact for me to face! I
would be in the presence of a miraculous
event, or, at any rate, an event<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_831" id="Page_831">[831]</a></span>
whose principal witness would be
above all suspicion."</p>

<p>"It appears," he added in post-script,
"that it is not necessary to go
to Lourdes itself to take the water
there, since you can have it sent.
It is only necessary to ask the curé
of Lourdes; he will forward it without
delay. Certain conditions have
to be fulfilled of which I am not
perfectly informed, but of which the
curé of Lourdes will tell you. Ask
him also to send you the little pamphlet
by the vicar-general of Tarbes,
which gives an account of the miracles
that have been most thoroughly
proved."</p>

<p>This letter of my friend was well
calculated to fill me with astonishment.
His was an exact, positive, and
at the same time a lofty mind, not at
all liable to the illusions of enthusiasm,
and, besides, he was a Protestant.
Such a piece of advice coming from
him, in such an urgent manner, filled
me with amazement. However, I
resolved not to follow it.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," I replied, "that
I am to-day a little better. If this
improvement continues, I shall not
have need of your proposed and extraordinary
remedy, for which, besides,
I have not, perhaps, the necessary
faith."</p>

<p>And here, I must confess, not
without a blush, the secret motives of
my resistance.</p>

<p>Whatever I may have said, it was
not faith which was lacking; and, although
ignorant of particulars concerning
the water of Lourdes, except
through the impertinent remarks of
certain ill-disposed journals, I was
certain that the power of God could
be manifested by cures here as well
as elsewhere. I will say more: I had
a secret presentiment that if I tried
this water, springing, as some said,
in consequence of an apparition
of the Blessed Virgin, I should be
cured. But, to tell the simple truth,
I feared the responsibility of such a
favor. "If the doctor cures you,"
I said to myself, "every account is
squared as soon as you have handed
him his fee. You will be in the same
condition as everybody else. But if
God cures you by a special act of
his providence, it will be quite another
affair, and you will have to
amend your life and become a saint.
If God gives you back those eyes of
yours with his own hands, how can you
ever let them rest upon objects which
draw you away from him? God will
demand his fee; and it will amount to
more than the doctor's. You must
give up this and that bad habit, you
must acquire such and such virtues,
and others that you know nothing of.
How will you do all this? Ah!
this is too hard!" And my miserable
heart, fearing its own weakness,
nevertheless resisted the grace
of God.</p>

<p>Thus it was I rebelled against the
counsel given me to have recourse
to this miraculous intervention&mdash;against
that counsel which Providence,
ever hidden in its ways, sent
me by two Protestants, two heretics,
outside the church. But my struggles
and resistance were vain. An
interior voice told me that the hand
of man was powerless to cure me,
and that the Master whom I had offended
would return me my sight,
and lead me to a new life, if I would
make up my mind to use it well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my condition was either
stationary or slowly becoming worse.</p>

<p>In the early part of October, I was
obliged to go to Paris. By an unlooked-for
chance, M. de &mdash;&mdash; and
his wife were there at the same time.
My first visit was to them. My
friend was staying at his sister's,
Madame P&mdash;&mdash;, who lived, together
with her husband, in Paris.</p>

<p>"And how are your eyes?" asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832">[832]</a></span>
Madame de &mdash;&mdash; as soon as I had
entered the parlor.</p>

<p>"They are always in the same condition;
I begin to fear that they are
gone."</p>

<p>"But why have you not tried the
remedy that I proposed? I have
a strange hope that you will be cured."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" I replied; "I confess
that, without precisely denying or
showing myself hostile, I have but little
faith in this water and apparition.
It is perfectly possible, I admit; but
as I have not examined the matter, I
neither assert nor contest; I wash my
hands of the whole affair, and do not
intend to have anything to do with
it."</p>

<p>"You have no valid objections," he
answered. "According to your religious
principles, you are bound to
believe at least the possibility of such
things. Very well, then, what is to
prevent you from making a trial?
What is it going to cost you? It
can't do you any harm, for it is nothing
but natural water. Now, since
you believe in miracles and in your
religion, it seems to me that you
ought to be moved by two Protestants;
and I frankly confess that, if
you are cured, it will be a terrible
argument against me." Madame
de &mdash;&mdash; joined her entreaties to those
of her husband. M. and Madame
P&mdash;&mdash;, who are Catholics, insisted as
warmly. I was driven to my last
entrenchments.</p>

<p>"Well," said I at last, "let me tell
you the whole truth. I do not lack
faith, but I am full of weaknesses,
faults, and a thousand miseries which
are entwined with the most sensitive
fibres of my nature. Now, a miracle
would lay upon me the obligation
of giving up everything and trying
to become a saint; and I do not feel
equal to the responsibility. If God
cures me, how do I know what he
will ask of me? But if the doctor
succeeds, we can settle the matter
with money. You think this is disgraceful,
I know; but it is nothing
but the truth. You have supposed
that my faith has been wavering.
You have thought that I feared lest
the miracle should not succeed. It
is not so. I should be only afraid
that it might succeed."</p>

<p>My friends vainly tried to convince
me that I was exaggerating the responsibility
of which I spoke.</p>

<p>"You are none the less obliged to
seek after virtue now than if the miracle
had been already worked," said
M. de &mdash;&mdash;. "Besides, supposing
the physician does cure you, it will
be none the less a favor from God;
and you will have just the same reasons
for struggling against your faults
and passions."</p>

<p>This did not seem to me perfectly
true; and the logical mind of M.
de &mdash;&mdash; probably admitted as much
to itself; but he was bent upon
calming my apprehensions and inducing
me to follow his advice.</p>

<p>Vainly did I endeavor to combat
the pressing earnestness of my host
and his wife, and my friends. I ended
by promising to do whatever they
desired.</p>

<p>"As soon as I get a secretary, I
will write to Lourdes; but it is too
late at this hour of the day."</p>

<p>"But I will do, will I not?" answered
my friend.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I, "come and
breakfast with me to-morrow at the
<i>Café de Foy</i>. I will dictate the letter
after breakfast."</p>

<p>"Why not do it now? We will
save one day."</p>

<p>Paper and ink were at hand. I
dictated a letter to the curé of Lourdes.
It was posted that evening.</p>

<p>The next day, M. de &mdash;&mdash; came
to see me. "My dear friend," he
said, "since the die is cast, and you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_833" id="Page_833">[833]</a></span>
are going to try this experiment, you
ought to go seriously to work, and
fulfil the conditions which are required
in order to make a success. You
must pray. You will have to go to
confession, and put your mind in the
proper state. You know that all this
is a prime necessity."</p>

<p>"You are right," I replied; "I will
do as you say. But you must acknowledge
that you are a queer Protestant.
The tables are turned; to-day
you are preaching to me my
own faith and religion, and I own
the contrast is not much to my advantage."</p>

<p>"I am a man of science," he answered.
"It is perfectly natural that
I should wish to see all the conditions
carried out, since we have
agreed to try an experiment. I
should act in this manner if we were
dealing with physics or chemistry."</p>

<p>I confess, to my shame, I did not
prepare myself as my friend had so
wisely advised me. I was in a very
poor spiritual condition; my soul
was distracted and turned to evil.
I recognized the necessity of throwing
myself at the feet of God; but,
as I had not been guilty of gross
and brutal sins, against which nature
reacts with such violence, I delayed
from day to day. Man is more rebellious
against the sacrament of penance
while he is being tempted, than
after he has been crushed and humbled
by the sight of his crime. It is
more difficult to combat and resist
than to ask for mercy after defeat.
Who does not know this?</p>

<p>A week passed in this manner.
M. and Mme. de &mdash;&mdash; inquired daily
if I had heard any news of the miraculous
water, or any word from the
curé of Lourdes. Finally, I received
a note from him to the effect that
the water had been forwarded by
rail, and would shortly reach me.</p>

<p>We awaited its arrival with great
eagerness; but, strange to say, my
Protestant friends were much more
impatient than I. The state of my
eyes continued the same. It was absolutely
impossible for me to read
or write.</p>

<p>One morning, Friday, October 10,
1862, I was waiting for M. de &mdash;&mdash;
in the Orleans Gallery at the Palais
Royal. We breakfasted together.
As I had come to the place of meeting
some time in advance of him,
I employed myself in looking about
the shops and reading the list of
new books in front of Dentu's library.
This was enough to weary
my eyes. They had become so weak
that I could not let them rest upon
the largest signs without feeling them
overpowered by lassitude. This little
circumstance made me quite sad,
as it showed me the extent of my
malady.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I dictated three
letters to De &mdash;&mdash;, and, at four
o'clock, having left him, returned to
my lodgings. As I was going up-stairs,
the porter called to me.</p>

<p>"A little box has come for you
from the railroad." I entered his
store-room eagerly. There was a
small pine box, bearing my name and
address on one end, and on the other
these words, doubtless intended
for the custom-house officials, "Natural
Water."</p>

<p>It was from Lourdes.</p>

<p>I felt greatly excited; but did not
betray any emotion.</p>

<p>"Very well," said I to the porter,
"I will take it in a few moments; I
will return shortly." I stepped out
again into the street.</p>

<p>"This matter is becoming serious,"
I said to myself. "De &mdash;&mdash; is right;
I must prepare myself. In my present
state, I have no right to ask God
to work a miracle. I must set to
work to heal my own soul before I
can ask him to heal my body."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834">[834]</a></span></p>

<p>Reflecting on these considerations,
I directed my steps toward the house
of my confessor, the Abbé Ferrand de
Missol, who lived quite near me. I
felt certain of finding him in, for it
was Friday, and he is always at home
on that day. So indeed he was
upon this occasion.</p>

<p>But several persons were waiting
to see him, whose turn would naturally
come before mine. Some member
of his family had just arrived on
an unexpected visit. His servant
informed me of all this, and asked me
to call again in the evening about
seven o'clock.</p>

<p>I resigned myself to my lot.</p>

<p>As I came to the street-door, I
paused for an instant. I wavered
between the desire of paying a visit
which I had greatly at heart and the
thought of returning home to pray.
I was very much inclined to the distraction,
but finally the good inspiration
carried the day, and I returned
toward the Rue Seine.</p>

<p>I took from the porter the little
box, to which was attached a notice
of the apparition at Lourdes, and,
with both in my hand, I hastened up-stairs.
On reaching my room, I
knelt down at my bedside and prayed,
all unworthy as I was to turn my
eyes toward heaven. Then I arose.
On entering, I had placed the little
box and the pamphlet upon the mantelpiece.
I gazed a moment upon
the little case which contained the
mysterious water, and it seemed
to me that some great event was
about to transpire in this lonely
chamber. I feared to touch with
impure hands the wood which contained
this hallowed water, and yet,
on the other hand, I felt a lively desire
to open it at once, and not wait
until after I had been to confession.
This indecision lasted for a few moments,
and ended with this prayer:</p>

<p>"O my God! I am a wretched sinner,
unworthy of raising my voice to
you, or of touching that which you
have blessed. But this very excess
of misery ought to excite your compassion.
My God, I come to you
and to the Most Blessed Virgin
Mary, full of faith and reliance upon
you, and from the depths I cry to
you. This evening I will confess
my sins to your minister, but my
faith will not suffer me to wait. Pardon
me, Lord, and heal me. And
you, O Mother of Mercy! come to
the help of your unhappy child!"</p>

<p>And, feeling strengthened by my
prayer, I opened the box. It contained
a bottle of pure water. I uncorked
it, poured some of the water
into a glass, and took a napkin from
the drawer.</p>

<p>These commonplace preparations,
which I made with care, were accompanied
by a secret solemnity, the
memory of which still haunts me.
In that room I was not alone. God
was there certainly; and the Blessed
Virgin, whom I had invoked, was also
there.</p>

<p>Ardent faith inflamed my soul.
When all was ready, I knelt down
again. "O Blessed Virgin Mary!"
I cried in a loud voice, "heal my
physical and spiritual blindness." Saying
these words, with a heart full of
confidence, I bathed successively
both eyes and my forehead with the
napkin which I had dipped in the
water. This did not occupy more
than half a minute.</p>

<p>Judge of my astonishment&mdash;I had
almost said my terror! Scarcely had
I touched my eyes and forehead
with the miraculous water than I
felt myself cured, at once, without
transition, with a suddenness which I
can compare only to lightning.</p>

<p>Strange contradiction of human
nature! A moment before I had
trusted my faith, which promised me
a cure; now, I could not believe my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835">[835]</a></span>
senses, which assured me that the
cure had been worked.</p>

<p>No! I did not believe my senses.
In spite of the startling effect which
had been wrought upon me, I committed
the fault of which Moses was
guilty, and struck the rock twice. I
continued to bathe my eyes and
forehead, not daring to open them,
not daring to verify my cure. At
the end of ten minutes, however, the
strength which I felt in my eyes, and
the absence of all heaviness, left no
chance for doubt. "I am cured!"</p>

<p>So saying, I snatched up a book.
"No," said I, "that is not the book
for me to be reading at this moment."
Then I took from the mantelpiece
the <cite>Account of the Apparitions at
Lourdes</cite>. I read a hundred and four
pages without stopping or feeling
the least fatigue. Twenty minutes
before, I could not have read three
lines. Indeed, if I stopped at the
hundred-and-fourth page, it was only
because it was thirty-five minutes
past five o'clock, and at this hour in
October it is almost dark in Paris.
When I laid aside my book, the gas
was being lighted in the shops of
the street in which I lived.</p>

<p>That evening, I made my confession
to the Abbé Ferrand, and acquainted
him with the great gift
which I had received from the Blessed
Virgin. Although in no degree
prepared, he wished me to go to
communion the next day, to thank
God for such an extraordinary favor,
and to strengthen the good resolutions
which it had caused to spring
up in my soul.</p>

<p>M. and Mme. de &mdash;&mdash; were, as
one may imagine, greatly moved by
this event, in which Providence had
assigned them so direct a part.
What did they think of it? What
reflections were suggested to their
minds? What took place in the
depth of their hearts? That secret
belongs only to them and to God.
What little I have been able to make
out, I am not at liberty to publish.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, I know my
friend's nature. I left him to his
own thoughts, without urging him to
the conclusion. I knew, and still
know, that God has his own time
and his own ways. His action was
so manifest throughout the whole
affair that I did not wish to interfere,
although my friends have never been
ignorant of my desire to see them
enter the only church which contains
God in his fulness.</p>

<p>I regret not being able to consider
these two beings&mdash;so dear to me&mdash;as
receiving from the reaction of the
miracle of which I had been the object
the first shocks which truth gives
to those whom it seeks to conquer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Seven years have now passed since
my miraculous cure. My sight is
excellent. Neither reading nor hard
work, even when kept up late at
night, wearies my eyes. God grant
me never to use them save in the
cause of right.</p>

<h2>AMERICA'S OBLIGATIONS TO FRANCE.</h2>


<p>The woes and crimes of unhappy
France have attracted the mixed regards
of the world; it has become
an agreeable and timely diversion to
look away from the distressing picture,
to find whatever there is of
compensation in the glories and virtues
of her past; and the occasion is
thus created to review our own obligations
as a nation to this now
stricken and humbled European
power, and to determine how much
we are indebted to France for our
own independence and liberty. Another
interest is added to the occasion
in the fact that this part of
our history has been but scantily told,
and that, as the writer is persuaded,
our national vanity, notoriously accumulated
as it is about everything
belonging to the Revolutionary period,
has hitherto prevented a fair
and full confession of the obligations
referred to&mdash;has diminished the story,
if not actually misrepresented it. But
it is a mistaken vanity, the very opposite
of a manly pride. A sentiment
of the illustrious Lafayette fits in here.
A citizen of both France and America,
he stood between the two, and spoke
happily for each, saying: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comme
un Français, dont le cœur brûle de
patriotisme, je me réjouis du rôle que
la France a joué, et de l'alliance
qu'elle a fait. Comme Americain, je
reconnais l'obligation, et je crois qu'en
cela consiste la vraie dignité.</span>"</p>

<p>The severe truth of history and the
constraints of true dignity alike compel
the statement, that but for the
French interposition the cause of the
American colonists was likely to be
lost; at least, that our independence
would not have been obtained when
it was, and as completely as it was,
but for the succors of France. And
this proposition, the writer thinks,
may be made out from a summary
view of the history of the period, yet
calling attention to some facts that
do not appear hitherto to have been
calculated.</p>

<p>Accustomed as we are, in looking
back upon the history of our Revolutionary
struggle, to dwell upon its
last signal triumphs, and naturally
disposed to measure the preceding
events by the conclusion, it is difficult
for us of this day to realize how
narrowly it avoided defeat, and in
what extremity it at one time hesitated.
In the winter of 1780, and at a
time when the aid of France was
most urgently implored, the American
cause was almost at its last gasp.
Many of its leaders had secretly despaired
of it, and found it difficult to
impose upon the public the countenance
of hope. In a private letter,
Mr. Madison wrote: "How a total
dissolution of the army can be prevented
in the course of the winter"
[1780-1781] "is, for any resources
now in prospect, utterly inexplicable."
There was no money to pay the
troops; and the fact was that the
war was no longer kept up but by
ill-digested and dilatory expedients.
Meanwhile, the fate of arms accumulated
against the colonists, and the
fortunes of the field were as bad as
the embarrassments of the interior
administration. The more Southern
States appeared to be already lost by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_837" id="Page_837">[837]</a></span>
the irruptions of the enemy upon an
indefensible coast; and the whole
army of General Greene was soon to
be in full retreat before Lord Cornwallis
through the State of North
Carolina.</p>

<p>The two great wants of the colonists,
and which had become vital,
were <i>money</i> and a <i>fleet</i>. "The sinews
of war" were nearly spent. The
paper money of Congress was fast
becoming worthless; the resource to
specific requisitions was a mere indirection
as long as the states supplied
them by paper emissions of their own;
and of this resource it was prophesied
in Congress that "what was intended
for our relief will only hasten our
destruction."</p>

<p>The want of a counterpoise to the
naval power of England was the
main point of the military situation.
Here was a fatal weakness; and
events had progressed far enough to
show that the hope of a decisive field
anywhere in the colonies depended
upon their maintaining a naval superiority
in the American seas. In
weighing the chances of the war, the
configuration of the American territory
is to be studied; and how vulnerable
it was from the water had
already been proved by the events
of the war. At the time of the Revolution,
the breadth of the American
settlements from the Penobscot to the
Altamaha did not average more than
a hundred miles from the sea-line.
This jagged strip of territory, traversed
by estuaries and navigable streams,
was so accessible to the enemy's vessels,
that his navy might be considered
as constantly equivalent to a second
army operating on the flank of that
engaged on shore. Wherever Washington
might move, this apparition
would cling to him&mdash;his flank constantly
threatened, and every movement
he made on land compelled to
calculate the possibility of a counter-movement
by the English fleet that
hovered on the coast, and might
develop an attack with greater expedition
than he could change his
front to meet it. It was the thorn in
his side. When the baffled American
commander spoke of retiring into the
mountains of Virginia for a last desperate
stand, it was not a rhetorical
flourish, as it has generally been accounted,
but a true military appreciation
of the situation&mdash;the necessity
of a barrier against the naval power
of the enemy. If that barrier could
be made on the water by the interposition
of a fleet, then he would be
(what he had not hitherto been) free
to operate on the land, and make
there a field that might be decisive.
But the element of any such strategic
combination was naval supremacy,
and, until that was obtained, he could
only hope at best for a desultory
warfare, with constant exposure to a
risk that he could neither meet nor
avoid.</p>

<p>Now, the two vital wants of America&mdash;a
foreign loan and a naval armament&mdash;were
those which were precisely
supplied by France. A foreign
loan of specie, to the amount of twenty-five
millions of livres, was asked
of his Most Christian Majesty; and
Franklin, reinforced by Col. Laurens,
was instructed to impress the French
king and his ministers with the especial
need of a demonstration against
the naval power of England. The
succors were granted, and were beyond
the expectations of the colonists.
In July, 1780, the first French expedition,
under the command of the
Count Rochambeau, landed at Newport.
And from that moment a new
hope commenced for America, and a
new inspiration was to bring to sudden
buoyancy a sinking cause. The
French force, however, was held
inoperative for some time for the
want of a sufficient navy to co-operate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_838" id="Page_838">[838]</a></span>
and to this end the supplications
of Congress to the French
monarch had been redoubled. The
expedition of Rochambeau consisted
of five thousand men. It was to be
reinforced by a fleet from the West
Indies; but the orders had miscarried;
and it was more than a year
later when the second instalment of
French aid was made available, and
the conditions realized which fixed
the last field of the war, and secured
that final victory to which
the French aids, by land and by water,
were each indispensable. To
this second aid reference will be
made in its order.</p>

<p>Usually, a foreign contingent is not
the best of the military material which
a country may afford. The hireling
and the adventurer enter largely into
its composition, and its standard of
service is low and suspicious. But
this common imputation could not be
cast on the expeditionary corps under
Rochambeau. It was of the flower
of the French army, and nobility did
not disdain the service of the infant
Republic. The illustrious Lafayette
stood by himself, being a volunteer,
and independent of the action of the
royal forces. "The Marquis," as
Washington never failed to punctiliously
call him, won all hearts in
America; and, though accused by
Thomas Jefferson, who, however, was
habitually envious, of having "a canine
thirst for popularity," there is
good reason to believe that he was
actuated by a solid attachment to
liberty and inspired by generous
motives. Anyhow, he was destined,
as we shall see, to perform one of the
most brilliant and critical services of
the Revolution. The Count Rochambeau
was never popular in America;
his manners were haughty, and he had
a military exclusiveness; but he was
an excellent soldier, and at one time
he gave a striking example of his
deference to republican principles in
submitting to be arrested, in a group
of his officers, at the hands of a petty
county constable, on the complaint
of a New England farmer for some
acts of petty "trespass" on his fields!
In his command, landed at Newport,
there were names already illustrious
in France, or destined to become so.
Of such names were the Chevalier
de Chastellux, performing the duties
of major-general in the expeditionary
corps, an encyclopædist and the friend
of Voltaire; Berthier, afterwards risen
from the rank of an under-officer to
be a marshal of France and minister
of war; the Count de Ségur, celebrated
in literary as well as military
life; the Duke de Lauzun, afterwards
a general of the French Republic;
the Count de Dillon, who, a few years
later, met a tragic fate at the hands
of the Revolutionary party in France;
Pichegru, then a private in the ranks
of the artillery; Matthieu Dumas,
subsequently a peer of France; Aubert-Dubayet,
afterwards minister of
war under the French Republic;
the Prince de Broglie, afterwards
field-marshal, and one of the victims
of the Revolutionary tribunal of
1794, etc.</p>

<p>Of the character of the soldiers we
have some pleasant and vivid contemporary
testimony. The idea which
the sturdy American colonist, the
backwoodsman with his Tower musket,
had formed in advance of the
French soldier, was not altogether a
complimentary one. It was generally
a caricature, popular at that day, of a
dapper, ill-contrived individual who
made ridiculous mistakes in the English
language, ate frogs, memorable
in the lampoon of Hogarth as toasting
one of the amphibious at the end
of a rapier, and had but the one virtue
to make amends for his eccentricities&mdash;a
courage that was unquestionable,
though grotesque and physically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839">[839]</a></span>
inefficient. The picture was
dispelled at the sight of Rochambeau's
veterans&mdash;men who equalled
in stature and in strength the best
that England could display, who
were inured to hardship and fatigue
such as were scarcely supported by
the green backwoodsman, and who
marched hundreds of miles with an
order and steadiness that never failed
to be admirable. Mr. Madison, who
saw these troops file through Philadelphia,
after the fatigues of a march
from the banks of the Hudson River,
thus testifies his impressions of the
spectacle: "Nothing can exceed the
appearance of this specimen which
our ally has sent us of his army, whether
we regard the figure of the men
or the exactness of their discipline."</p>

<p>Such was the brilliancy and the
solid worth of the first contributions
of France to her feeble ally. To estimate
the motives and spirit of such
aids, what influences ranged an old
and brilliant monarchy by the side
of an infant Republic branded with
"rebellion," and intertwined flags so
opposite, it will be well to review the
relations of the parties to an alliance
so strange and exceptional.</p>

<p>France had no interests to cultivate
in America, no objects of ambition
to secure in a quarter of the world
from which she had deliberately withdrawn.
Her flag had not appeared
there since the Treaty of Paris in
1756, and her subsequent cession to
Spain of her possessions on the Mississippi
left her, for the present, disembarrassed
of all territorial claims
and interests in America. She had
no reason for any affection for the
English colonists now asserting their
independence; they were the sons
of those who had fought against her;
the traditions of the colonial wars in
America were yet fresh. On the side
of the rebel colonists themselves, there
was a suspicion of France&mdash;at least,
no disposition to expect any generosity
from her in the struggle that
was to ensue. So little was that part
expected which she did eventually
take in the American Revolution,
that Patrick Henry (incredible as the
fact may appear to those who have
read only eulogiums on this person)
actually retreated at the last from the
Declaration of Independence, from
fear of France and her co-operation
to subdue the colonies. In a letter
to John Adams, written five days
after the Virginia Convention had
adopted the famous resolution of the
15th May, 1776, for independence,
he dwells upon the apprehension that
France might be seduced to take
sides against the colonies by an offer
from England to divide the territories
of America between them. It was an
unworthy suspicion; but Mr. Henry,
who had but little originality, and
was a characteristic retailer of popular
impressions, was probably in this
imputation upon France the echo of
a thought common at the time.</p>

<p>No grounds of sympathy were yet
apparent between France and the
struggling colonists; nothing, as far
as the men of 1776 should see, but
recollections of old animosity and
present causes for distrust. Even the
sympathy of religion, which has
proved such a fruitful source of international
friendships and alliances,
where there have been no other points
of coincidence, was wanting; instead
of it, a sharp antagonism was the
fact. Protestant America, many parts
of it yet fresh with the persecution
of Catholics, had no reason to expect
favors from Catholic France. Indeed,
when those favors were given,
there was some discontented and ungrateful
outcry that it was a design
upon the religion of the colonists;
so deeply sown was the distrust of
France. There were those to object
that Congress had attended a Mass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840">[840]</a></span>
and that the municipal authorities of
Boston had, on some occasion, walked
in a Catholic procession. The
traitor, Benedict Arnold, in casting
about for reasons to defend his treason,
could find none more plausible,
or, in his estimation, more likely to
be received, than that the French
alliance was about to betray the religion
of the colonists, and that he,
therefore, had determined to take
refuge in Protestant England! Such
an appeal to popular prejudice was
doubtless extravagant, even more so
than that of Patrick Henry accusing
France; but both show the extent of
estrangement and suspicion which
France had to overcome before she
could convince America of her friendship
and generosity. And, unfortunately,
as we shall presently painfully
see, such suspicion was never entirely
overcome, but was to remain to disfigure
the last page of the history of
the Revolution, and to attach to it a
story of permanent disgrace to America.</p>

<p>When the colonies implored the
aid of France, through an address of
Congress in November, 1780, the
appeal showed an extremity and temper
of the colonists which suggested
that almost any price would be paid
for the necessary succors. How far
the French monarch might have
availed himself of the necessities of
his suppliant ally, had he been selfish
enough to make these the measure
of his demands, is a conjecture almost
illimitable. To purchase the aid of
Spain, the American Congress had
been willing to retract former resolutions,
and to offer the almost priceless
boon of the exclusive navigation of
the Mississippi; and it was only the
fatuity and blindness of that power
that had prevented the fatal concession.
Was the aid of France worth
less? and was the temper of concession
not to be practised upon by herself?</p>

<p>It has been usual to give a very
summary and cold explanation of the
aids which France furnished the
American cause, by pointing out its
effect to cripple her powerful and
hereditary foe, England; thus detracting
from the generosity of the
contribution, and representing it as a
mere move on the diplomatic chess-board
which the French monarch
could not do otherwise than make.
But this detraction does not hold
good. Admitting the full force of
the reasons which it imputes to
France, there is much in her alliance
with America that is yet left unexplained;
and there are circumstances
which make it one of the most peculiar
and unique examples of generosity
recorded in history. It has not
been unusual for powerful nations to
assist the weak on no other ground
of sympathy than having a foe in
common; but it has seldom been the
case that such aid has been rendered
without the powerful ally exacting
terms for her own contribution, and
turning to her own advantage the
necessities she has been called upon
to aid. England herself had afforded
a precedent for the price of such
concessions. She had asked of the
United Provinces, for the price of her
support against Spain, that all her
expenses should be repaid, and that
the towns and fortresses of Holland
should be held by her as pledges for
the conditions of the alliance. France
would have been sustained by historical
example, and by moral right,
in exacting very important concessions
for her aid of the American
cause in circumstances in which that
aid was deemed vital for the success
of a struggle that already bordered
on despair. She asked nothing. She
gave an army and a fleet, and bore
all the expenses of both armaments.
She advanced money and replenished
the almost empty treasury of her ally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841">[841]</a></span>
And she yet enlarged the generosity
of her alliance by devoting her arms,
not only to a common operation, but
pledging at the outset the indispensable
conclusion of her exertions in
the independence of America and the
territorial integrity of the States. In
the Treaty of 1778, "the direct and
essential end" of the alliance was
declared to be "the liberty, sovereignty,
and independence, absolute and
unlimited, of the United States."</p>

<p>The arms of France were thus
given directly to a cause of republican
liberty rather than merely involved
in a diplomatic complication.
What reasons could have induced
this apparent excess of generosity,
this singular spectacle of the ancient
monarchy of the Franks taking sides
with the infant republic of the Anglo-Saxon
colonists of America?</p>

<p>The explanation is that the French
aid was a contribution of the <i>people</i> of
France rather than that of its crown.
It sprung out of the popular heart
rather than the grace of a kind and
munificent monarch; and it has this
circumstance of a tender and imperishable
souvenir to the American
people. It was a free love-offering,
the first dedication of their cause in
the sympathies of the world. That
republican sentiment which a few
years later in France sprang into
such fierce life, was already deeply
harbored in the hearts of her people;
and the movement of the American
colonists gave it an opportunity of
comparatively safe expression; while
all the romance of such a sentiment
found abundant material in the circumstances
of the struggle, the distance
of the theatre, its scenery bordered
by savage life, the novelty of
a people whose history was entirely
unique, and whose simplicity of manners
suggested comparisons with classical
antiquity. The enthusiasm of
the French mind seized every attractive
circumstance of the occasion.
It was entitled "the crusade of the
eighteenth century." Again, it was
adorned with recollections more antique,
and it was said that "the Republic
of Plato" had at last found
realization in the midst of a people
whose exclusive situation had been a
school for virtues hitherto unknown,
and was to afford an experiment that
had until then lingered in the speculations
of philosophy and the dreams
of poetry. The simplicity of American
manners was taken as a charming
contrast to the court splendors of
Paris and Versailles. It was not
only Franklin's cotton stockings, but
every peculiarity of the American
citizen became a picturesque study
and the symbol of a new political
life. The memoirs of the Count de
Ségur are among the contemporary
testimonies of the rage in the French
capital for everything American; and
we are specially told of "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cet air antique
qui semblant transporter tout-a-coup
dans nos murs, au milieu de
la civilisation amollie et servile au
dix-huitième siècle, quelques sages
contemporans de Platon, on des republicains
du temps de Caton et de
Fabius</span>!"</p>

<p>Of the operations of the allied
arms, our space only affords such a
sketch as may give some general
idea of the extent and value of the
French aid. Washington had at first
proposed, on the arrival of Rochambeau,
to attempt the repossession of
New York City, and to crush there
the main body of the British army.
But the failure to arrive of the naval
forces expected from Brest and the
West Indies disconcerted the plan;
and events were preparing another
theatre for the final catastrophe.
The British post and army in Virginia
became the objective point of
the allied arms. The long-expected
French fleet was at last assured; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842">[842]</a></span>
was to make its appearance in the
Chesapeake; and Washington prepared
to move his army from the
banks of the Hudson to the distant
scene of co-operation. From a temporary
observatory on the heights
near Newburg, the anxious commander
watched his army crossing
the blue stream; and as he mounted
his horse, to put himself at the head
of a march that was to toil over many
hundreds of miles to find a last and
effulgent field, far away in Virginia,
he wrung the hand of a French officer
who stood in the group around him,
as expressing the new hope that had
dawned in his face, and repledging
the alliance that was to win its realization.
And now ensued a combination
of circumstances, in each one of
which the French arms determined
a crisis, and displayed a dramatic
spectacle.</p>

<p>Lafayette, "the boy" in Cornwallis's
estimation, "the tutelary genius
of American independence," as he
has been designated by a Virginian
historian and statesman (William C.
Rives), was sent forward to Virginia,
to hold in check there the haughty
enemy. Washington had given to
this young Frenchman supreme command
of the operations in Virginia.
He justified a trust which the pride
of the state might possibly resent, in
his own estimate of the qualities of
the noble foreigner. In a private
letter to a Congressman of Virginia
(Jones) he wrote: "The Marquis
possesses uncommon military talents;
is of a quick and sound judgment;
persevering and enterprising without
rashness; and, besides these, he is of
a very conciliating temper, and perfectly
sober&mdash;which are qualities that
rarely combine in the same person.
And were I to add that some men
will gain as much experience in the
course of three or four years as some
others will in ten or a dozen, you
cannot deny the fact, and attack me
upon that ground." Lafayette was
elevated over the heads of both General
Wayne and the Baron de Steuben.</p>

<p>When the Frenchman came to the
defence of Virginia, she was well-nigh
conquered. She was open in
every direction to the enterprise of
the invader. Her public men were
recreant, and under the suspicion of
cowardice. One of her most faithful
censors has recorded the delinquency
of the times. In a letter dated the
6th November, 1780, Judge Pendleton
wrote: "We had no House of
Delegates on Saturday last, which,
with our empty treasury, are circumstances
unfavorable at this juncture.
Mr. Henry has resigned his seat in
Congress; and I hear Mr. Jones
intends it. It is also said the governor
intends to resign. It is a little
cowardly to quit our posts in a bustling
time." The city of Richmond,
for which was to be reserved in history
stains beyond any other American
city, was ready to submit tamely
to another occupation. The fact is,
painful as the confession may be to
the Virginian of to-day&mdash;offending the
pride of a state that has almost invidiously
claimed her part in the Revolution&mdash;Virginia
had grown reluctant
in the war, and disposed to have
recourse to unworthy expedients.
She had been prominent in Congress
to recommend the surrender of the
navigation of the Mississippi in order
to buy the alliance of Spain. She
had twice proposed a dictatorship;
and now, when Cornwallis was advancing,
and Mr. Jefferson was resigning
the governorship, and suspicion,
as we have seen, had fallen on other
leaders in the "bustling times," no
less a person than Richard Henry
Lee, then in retirement at Westmoreland,
was willing to surrender the
liberties of Virginia to a dictator
as the only resource of safety! Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843">[843]</a></span>
the state had nothing between her
and the public enemy than the twelve
hundred bayonets of Lafayette. The
address and skill of the young Frenchman
saved the Old Dominion from
a subjection that would, otherwise,
have been complete, as far as the
swift arms of Cornwallis could have
overrun the state.</p>

<p>Lafayette had retired to the Rapidan
as the imposing and triumphant
army of Cornwallis advanced on
Richmond. Here, joined by the
Pennsylvania troops under General
Wayne and a body of riflemen from
the western part of Virginia, he was
able to retrace his steps, and to press
Cornwallis's retreat towards the Chesapeake.
Extricating himself from an
unequal engagement at Jamestown,
he moved up the river, and reposed
at Malvern Hill&mdash;since celebrated as
a refuge in a greater contest of arms.
Subsequently, at Williamsburg, he
was joined by the allied forces under
Washington and Rochambeau&mdash;and
then commenced the combination
that was to compass Cornwallis, and
to constitute the last splendid scene
of the war.</p>

<p>It was a broad scene. On the 30th
of August, 1781, twenty-eight line-of-battle
ships, bearing the flag of
France, rode on the beautiful expanse
of the Chesapeake. They had come
from the West Indies. Eight other
ships suddenly appeared from the
opposite point of the compass: the
French squadron from Rhode Island,
which had entered the Chesapeake,
in spite of the efforts of the English
admirals to intercept it. The <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ville
de Paris</i>, the flag-ship of the French
admiral, had held in council the great
actors of the drama&mdash;Washington,
Rochambeau, and the Count de
Grasse; and it only remained to draw
the lines, by sea and land, around
the despairing enemy. The splendid
fleet of France was the barrier between
Cornwallis and the succors
that Sir Henry Clinton had promised
from New York. It was the element
of victory&mdash;the apparition of a new
hope risen from the seas. On the
other wing of the scene floated the
flags of Washington and Rochambeau.
On the land were the splendid
armies of France side by side
with the militia of the young republic,
and almost as numerous as the soldiers,
a vast concourse of country
people, watching the sublime wonders
of a bombardment that laced the
night skies, and enchanted by the
music of the French timbrel, an instrument
then unknown in America.
Three French commands, those of
the Count Rochambeau, the Marquis
de Lafayette, and the Marquis de
Saint-Simon, stood on the field of
Yorktown.</p>

<p>In this circle, made possible only
by the links of the French aid, went
down the flag of Cornwallis and the
hopes of England. It was a memorable
scene, and one which brought
into strong relief the assistance of our
ally. In a letter to General Washington
from Mr. Jefferson, who had
just retired from the gubernatorial
chair of Virginia, the distinguished
patriot, after offering his congratulations,
justly wrote: "If in the minds
of any, the motives of gratitude to
our good allies were not sufficiently
apparent, the part they have borne
in this action must amply evince
them." At the height of its emotions
of joy and gratitude, Congress promised
a monument for the scene. It
was resolved that it would "cause to
be erected at York, in Virginia, a
marble column, adorned with emblems
of the alliance between the
United States and his Most Christian
Majesty, and inscribed with a succinct
narrative." The pledge to this
day remains unfulfilled; and no monument
testifies our early and imperishable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844">[844]</a></span>
obligations to France, except
such as may yet exist in the hearts
of our people.</p>

<p>Here, with the illumination of Yorktown,
we would willingly conclude
the history of the Franco-American
alliance. But there is a sequel not
to be omitted&mdash;a painful story that
belongs yet to the justice of history.</p>

<p>In the negotiations for peace that
followed Yorktown, the American
Congress, new and timorous in diplomacy,
betook itself to a refuge, the
shallowness of which is especially
conspicuous in diplomacy&mdash;that of
supposing wisdom in a multitude of
counsellors. It constituted no less
than five commissioners to treat at
Paris. The selections were ill; and
in some instances the worst that
could have been made. Of the five,
Mr. Jefferson did not attend. Mr.
Adams was personally distasteful to
the French government. How far
Mr. Henry Laurens might be suspected
of undue deference to England
might have been judged from his
famous Tower letter, the cringing
humiliations of which had opened
the doors of his prison; and it is said
that when this letter was divulged to
Congress it would have recalled his
commission, had there not been
doubts of the authenticity of the document,
so extraordinary was its tone.
But it is justice to add that the subsequent
conduct of Mr. Laurens repelled
the charge of partiality for
England; however, the French Government
may have had reason to be
displeased at his antecedents. Mr.
Jay was of a suspicious temper, an
intrigant rather than a diplomatist;
illustrating precisely that lowest notion
of diplomacy, that it is essentially a
game of deceptions&mdash;a part that can
be performed only with a false face.
Happily, the world has outlived this
degrading idea of a really august office,
and has come to question why
deception should be considered more
necessary in diplomacy than in any
other branch of public service. Indeed,
there is room in diplomacy for
the exercise of the highest abilities,
an arena for the busiest and most
exacting competitions of intellectual
skill, without calling into requisition
the weapons of chicanery and fraud.
There is no political service that more
strongly than the office of the diplomatist
tests that sum of powers which
the world calls <i>character</i>: the clear,
strong purpose, with its quick and
happy selection of opportunities, the
instinct, the tact, and the decisiveness
which hold the secret of what is
<i>greatness</i> in history, rather than any
amount of learned accomplishments
or any training of the intellectual
closet. The diplomatist must be
quick, yet strong and unremitting; he
must have unbounded confidence in
himself, without the weakness of
vanity; he must be patient, yet not
dilatory; thoroughly imbued with
the true spirit of the French proverb,
that "he who learns to wait is master
of his fortune." He must have
the faculty of putting things in the
strongest possible light&mdash;that best
and rarest of rhetorical talents, the
power of <i>statement</i>. He must have
a nice sense of opportunities; the
delicate touch with the iron will; he
must practise what Byron numbered
among the cardinal virtues, "tact";
of all men he must wear that excellent
motto, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">suaviter in modo, fortiter
in re</i>. Here, surely, is a theatre for
many virtues and abilities, without
calling to aid the mask and sinister
weapons of professional deceit. The
greatest diplomatist of modern times,
the unequalled Bismarck, is said to
be remarkable for the bluntness and
directness that have overcome by the
very surprises of openness the chicanery
of his opponents. The robustness
of his dealings with the finesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845">[845]</a></span>
of the old traditional school of European
diplomacy reminds one of the
duel in "Peter Simple." A sturdy
Englishman engages a master of fence,
and while the latter practises the
most scientific attitude and has his
rapier poised according to the figures
of the science, he is infinitely surprised
to have it seized in mid-air by
the naked hand of his antagonist,
and himself run through the body.
Not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum artum</i>, but a most efficient
way of concluding the combat.
Of the open and best school of diplomacy,
Franklin at the French court
was a fair representative, the very
opposite of Jay. The philosopher
of Pennsylvania has never been justly
measured as a diplomatist; he had
been successful beyond all other
American envoys; he was now the
Bismarck of the diplomatic collection
at Paris, although he unhappily gave
way to the leadership of Jay.</p>

<p>In the negotiations for peace that
ensued, Mr. Jay, leading more or
less willingly the other commissioners,
was soon over head and ears in
an intrigue with the English ministry;
acting on that lowest supposition of
tyroism in diplomacy&mdash;that the other
party must necessarily design a fraud,
and that a counter-fraud must be prepared
to meet it. Congress had instructed
that there should be made
"the most candid and confidential
communications upon all subjects to
the ministers of our generous ally,
the King of France"; and it took
occasion to give a remarkable expression
of gratitude to France, its
resolutions declaring "how much we
rely on his majesty's influence for
effectual support in everything that
may be necessary to the present security
or future prosperity of the
United States of America." Mr.
Jay, who had taken the lead in the
negotiations, willingly followed by
Adams, "dragging in Franklin," and
resisted to some extent by Laurens
proceeded deliberately to violate
these instructions. He had conceived
the suspicion that France
was secretly hostile to an early acknowledgment
of the independence
of America, and wished to postpone
it until she had extorted objects of
her own from the dependence of
her ally. It is now known that
this suspicion was wholly imaginary.
But Mr. Jay and his colleagues acted
upon it, and were twisted around
the fingers of the English ministry
to the extent of treating with them,
without giving the French government
knowledge of the steps and
progress of the negotiation, thus
contributing to the adroit purpose
of England to sow distrust in the alliance
that had humbled her. While
the American commissioners were
professing to the French minister
that negotiations were yet at a distance,
they had actually signed the
provisional articles of a treaty of
peace with the crown of Great Britain.
Worse than this, they had
agreed to a <i>secret</i> article, which stipulated
a more favorable northern
boundary for Florida, in the event
of its conquest by the arms of Great
Britain, than if it should remain in
the possession of Spain at the termination
of the war. Spain was at
that time an ally of France; and so
it may be imagined how the latter
would be embarrassed by this secret
article, and how England might meditate
in it an advantage in disturbing
the understanding of France and
America.</p>

<p>Mr. Jay, unconscious that he had
been made a catspaw of British diplomacy,
felicitated himself that he
had made an excellent bargain and
done an acute thing; possessed as
he was with that fatuity of all deceivers,
that omits to calculate the
time when the deception must necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846">[846]</a></span>
become known. When the
game that had been played upon its
ally became known to Congress, it
plunged that body into the most
painful embarrassment. Mr. Madison,
in his diary of the proceedings
of Congress, thus records its impressions:
"The separate and secret
manner in which our ministers had
proceeded with respect to France,
and the confidential manner with
respect to the British ministers, affected
different members of Congress
differently. Many of the most
judicious members thought they had
all been in some measure ensnared
by the dexterity of the British minister,
and particularly disapproved of
the conduct of Mr. Jay in submitting
to the enemy his jealousy of the
French, without even the knowledge
of Dr. Franklin, and of the unguarded
manner in which he, Mr. Adams,
and Dr. Franklin had given, in writing,
sentiments unfriendly to our ally,
and serving as weapons for the insidious
policy of the enemy. The
separate article was most offensive,
being considered as obtained by
Great Britain, not for the sake of
the territory ceded to her, but as a
means of disuniting the United States
and France, as inconsistent with the
spirit of the alliance, and as a dishonorable
departure from the candor,
rectitude, and plain dealing professed
by Congress."</p>

<p>Congress did not extricate itself
from the dilemma; it could not do
it. Suppression of what had been
done could not be continued; still
less was it possible to make explanations
to France; the only thing to
do was to say nothing, and to let
the painful exposure work itself out.
The King of France had acted with
an openness and an attention to his
allies, the contrasts of which made
the exposure one of great bitterness
and shame. The Count de Vergennes
had assured the American commissioners:
"The king has been resolved
that all his allies should be
satisfied, being determined to continue
the war, whatever advantages
may be offered to him, if England
is disposed to wrong any of them."
Now, when the articles were brought
into council to be signed, the French
monarch could not be other than
surprised and indignant. He put
royal restraint upon his speech; but
he could not forbear saying, with a
bluntness that must have bruised
American pride, and staggered the
self-felicitations of Mr. Jay, that "he
did not think he had such allies to
deal with."</p>

<p>The court of France sustained the
insult with dignity, and yet with evidence
of a deep sense of wrong.
When inquiry was made whether expostulations
would be made to the
American Congress, the reply of M.
Marbois was heroic: "A great nation,"
he answered, "does not complain;
but it feels and remembers."</p>

<h2>THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IN GENEVA.</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In order to understand the events
which have lately taken place in
Geneva, and those that are preparing
there, it is necessary to cast a general
glance over the past and present
state of the Catholic religion in that
little commonwealth.</p>

<p>Most people know what Geneva
was prior to the French Revolution:
an independent state, separate from
the Swiss Cantons, reduced by Calvinism
to an aristocratic theocracy,
and shorn of those ancient democratic
franchises which it had enjoyed
before breaking away from Rome.
The dominant principle in its customs
and legislation was fear and
hatred of the proscribed worship.
A minute and jealous care was taken
to repress the expansion of Catholicism&mdash;one
exhibition of which was
seen in the strict closing of the city
gates on the grand festivals of the
church, and the fine of ten crowns
imposed on those who held intercourse
with the Bishop of Annecy
on the occasion of his pastoral visits.
Under these circumstances, only a
small number of Catholics clung
with heroic constancy to the ancient
faith, and secretly practised their religious
duties in the recesses of their
houses. There were in 1759 but
two hundred and twenty-seven Catholics
in Geneva&mdash;and in this number
even Voltaire and his hangers-on
were included.</p>

<p>It was the French Revolution that
forced open the gates, up to that
period so carefully closed, of this
Protestant Rome. Geneva became
under the Empire a French department,
and the Catholic religion
in the persons of the imperial functionaries
was officially recognized.
Permission to erect a church was
granted; but this first move toward
a less hostile attitude was not taken
without the bitterest opposition from
the old Protestant party. In the remodelling
of Europe, after Napoleon's
downfall, it was found desirable to
provide against the absorption of
Geneva by uniting it to the Swiss
Confederation; but in order to overcome
the difficulties of geographical
position, and make such an acquisition
of territory acceptable to Berne,
it became necessary to join to Geneva
certain strips of land from the
Catholic districts of Gex and Savoy.
The Genevans, who looked with
dread upon this annexation, strove
to assure in any case their own supremacy,
but the Catholics found
defenders in diplomatic circles, and
their cause was protected by the several
treaties of Paris, Vienna, and
Turin (1814-1816). In virtue of
these, all civil and political rights
were guaranteed to the new citizens,
the Catholic religion was recognized,
its exercise in Geneva permitted, religious
freedom solemnly pledged to
the annexed populations, and the
expenses of their public worship assumed
by the state.</p>

<p>At this period the Catholics were
not over a third of the whole canton;
but they rapidly increased, less,
indeed, through conversions than by
immigration. In 1834, there were
25,000 Protestants and 18,000 Catholics.
What was the attitude of
the Genevan government then? Power
was still in the hands of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848">[848]</a></span>
Protestant aristocracy&mdash;the strongest
and only organized party, and a
singular admixture of good qualities
and defects. The patrician of Geneva
was, indeed, a strange and now
fast-disappearing type. Living in
his old town surrounded by ramparts,
and in his old society even
more stringently closed, clad in sombre
colors, speaking little and laughing
less, vain, stiff in his manners,
with a stony cast of countenance,
he was devoid of generous sympathy
and largeness of heart, without, however,
being altogether incapable of a
certain pecuniary liberality; benign
to his clients, implacable to rivals,
marking out in everything a conventional
line, and merciless to the one
who should cross it; a man of letters,
but an enemy to literary liberty, the
friend of order, respecting traditions,
an ardent patriot, but of a narrow
and exclusive patriotism, he was attached
more to his caste and party
than to his country. Often sincerely
pious, this Genevan gentleman of
the old school was sometimes a hypocrite
and Pharisee; a formalist
himself, he was quick to cast the first
stone at the transgressors of the law.
But what was strongest in this class
of men was the Protestant sentiment
in its most odious and intolerant
shape. Having seen with displeasure
the annexation of the Catholic districts,
and agreed very unwillingly to
the religious liberty insured by treaty,
this party found it hard to extinguish
its traditional spirit of bigotry. Every
movement of vitality on the part
of Catholics excited distrust, and
looked like a revolt; and proceeding
to open acts, it struck successively at
the liberty of instruction, the freedom
of the pulpit, and the right of endowment.
The attempt to enforce civil
marriage failed only when Sardinia
threatened to intervene. Catholics
were eyed with disfavor, and of the
thousand servants of the government,
only fifty-nine belonged to their
creed. Finally, if Protestants were
obliged to endure the official existence
of the Roman Church, it seemed
to them quite proper to try and
make it a state affair. They obtained
from the Pope in 1819 the transfer
of jurisdiction over Geneva from
the Archbishop of Chambéry to the
Bishop of Lausanne&mdash;their secret
object being to subject the Catholic
clergy to the direct influence of government,
through the dependence on
the state to which the bishops of
Switzerland had long been accustomed,
and in particular by using the
conciliatory and somewhat weak character
of Monseigneur de Lausanne.</p>

<p>In fact, an agreement was drawn
up with the bishop, by which the
civil power was permitted to interfere
in the nomination of pastors, exact
from them an oath, publish
and circulate episcopal charges. Soon
after, a law made the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">placet</i> obligatory
for all documents emanating from
the diocesan or papal authorities. A
few official honors and some pecuniary
advantages were the only compensation
made to Catholics for the
prejudice done their liberty. These,
however, struggled perseveringly
against all exertions to enthrall them,
and continued in spite of every difficulty
to increase and gain strength.
This success they owed chiefly to their
courageous pastor, the Abbé Vuarin,
"an admirable man for a conflict,"
as his friend Lamennais used to say
of him: one whose indefatigable industry,
fearlessness, and devotion to
duty made every sacrifice light. He
travelled Europe in the interests of
his flock, and Turin, Berne, Paris,
Munich, Rome, heard him defend
their cause. He had friends in all
places, and corresponded with popes,
kings, and the great men of his day;
and, during the continual hostilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_849" id="Page_849">[849]</a></span>
which he carried on against Protestants,
wrote some severe things,
for the most part anonymously, but
other times under his own name,
wherein the only subject of regret
is too great fieriness and irony. He
used to watch the ballot-boxes while
reciting his breviary, which drew from
M. de Maistre the remark, "When I
see his way of working, it recalls the
success of the apostles." M. Vuarin
had said, "A priest who is named
pastor at Geneva should go,
should remain, and should end
there"; and, true to his own word, he
died there, parish priest, in 1843,
having been appointed under the Empire.
Before his time, it was only
now and then that a cassock ventured
to appear in Geneva: at his funeral,
two bishops, two hundred priests,
and thousands of Catholic laymen
defiled through the streets of the old
Protestant city.</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that Catholic
progress only irritated the intolerant
spirit of opposition, and at
the centennial jubilee of the Reformation,
in 1835, the inflamed passions
of the multitude broke out in
insults and deeds of violence against
the faith of the minority. The Protestant
Union, a sort of secret society,
was formed to sustain and encourage
exclusivism and anti-Catholic
feelings; and when a collective address,
signed by the clergy of Geneva,
denounced the movement to the bishop,
the council of state, in retaliation,
refused to admit the nomination
of any priest who should not have
expressed regret for appending his
name to the paper. At M. Vuarin's
death, Geneva was for several years
deprived of the ministrations of his
successor, M. Marilley, who had
been arrested by the public officers
and conducted to the frontier. Such,
in 1846, was the position of the
church: misunderstood in her spirit,
the full measure of her rights withheld,
strong only in the energy of
her defenders. Then a political
change took place, which considerably
modified the situation.</p>

<p>In the plain on the other side of
the Rhone, facing the steep hill whereon
are the dwellings of the Genevan
aristocracy, along which are
drawn out the narrow streets of the
old town, and on the summit of which
rise the city hall and St. Peter's
church&mdash;that Acropolis of Calvinism&mdash;extends
the democratic and laboring
suburb of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saint Gervais</i>. Here
for several years a work had been
going on whose gravity the ruling
class of Geneva did not comprehend.
A radical and demagogical party, intimately
connected with the revolutionists
of other countries, was being
organized. Its newspapers, pamphlets,
and the affair of "Young Italy"
in 1836 revealed its boldness and
vigorous action. On the occasion
of the Sonderbund disturbances in
1846, the radicals got excited, the
Faubourg St. Gervais rose in tumult,
and after a sanguinary struggle the
conservatives were put down, the
old town was occupied by the victorious
workmen, and the power of the
state passed into the hands of the
leaders of the insurrection&mdash;M.
Fazy and his friends. The extinction
of the ancient oligarchy was
known to be their object. Catholics
had kept aloof from this conflict, feeling
little sympathy with the revolutionary
passions of the radicals,
whose pretext, moreover, for rising
had been the aid extended by the
Genevan government to their co-religionists
of the Sonderbund. But
when once in power, the new party,
more astute than its predecessor, understood
the importance of the Catholic
element when it came to a
question of votes.</p>

<p>M. Fazy, although ultra in politics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850">[850]</a></span>
had no religious prejudices, and,
neither Catholic nor Protestant, all
he cared for was to bring about the
ruin of the Calvinist aristocracy. In
so much (as the Bishop of Lausanne
observed in 1849), he was acting to
the advantage of Catholics. After
the radicals had destroyed the ramparts
of the old town, Geneva began
rapidly to change appearance: entirely
new quarters were soon laid
out, strangers came in large numbers,
and the Catholic population visibly
increased with the immigration. In
1850, the canton counted 34,212 Protestants
and 29,764 Catholics; ten
years later, the figures stood 42,099
of the latter to 40,069 of the
former.</p>

<p>The radicals had the good sense
also to respect the liberty of Catholics;
they gave them ground to build
another church on, and in the central
part of the new districts, hard
by the railway-station, a Gothic edifice,
which people used to call the
cathedral-citadel&mdash;the temple of liberty&mdash;was
erected. Thus little by
little the two classes were drawn together,
despite so many profound
differences. The conservatives themselves
contributed to this, for the concessions
to Catholics were their chief
point of opposition; and in the next
electoral campaign they took for
rallying-cry, "Fazy sold to the papists."
Thereupon it became a necessity,
if Catholics would keep their
rights, to vote with the radicals; they
did so in 1855, and the conservatives
were utterly defeated. Things remained
in this state until 1860, the
government continuing to respect
Catholic liberty; the bishop also was
allowed to return to Geneva, and
Fazy ably defended him against the
narrow prejudices of a few friends.
When the church of Our Lady was
finished, the consecration sermon was
preached by the eloquent mouth of
the man who to-day exercises over
the faithful of Geneva, although with
different qualities, the influence that
M. Vuarin once had. This was the
Abbé Mermillod. Untrammelled by
attachments either to person or party,
clever, firm, yet pacific, uniting to
the authority of virtue all the charms
of talent and character, his liberal
ideas no one could gainsay, and his
devotion to the church the Holy Father
has on more than one occasion
publicly recognized. Nevertheless,
if the rule of the radicals was in
some respects profitable to Catholics,
it was baneful to them on more than
one account. The sources of moral
and intellectual corruption were multiplied
in the canton; freemasonry
received the same concessions as religion;
the professorships in the academy
were bestowed upon the enemies
of every form of Christianity;
and all the while an active proselytism
was spreading immoral sentiments
and infidelity among the people.
In this state of affairs, the opposition
daily waxed stronger, and
after fifteen years of administration,
the radicals were defeated (1861) by
the conservatives, rejuvenated and
transformed into an independent
party.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The party that now came in was
no longer the same old purely aristocratic
one of former times; it had
allies among the democrats. A popular
society, known as The String,
established in the very centre of the
working Quartier de Saint Gervais,
furnished it with brawny arms and
clubs to repel at the polls the violence
which the radicals had initiated.
From 1861 to 1864, the independents
gained ground rapidly, and the
bloody riots that disturbed Geneva
in the last-named year only served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851">[851]</a></span>
to assure their success. It may be
asked, What did the Catholics do
during this political change? They
could not aspire to rule: they were
forced to choose between the Protestant
haters of their faith and the radical
indifferentists who treated all
religions alike&mdash;one might say with
equal contempt&mdash;but which had at
least the merit of respecting liberty
of conscience. A handful of Catholics,
disgusted with the subversive
doctrines of the radicals, sought alliance
with the independents; but the
mass remained liege to their first protectors.
Some of the leaders, too,
of that party belonged to Catholic
families, and were, nominally, Catholics
themselves; whereas all the chief
men of the independents were Protestants.</p>

<p>At this period, a great event in
the Catholic life of Geneva took
place. Pius IX. in 1864 raised the
Abbé Mermillod to the episcopal
dignity; only by a prudent reserve
he did not immediately confer upon
him the title of bishop of that city,
but of Hebron <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in partibus infidelium</i>.
In order not to encounter too many
obstacles at the outset, the authorities
of the canton were not officially
notified of the fact, which was
brought to their knowledge indirectly.
The independents affected to
ignore the new arrangement, and
consider Mgr. Mermillod as only the
vicar-general of Bishop Marilley.
Whenever he spoke as a prelate, they
showed themselves surprised and angry.
The radicals, on their part, saw
the establishment of an episcopal
see with the same unconcern as they
had witnessed the erection of the
cathedral. And yet a few were provoked;
they were principally leaders
from the Catholic ranks, who foresaw
the blow their influence would
receive from such a quarter. On the
other hand, Mgr. Mermillod's European
reputation flattered the self-love
of the Genevans, thus lessening political
and religious repugnances; while
his amenity, conciliatory spirit, the
irresistible seduction of his ways, his
political prudence, which caused him
to avoid the entanglements of party
strife, helped to surmount many obstacles.</p>

<p>A question of great importance to
Catholics soon came up. In 1815,
when parts of Savoy and the Pays-de-Gex
were annexed, although
the religious liberty of the new-comers
had been diplomatically secured,
Geneva reserved to her own sons,
under the modest designation
"rights of property, burghership,
and district residence," the enjoyment
of considerable wealth coming from
old foundations, and destined particularly
for hospitals and other charitable
institutions. The new-comers
had no share in the distribution of
these funds: hence arose the distinction
in the community of <i>elder</i> and
<i>younger</i> brothers. About the year
1866, a motion was put forward to
abolish this privilege of the ancient
citizens, and to induce the new ones
to renounce the treaty stipulations in
their favor and come under the common
law. The project fell through
at the time, but was finally adopted
in 1868. The Catholics took a liberal
and generous stand. They
might regret the international engagements
to respect their religious liberty;
they could loudly complain that
by a provision of the bill the independents
endowed the Protestant
Church with a part of this appropriation,
consequently securing it
against loss in the event of a separation
between church and state,
whereas nothing was set apart to defray
the expenses of Catholic worship;
nevertheless, the great majority
voted to let it pass. God grant
that they may not have been deceived!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_852" id="Page_852">[852]</a></span>
If they had been organized into
a political party, they could and
they should have had inserted some
similar allowance in their favor. For
all this, the Catholics, while they continued
to make rapid progress, assumed
an attitude of moderation
and straightforward liberality. Mgr.
Mermillod openly declared, "The
Catholics have not the preponderance,
or the means of obtaining it;
they do not think of it, they cannot
have it, they do not desire it.
They have no privileges to petition
for, but all more than ever must love
our native Switzerland, which turns
now her eyes upon us, and must
cling to our institutions and to that
liberty which they secure us." The
bishop's adversaries could not find
fault with him, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue des Deux
Mondes</i> was obliged, however unwillingly
and tardily, to acknowledge his
liberal tone. And yet this attitude
of Catholics and their progress only
excited greater distrust and hatred.
The society of The String raised in its
manifestoes the phantom of ultramontanism,
the press insulted them,
and they were threatened in their
rights of association, of burial, of instruction,
and of preaching. It is
principally at Carouge that they
have had to suffer. This place is
under the influence of certain so-called
Catholic radicals, who in truth
are more anti-Catholic than the Protestants
themselves. When these
people attack the church, the independents
support them; sometimes,
however, the latter have known how
to maintain an at least apparent neutrality.</p>

<p>It is chiefly in view of the eventual
re-establishment of the bishopric
of Geneva that anti-Catholic prejudices
are manifested. The Protestants
understand that <i>Hebron</i> is only
a first step, and they recoil at the
idea of having at Geneva itself a Bishop
of Geneva. Several times already
the question has been discussed
in the council of state, and the
opponents of the church seek in Gallican
and <i>Josephine</i> traditions, in the
text of treaties, everywhere, for reasons
to deny to Catholics the right
of having a bishop. Common sense,
equity, treaties, all is against them,
but prejudice prevails. The Catholics
on their side are determined that
they shall have their own bishop,
and this to-day is the great dispute
between them and the Protestants.
Mgr. Mermillod acts in all these troubles
more like an apostle than a politician.
He is right. He believes
in his mission; and, without being
able exactly to point out the course
which Providence will keep, he is
convinced that the church will prosper
in Geneva. May his hope be
realized! At any rate, the Genevan
Catholics are fortunate to have such
a bishop. To conclude, their present
situation is a critical one. It is
fraught with dangers and yet full of
hope.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Patron Saints.</span> By Eliza Allen Starr.
Baltimore: John Murphy &amp; Co. New
York: The Catholic Publication Society.
1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an uncommonly interesting
and readable book. Lives of
saints, especially of such as those
who form its subject, ought, of
course, always to be interesting to
Catholics, and even to others; but,
unfortunately, the abundance of
facts which are often put in a small
space, and the dry and sometimes
unsystematic way in which they are
presented, make them usually, perhaps,
unattractive to any except
those who wish to make what is
called spiritual reading, and put
them, if not entirely beyond the
reach of children, at least much less
useful to them than they might be
made, and than they have been made
in the present work. The aim of the
author has been to bring out the
lives of the servants of God in their
true light, as something more wonderful
than any fairy tales or fictions,
as, indeed, they are; to satisfy the
natural desire of the young for the
marvellous with what is not only
wonderful but admirable, and to supply
the place of fiction&mdash;to some extent,
at least&mdash;with truth. And in
order that they may answer this end,
they are told in an attractive and
conversational way, with occasional
digressions and episodes, and the
style is such that, instead of searching
about for the most interesting of
the lives to begin with, one begins
at once wherever he may happen to
open, and keeps on till it is more
than time to leave off. For, though
these sketches seem to have been
intended principally for children and
young people, there can be no one
who will not be pleased with them
or who is too far advanced and well
informed to profit by them. There
are twelve illustrations. The book
is well printed and elegantly bound.</p>

<p>Details of the self-denying lives
of those who devote themselves to
works of charity, under the rules of
a religious order, are always interesting
to the earnest Catholic. In
this attractive volume, we have a
touching record of the devoted
lives of the Sisters of the Good
Shepherd, woven with the story of
one who came to them dead in sin,
but was brought to life, faith, and
peace, by the blessing of God on
their unfailing efforts. There is no
charity that calls more urgently in
these times for the countenance and
help of pious souls living in the world
than this twofold task undertaken by
these good sisters&mdash;the raising of fallen
women to lives of purity, and providing
a place of refuge from temptation
for destitute young girls.
All other efforts to reform abandoned
women seem to bring forth
but little fruit, while the nuns of
the "Good Shepherd," both in this
country and abroad, have been instrumental
in rescuing a vast number
from lives of infamy, and bringing
them to true penance. This
volume is interesting and instructive,
and cannot fail to impress the
reader with its truthfulness. May
our dear Lord, through its pages,
excite in many souls asking for
work in his vineyard, the desire to
assist in bringing back these lost
sheep to his fold!</p>

<p>"This compilation is intended,"
says the author, in his preface, "to

But it will also prove useful

being selected in illustration of

difficult to carry out with perfect
success, and the author does not
claim to have always made absolutely

but one would be very foolish
not to duly appreciate what is good

<p>This is a beautiful little book, and

Church on Long Island.</span> By
Patrick Mulrenan, Professor of Rhetoric,
etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. New York:
P. O'Shea. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>Truly this is a world of disappointments.
When this book, handsomely
bound and printed in bold type on
delicately tinted paper, was placed
before us, and upon reading the numerous
titles of honor which the
author, with more frankness than
modesty, had appended to his name,
we hastily came to the conclusion
that the Catholic Church on Long
Island had at last found a worthy
and erudite historian. Alas for the
vanity of human hopes! Ere we
had perused a dozen of its hundred
and thirty pages, we discovered that
the brilliant and costly setting,
which we fondly hoped contained a
literary gem beyond price, enclosed
nothing but a paltry imitation in
paste. Our chagrin was the greater
on account of the importance of
the subject, affording, as it does,
many salient points of interest that
deserve to be perpetuated in something
like good language and in proper
method; but candor compels us
to say that this book seems more
like a scrap-book, made up of slip-shod
newspaper paragraphs unartistically
retouched and strung together.
And then the reckless scattering
of polyglot adjectives, the
continuous recurrence of the same
words and forms of expression, the
forgetfulness of facts within the
knowledge of most of the school
children of Brooklyn, and the inexcusable
ignoring of the simplest rules
of grammar, which characterize this
production, are, we venture to affirm,
unparalleled in the history of modern
book-making. The last chapter,
however, surpasses all the others in
verbosity. In thus coming before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855">[855]</a></span>
the public as the historian of the
Catholics of Long Island, the author
seems to have forgotten that the art
of book-writing can only be learned
by years of patient study, and that
the high-sounding phrases which
would do well enough for a class of
young students are altogether out of
place in the pages of a book intended
to be placed in the libraries of our
most intelligent citizens. Literary
vanity is generally a harmless and
sometimes an amusing weakness,
but, when gratified at the expense of
serious subjects, it deserves neither
encouragement nor the charity of
our silence.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">The Historical Reader.</span> By John J.
Anderson, A.M. 1 vol. 12mo, pp. 544.
New York: Clark &amp; Maynard. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>This work, compiled for the use of
schools, has many merits and some
grave defects. The task of culling
from the best writers choice passages
descriptive of striking historical
incidents is one that requires much
judgment and experience for its proper
performance; while the difficulty
of avoiding even the appearance of
national prejudice or religious bias
is almost insurmountable. Most of
us have our favorite authors, whose
merits we are apt to exaggerate, and
whose peculiar views we too often
accept without much investigation.
Professor Anderson is not free from
this weakness, though, as a rule, his
selections are made with discretion
and fairness. Milton's eulogy on
Cromwell is one of the exceptions,
for we hold it not good that our
children should be taught to reverence
the memory of that monstrosity
whose hands were so repeatedly
imbrued in innocent blood. Froude's
"Coronation of Anne Boleyn" is another,
for, as the readers of The Catholic
World well know, very little
dependence can be placed on the
historical veracity of that gentleman.
But the most serious mistake
of the compiler lies in the fact that
only American, English, Scotch, and
French history, with a few passages
from ancient authors, is presented;
Ireland, Spain, Germany, and other
European countries being completely
ignored. Taking into account
the vast number of children
Of German and Irish descent in our
public and private schools, who
ought, we think, to be taught something
of the history of their ancestors,
we should expect that at least
one-half of this book would be devoted
to extracts from the historians
of these races, whose writings are
now as accessible to compilers of
history as those of any other nationality.
Of Spain, the discoverer and
first colonizer of the New World, we
have not a word; and Italy, the birthplace
of Christopher Columbus and
Amerigo Vespucci, the cradle of modern
art and poetry, is altogether
overlooked. In this respect, therefore,
<cite>The Historical Reader</cite> is sadly
deficient in universality and completeness.
The Vocabulary attached
will be found useful, and the Biographical
Index would be more interesting
if the writer had used his adjectives
less generously, and more reliable
if he had not insisted on calling
Burke a British statesman and Goldsmith
an "English" writer.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">A History of the Kingdom of Kerry.</span>
By M. F. Cusack. Boston: P. Donahoe.
London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co.
1871. 8vo, pp. 512.</p></blockquote>

<p>This latest contribution to the
historical literature of Ireland is in
every respect worthy the genius and
industry of the accomplished author
of <cite>The Illustrated History of Ireland</cite>,
and other works of an historical and
biographical character. Hitherto
the remote county of Kerry has
been known to tourists and artists
for the beautiful scenery of the Killarney
Lakes, and to the general
reader only as the home of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856">[856]</a></span>
orator and politician O'Connell; for
the meagre and antiquated history
of the county by Smith has long
since passed into oblivion, and can
scarcely be found in any of those
receptacles for worn-out authors,
called second-hand book stores. It
remained for Miss Cusack (Sister
Mary Frances Clare), who, of all
contemporary Irish writers, seems
most imbued with a passionate desire
to produce and reproduce incidents
illustrative of the past glories
and sufferings of her native country,
to undertake the task of writing a
history of this, in many respects, the
most interesting of the thirty-two
counties of Ireland, and it must be
confessed that, considering the unpromising
and limited nature of the
subject, she has performed it with
wonderful accuracy and success.
The large and handsome volume
before us, as a local history, may be
considered a complete narrative of
every event connected with Kerry,
from the very earliest period of the
traditional epoch down to the close
of the seventeenth century, with
occasional glances at the affairs of
adjacent counties, when necessarily
connected with those of her favorite
locality. Several, and not the least
attractive of the chapters to a scientific
student, are devoted to the geology,
topography, and archæology of
Kerry and other kindred topics, in
the preparation of which the author
has been assisted by some of the
best scholars in Ireland, whose
readiness in thus contributing the
result of long years of study and experience
not only does credit to
their generosity and gallantry, but
demonstrates that Miss Cusack's patriotic
and charitable efforts are fully
appreciated by those who know her
well and are best fitted to appreciate
the value of her labors. The appendix,
which is very full, will be
found particularly interesting to
such of our readers as derive their
descent from the ancient Kerry
families, containing, as it does, a
minute and doubtless correct pedigrees
of the O'Connors, O'Donoghues,
O'Connells, O'Mahonys,
McCarthys, and other septs whose
names are indelibly associated with
the history and topography of the
county.</p>

<p>The illustrations of local scenery
are passable, we have seen better,
but the letterpress is excellent, and
the whole mechanical execution of
the work is worthy of the subject,
and very creditable to the taste and
enterprise of the publishers.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Manual of Geometrical and Infinitesimal
Analysis.</span> By B. Sestini,
S.J., author of Analytical Geometry,
Elementary Geometry, and a Treatise
on Algebra; Professor of Mathematics
in Woodstock College. Baltimore:
John Murphy &amp; Co. 1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>"We leave it to the reader," says
Father Sestini in his preface, which,
by the way, corresponds to the book
in shortness, "to judge whether,
without detriment to lucidity, our
efforts to combine comprehensiveness
with brevity and exactness
have been successful." It seems to
us that they have. It is impossible
to understand analytical geometry
and the calculus, the principles of
which are developed in this work,
without patient thought and application
of mind; diffuse explanations
may be written, no doubt, which will
enable an ordinary student to master
the actual text of his lesson, but they
will not be likely to set his mind to
working on its own account; and
the discovery of the meaning of a
sentence which seems obscure, but
is only so from the student's want
of mental exercise in these matters,
is of more real service, and at the
same time gives more pleasure, than
the most copious elucidations. To
use these is like taking a light into
a dark place; it shows clearly what
is immediately around, but does not
allow the pupils of the eyes to expand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857">[857]</a></span>
And without a similar development
of the mathematical
faculty, which is probably really
more common than is generally supposed,
needing only proper exercise
to bring it out, the study of the
science will be comparatively fruitless,
and a mere labor instead of a
pleasure.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible to carry
this principle too far, and make a
book which will be incomprehensible
without profuse oral explanations,
which will equally prevent a profitable
exercise of the mind. The author
seems to have carried it just far
enough. No one to whom the study
of the higher mathematics will be
profitable at all can find a better
work to set him upon the track and
give him a grasp of the subject than
F. Sestini's manual. The expert
also, as well as the student, will be
pleased with the neatness of its execution,
both in the mathematical and
in the ordinary sense.</p>

<p>New England is the home of
American local history, for, of the
works devoted to the annals of
cities, counties, and towns, there are
more relating to New England than
to all other parts of the United
States; and outside of New England
limits the cultivation of local history
is, in many cases, due to natives
of that division.</p>

<p>Miss Hemenway has done good
service by her gazetteer, which is
really a general local history of the
Green Mountain State. Known favorably
already, she has succeeded
in obtaining the hearty co-operation
of gentlemen and ladies in all parts
of the state, and she thus gives the
history of each county in turn. The
history of each church is given by
some one connected with it, and
full justice done to all. In some
local histories, the prejudice of the
author sometimes leads him to ignore
all but his own church, or give
only such notices as he cannot
avoid. We have in our eye a <cite>History
of Elizabeth, New Jersey</cite>, by
the Rev. Mr. Hatfield, in which
other denominations than his own
are very slightingly treated. There
are three Catholic churches, a Benedictine
convent, a House of Sisters
of Charity, and an orphan asylum
in the place, yet the reverend author
sums up their history in five
lines, and quotes as his authority
for their annals the City Directory.</p>

<p>If any institution, church, or author
fails to receive due space in
the <cite>Vermont Historical Gazetteer</cite>,
it is not the fault of Miss Hemenway,
who has labored most indefatigably
to extract their history, and
given them wherein to lay it before
the world, impartially allowing each
to give their own version of affairs.
Her work is, of course, not of equal
merit; but it contains many articles
of far more than local interest and
value. Her state owes her a debt
of thanks; and in her plan and
scheme of the work, as well as in
her untiring industry, she sets an
example that may well be imitated
in other states.</p>

by Ponce de Leon, in 1512,
to the Close of the Florida War,
in 1842.</span> By George R. Fairbanks.
Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.
1871.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks is not unknown as
an author, and this little volume,
handsomely issued by an eminent
publishing-house, would seem to be
a welcome addition, as furnishing,
in a compendious form, the romantic
annals of the oldest settled,
though not the oldest, state in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858">[858]</a></span>
Union. We regret to say that we
regret the appearance of the work.
There is such abundance of material
accessible to the ordinary student,
even without entering upon
the vast manuscript material which
the late Buckingham Smith spent
his life in delving, that exactness is
of the utmost necessity.</p>

<p>Mr. Fairbanks evidently quotes
his Spanish authors at second-hand,
and must be unfamiliar with the
Spanish language. No one at all
conversant with it would quote
Cabeza de Vaca, as he repeatedly
does, under the name of De Vaca.
Cabeza de Vaca is the family name,
meaning Head of Cow&mdash;an odd
name, but with its analogy in our
Whitehead, Mulford (mule-ford),
Armstrong, etc. To quote him as
"Of Cow" is like citing one of the
English names as Head, Ford, or
Strong. Quoting Garcelasso as
L'Inca also betrays ignorance. The
Spanish article is El, while the elevation
of Menendez Marques to
the Marquis de Menendez is equal
to Puss in Boots, who made marquises
offhand.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, then, to find
the period from 1568 to 1722 embraced
in 34 pages, and in those
only four references to Barcia, and
these not all correct, though in the
228 pages given by the Spanish historian
of Florida to that period
much interesting matter might have
been found.</p>

<p>Nor is his acquaintance with the
works that have appeared in English
such as we should expect.</p>

<p>The later portion of the history
seems more within his grasp; but
without entering into too great detail,
we miss any reference to Farmer's
account of the siege of Pensacola.</p>

<p>Much of the space in the earlier
portion is devoted to the French
colony and its bloody extinction by
Menendez, and to Gourgues's attack.
In this matter he does not treat the
matter as Sparks did years ago, or
Parkman recently. By all these
writers, moreover, some points are
overlooked. The piratical character
of the French cruisers, who,
after the Reformation, made religion
a cloak for their murders and piracy;
the object in selecting Florida,
which was to form a base for operations
against Spanish commerce;
the long-settled determination of
the Spanish crown to root out any
colony planted in Florida, upon the
most plausible pretext the occasion
would give; the overt acts of piracy
of the new French colony in
Florida; and, finally, the critical
position of both parties, neither of
whom, in case of victory, would
have dared to keep any of the enemy
as prisoners.</p>

<p>He takes the De Gourgues account
as the French give it, and, with
them, multiplies forts at San Mateo;
but we must confess that there are
discrepancies in it which have always
excited our distrust, although
the story is accepted generally by
French Catholic writers.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Pink and White Tyranny.</span> A Society
Novel. By Mrs. Harriet B. Stowe.
Boston: Roberts Brothers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Stowe has given us in this
volume, with her usual distinctness
of purpose, a true picture, not overdrawn,
of fashionable life as displayed
at our popular watering-places
and in many of our fashionable
homes. The author's "views," so
pronounced on all subjects, are generally
given with characteristic energy
and earnestness, if not always
with discrimination. So graphic are
her descriptions that the reader can
see the places she describes, and has
a clear insight into the hearts of her
characters.</p>

<p>It is well that one whose writings
are always so extensively read
should show up the corrupt condition
of manners and morals that
prevail in what is technically called
"high life," and in this book Mrs.
Stowe has given an interesting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_859" id="Page_859">[859]</a></span>
lifelike picture of the everyday well-known
scandals that are sapping
the very foundation of our existence
as a nation.</p>

<p>It is hardly just, however, to put
all the folly, all the extravagance,
and all the sin of our demoralized
belles and beauty to the credit of
France; poor France has enough of
her own to bear. French morals,
French manners, French novels,
French literature, and even the
French language are put down in
this volume as the source of all in
the morals of this country that is
not pure and elevating. The root
of the trouble lies nearer home, and
spreads far back to the childhood of
these vain men and women, when
they were taught that to <i>enjoy themselves</i>
was the great end for which
they were made. "Have a jolly
time in life, honestly if you can, but
have the jolly time any way," is the
chief lesson given to the children
and young persons belonging to the
world of to-day; and this peoples
our places of public resort with the
"fast" and the shameless.</p>

<p>A poetic picture of New England
life is Mrs. Stowe's specialty, and
refined, cultivated, quiet Springdale
is refreshing after the flirtations and
assignations of the watering-places.</p>

<p>We find in these pages a just and
charming tribute to the Irish character
as wife and mother; while the
author's views of marriage are in
accordance with the teachings of the
Catholic Church, and it is no small
merit in the book that it strongly
advocates the doctrine, "one with
one exclusively, and for ever."</p>

exceedingly well timed. The book,

in the church. Those who have any

The Roman Breviary thus speaks of St. Dionysius:</p>

<p>"Dionysius of Athens, one of the judges of the Areopagus, was versed
in every kind of learning. It is said that, while yet in the errors
of paganism, having noticed on the day on which Christ the Lord was
crucified that the sun was eclipsed out of the regular course, he
exclaimed: 'Either the God of nature is suffering, or the universe
is on the point of dissolution.' When afterward the Apostle Paul
came to Athens, and, being led to the Areopagus, explained the
doctrine which he preached, teaching that Christ the Lord had risen,
and that the dead would all return to life, Dionysius believed with
many others. He was then baptized by the apostle and placed over the
church in Athens. He afterward came to Rome, whence he was sent to
Gaul by Pope Clement to preach the Gospel. Rusticus, a priest, and
Eleutherius, a deacon, followed him to Paris. Here he was scourged,
together with his companions, by the Prefect Fescennius, because he
had converted many to Christianity; and, as he continued with the
greatest constancy to preach the faith, he was afterward stretched
upon a gridiron over a fire, and tortured in many other ways; as
were likewise his companions. After bearing all these sufferings
courageously and gladly, on the ninth of October, Dionysius, now more
than a hundred years of age, together with the others, was beheaded.
There is a tradition that he took up his head after it had been cut
off, and walked with it in his hands a distance of two Roman miles.
He wrote admirable and most beautiful books on the divine names, on
the heavenly and ecclesiastical hierarchy, on mystical theology; and
a number of others."</p>

<p>The Abbé Darras has published a work on the question of the
identity of Dionysius of Athens with Dionysius, first Bishop of
Paris, sustaining, with great strength and cogency of argument, the
affirmative side. The authenticity of the works which pass under his
name, although denied by nearly all modern critics, has been defended
by Mgr. Darboy, Archbishop of Paris.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed. C. W.</span>

We think it well to say that no one of these cures, except that
of Denys Bouchet, whom the physicians had pronounced absolutely and
constitutionally incurable, was declared to be miraculous by the
episcopal commission which will be mentioned further on. For these
cures, the 10th, 11th, and 16th <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès verbaux</i> of the commission
may be consulted. Whatever the probability of divine intervention may
be in such cases, the church before proclaiming a miracle requires
<i>that no natural explanation of the fact should be possible</i>, and
sets aside, without affirming or denying, every case in which this
condition is not found. She is content to say <i>Nescio</i>.</p>

<p>We shall hereafter have occasion to speak of the work of the
commission.

The reader will perhaps like to see the reports of the episcopal
commission on this case:</p>

<p>"Hardly had Catherine Latapie-Chouat plunged her hand into the water,
than she felt herself to be entirely cured; her fingers recovered
their natural suppleness and elasticity, so that she could quickly
open and shut them, and use them with as much ease as before the
accident of October, 1856.</p>

<p>"From that time she has had no more trouble with them.</p>

<p>"The deformity of the hand of Catherine Latapie, and the
impossibility of using it, being due to an anchylosis of the joints
of the fingers, and to a complete lesion of the nerves or the flexor
tendons, it is certain that the case was a very serious one; as also
by the uselessness of all the means of cure used during eighteen
months, and by the avowal of the physician, who had declared to this
woman that her condition was irremediable.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, in spite of the failure of such long and repeated
attempts, the employment of various active healing agents, and
the statement of the physician, this severe lesion disappeared
immediately. Now, this sudden disappearance of the infirmity, and
restoration of the fingers to their original state, is evidently
beyond and above the usual course of nature, and of the laws which
govern the efficacy of its agents.</p>

<p>"The means by which this result has been brought about leave no
doubt in this respect, and establish this conclusion incontestably.
In fact, it has been averred(a) that the Massabielle water is of
an ordinary character, without the least curative properties. It
cannot, then, by its natural action, have straightened the fingers of
Catherine Latapie and restored their suppleness and agility, which
had not been accomplished by the scientific remedies which were so
various and used for so long a time. The wonderful result, then,
which the mere touch of this water immediately produced, cannot be
ascribed to it, but we must rise to a superior cause, and do homage
for it to a supernatural power, of which the water of Massabielle has
been, as it were, the veil and inert instrument.</p>

<p>"Besides, if ordinary water had been possessed of such a prodigious
power, Catherine Latapie would have experienced its effect long
before by the daily use which she made of it in washing herself and
her children; for she had daily employed for this purpose water
exactly similar to that at the grotto."&mdash;<i>Extract from the 15th
procès-verbal of the commission.</i></p>

<p>(a): This was, in fact, authentically averred, the administrative
analysis to the contrary notwithstanding, at the time of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbaux</i> of the commission.
</p></div>

We will also give the conclusions of the commission on this
point.</p>

<p>"An eruptive affection of this sort might not of itself have a
very grave character, nor threaten serious danger or disastrous
consequences. Still, that from which Marianne Garrot had suffered
would indicate by its duration, by its resistance to the treatment
which had been prescribed and faithfully followed, and by its
continual and progressive spreading, a very decidedly malignant
character, the inoculation, so to speak, of a deeply seated <i>virus</i>,
to expel which would require long and persevering attention, with a
patient continuance of the treatment already adopted or of some other
more appropriate and effectual one.</p>

<p>"The rapid though not instantaneous disappearance of the white
eruption from the face of the patient is very different from the
usual effect of chemical preparations; for the first lotion produced
a perceptible improvement or partial cure <em>instantaneously</em>, which
was advanced by the second, made four days afterward; and without the
aid of any other remedy, these two lotions accomplished a complete
restoration in a few days by a gradual and rapid progress.</p>

<p>"Now, the liquid the employment of which produced this speedy effect
was nothing but water, without any special properties, and without
any relation or appropriateness to the disease which it overcame;
and which, besides, if it had possessed any such qualities, would
long before have produced the effect through the daily use which the
patient made of it for drinking and washing.</p>

<p>"This cure cannot, then, be ascribed to the natural efficacy of
the Massabielle water, and all the circumstances, as it would
seem&mdash;namely, the tenacity and activity of the eruption, the
rapidity of the cure, and the inappropriateness of the element which
brought it about&mdash;concur to show in it a cause foreign and superior
to natural agents."&mdash;<i>Extract from the 15th <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</span> of the
commission.</i>

The question, Mr. Dana really argues, is, whether Catholics in
other than the Roman state have, under the law of nations, a right to
insist that by virtue of their donations, or what the law treats as
eleemosynary gifts, they shall continue to be vested in the Holy See?
The answer must be founded on the acknowledged principle of law, that
all gifts of the sort must be invested and appropriated according to
the will of the donors; and in the interest of all Catholics in the
Holy See, as the mistress and mother of all the churches, Catholics
throughout the world have an ethical right that their gifts shall
be invested and appropriated to the purposes for which they are
given; but we doubt if their right can be juridically asserted, under
international law, in the courts of the usurping state, or of any
other state, since the state of the church is suppressed. But there
can be no doubt, from the relation of all Catholics to the Holy See,
the invasion of her rights and despoiling her of possessions, whether
absolute or only fiduciary, gives to all Catholic powers the right
of war against the invader and despoiler. At the order of the Holy
Father, Catholics throughout the world would have the right, even
without the license of their temporal sovereigns, to arm for the
recovery and restoration to the Holy See of the possessions or trusts
of which she may be despoiled, because these possessions and trusts
belong to the spirituality, and the Holy Father has plenary authority
in spirituals, and is the spiritual sovereign, not the temporal
sovereign, of all Catholics. If Italian Catholics had understood
that the Roman state belonged to the Holy See, and therefore to the
spirituality, they would have understood that no order of their
king could bind them to obey him in despoiling the Roman state, or
in entering it against the order of the Pope, for in spirituals the
spiritual sovereign overrides the temporal sovereign.

il regno del male, però l'alba è diventata giorno, la favilla si
è fatta incendio. Ora Roma del prete diviene Roma del popolo, la
città santa città umana. Non più si presti fede a credenze ipocrite,

According to some authorities, a copy of the Pandects was
discovered at Amalphi, in the middle of the twelfth century, and was
first given to the world by two Italian lawyers. D'Israeli, in his
<cite>Curiosities of Literature</cite>, says: "The original MS. of Justinian's
Code was discovered by the Pisans accidentally when they took a city
in Calabria. That vast code of laws had been in a manner unknown from
the time of that Emperor. This curious book was brought to Pisa, and,
when Pisa was taken by the Florentines, transferred to Florence,
where it is still preserved." The Code, Pandects, and Institutes are
still received as common law in Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland,
and Scotland in their entirety, and partly so in France, Spain, and
Italy.

Sir William Jones, a learned scholar and able jurist, was of
opinion that the invention of trial by jury could be traced to the
ancient Greeks, while Blackstone pretends that the credit of it is
due to the Saxons who brought the custom with them to England; but
Hallam and other superior authorities maintain that the canon quoted
in the text is the first germ on record of this great distinguished
feature of English common law, and that it was not till long after
the advent of the Normans that it assumed its present systematic form.

The continued encroachments of the crown on the rights of the
barons and their tenants led to an armed league against John I., the
leading spirit of which was the intrepid Archbishop of Canterbury
and the General, Robert Fitzwalter, who took the title of "Marshal
of the Army of God and of Holy Church." The result was a timely
concession of the king, which was granted in the form of a Great
Charter. The importance of many of the liberal guarantees set forth
in that instrument has departed with the special evils that gave
rise to them, but many of a more general nature and such as related
to cheap, speedy, and impartial justice, have become integral parts
of the British Constitution. As to the document itself, D'Israeli
relates the following curious circumstance: "Sir Thomas Cotton one
day at his tailor's discovered that the man was holding in his hand,
ready to cut up for measures, an original <i>magna charta</i>, with all
its appendages of seals and signatures. He bought the curiosity for
a trifle, and recovered in this manner what had been given over for
lost. This anecdote is told by Colomies, who long resided and died
in this country. An original <i>magna charta</i> is preserved in the
Cottonian Library; it exhibits marks of dilapidation, but whether
from the invisible scythe of time or the humble scissors of a tailor
I leave to archæological inquiry."

<p>"Continual headache; weakness of sight; amaurosis; chronic neuralgia;
partial and general paralysis; chronic rheumatism; partial or general
debility of the system; debility of early childhood. In these cases
the healing action was so sudden, that many who had not previously
believed in the reality of such cures were forced to accept them as
real and incontestable.</p>

<p>"Diseases of the spine; leucorrhea, and other diseases of women;
chronic maladies of the digestive organs; obstructions of the liver,

Every one will understand the reserve which prevents the bishop
from mentioning the universal suspicion at Lourdes, Cauterets,
Barèges, and Tarbes, of the secret action of the police in the affair
of the visionaries.</p>

<p>It would have been somewhat difficult for the prelate to say to the

nothing more nor less than yourself in the persons of your agents."

We give complete details of the analysis contained in the
report of M. Filhol. The eminent chemist continues:</p>

<p>I certify to having obtained the following results:</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">PHYSICAL AND ORGANOLEPTIC PROPERTIES OF THIS WATER.</p>

<p>It is clear, colorless, odorless: it has no decided
taste. Its density is scarcely greater than that of
distilled water.</p>

<p class="center">CHEMICAL PROPERTIES.</p>

<p>The water of the grotto of Lourdes acts as follows,
with reagents:</p>

<p>With <i>Red Tincture of Turnsol</i>.&mdash;It becomes blue.</p>

<p><i>Lime-water.</i>&mdash;The mixture becomes milky; an excess of
the water of grotto redissolves the precipitate first
formed.</p>

<p><i>Soapsuds.</i>&mdash;It becomes very cloudy.</p>

<p><i>Chloride of Barium.</i>&mdash;No apparent action.</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of Silver.</i>&mdash;Slight white precipitate, which
partly dissolves in nitric acid.</p>

<p><i>Oxalate of Ammonia.</i>&mdash;Scarcely any sensible action.</p>

<p>Submitted to the action of heat in a glass retort
communicating with a receiver, the water yielded a
gas partly absorbed by potassa. The portion thus left
undissolved was partly absorbed by phosphorus; finally,
there remained a gaseous residuum possessing all the
properties of nitrogen. At the same time that this gas
was disengaged, the water was slightly clouded and
precipitated a white deposit, slightly tinged with
red. Treated with hydrochloric acid, this deposit was
dissolved, producing a lively effervescence.</p>

<p>I saturated the acid solution with an excess of
ammonia; this reagent caused the precipitation of
several light flakes of a reddish color, which I
carefully separated. These flakes washed with distilled
water I treated with caustic potash, which took nothing
from them. I washed the flakes again, and dissolved
them in chlorhydric acid; then I further diluted the
solution with water, and submitted it to the action
of several reagents, whose effects I will proceed to
indicate:</p>

<p><i>Yellow Cyanide of Potassium and Iron.</i>&mdash;Blue
precipitate.</p>

<p><i>Ammonia.</i>&mdash;Reddish brown precipitate.</p>

<p><i>Tannin.</i>&mdash;Principally black.</p>

<p><i>Sulpho-Cyanide of Potassium.</i>&mdash;Blood-red color.</p>

<p>The liquid, separated from the flaky deposit, gave
with oxalate of ammonia an abundant white precipitate.
Having separated this precipitate by a filter, I
threw phosphate of ammonia into the clear liquid;
this reagent determined the formation of a new white
precipitate.</p>

<p>I evaporated to dryness five litres of the water,
and treated the dry residuum with a small quantity
of distilled water in order to dissolve the soluble
salts. The solution thus obtained was turned blue
by red tincture of turnsol. I again evaporated the
solution thus obtained, and poured alcohol over the dry
residuum; this being set on fire, gave a pale yellow
flame, such as is produced by salts of soda. I again
dissolved the residuum in a few drops of distilled
water, and mixed the solution with chloride of platina;
a slight canary-colored precipitate was formed in the
mixture.</p>

<p>Having acidulated two <i>litres</i> of the water of the
grotto of Lourdes with chlorhydric acid, I evaporated
it to dryness, and found the residuum taken by the
acidulated water to be but partly dissolved. The
insoluble part presented all the appearance of silica.</p>

<p>I submitted to evaporation ten <i>litres</i> of the water
of the grotto of Lourdes, in which I found a very pure
carbonate of potassa had been previously dissolved. The
result of the evaporation was moistened with boiling
alcohol, and, again evaporated to dryness, the residuum
was heated to a dull red.</p>

<p>The product of this operation was dissolved, after
cooling, in a few drops of distilled water, and mixed
with a little starch paste. Carefully treating this
mixture with weakly chlorated water, I saw the liquid
take a blue tint.</p>

<p>Submitted to distillation, the water of the grotto of
Lourdes gives a slightly alkaline distilled product.</p>

<p>From these facts it follows that the water of the
grotto of Lourdes holds in solution:</p>

<p>1. Oxygen.</p>

<p>2. Nitrogen.</p>

<p>3. Carbonic acid.</p>

<p>4. Carbonates of lime, of magnesia, and a trace of
carbonate of iron.</p>

<p>5. An alkaline carbonate or silicate, chlorides of
potassium and sodium.</p>

<p>6. Traces of sulphates of potassa and soda.</p>

<p>7. Traces of ammonia.</p>

<p>8. Traces of iodine.</p>

<p>The quantitative analysis of this water, made according
to the ordinary methods, gives the following results:</p>

as it is learned, it is still the best history of St. Cecilia. But
the learned Benedictine has only touched slightly on the influence of
St. Cecilia on the fine arts, and we have been obliged to fill out
these notes by personal research and observations made in a recent
journey to Italy.

This is not an arbitrary philosophic division. It corresponds
to the three worlds recognized by the greatest geniuses of antiquity

So in Raphael's famous picture, the pearl of the gallery at
Bologna; while its exacted symbolism and heavenly sentiment tempt us
to class it among the masterpieces of the mystic school, it must be
confessed that St. Magdalen has a very <em>earthly</em> look. We know, alas,
how this noble form has been profaned by some artists; the victim,
even after her penitence, of the sensual tastes of the Renaissance,
she remained a courtesan in the eyes of Titian and Correggio; and the
pagans of the sixteenth century have turned our saint into a nymph
lying in a grotto, or standing veiled only by the masses of her long
hair.

In this second school may be classed the pictures of Paul
Veronese and of Garofolo in the Dresden Museum. As for Carlo Dolce's
St. Cecilia, it is far sweeter, and forms the connecting link between
the rationalistic and mystic schools. We have not seen the picture,
which is in the Museum at Dresden, but it has become well-known
through engravings, and has been published by Schulger at Paris.

little appeased by that extorted act of justice. The measure was
unaccompanied by any attempt at reparation for the past. At the
very least, the old Catholic churches might have been returned to
their lawful owners. And is there any sign to-day of full justice
ever being done or half-done? None&mdash;except in the event of divine

Twenty-eighth <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</i> of the episcopal commission.</p>

<p>The following is the report of one of the physicians appointed to
examine this cure:</p>

<p>"The boy Tambourné, at five years of age, showed the symptoms of hip
disease in the first stage; very sharp pains in the knee, duller at
the hip, a turning out of the foot, lameness at first, afterwards
inability to walk without great suffering. The digestive functions
became impaired. He had a repugnance to food, and became very much
reduced. The disease, going through its first period very rapidly,
was threatening sooner or later to put an end to the child's life,
when the idea was formed of taking him to the grotto of Lourdes,
where his cure was effected instantly.</p>

<p>"The complaint of young Tambourné was of the same class as that of
Busquet, but it was more severe, having affected one of the principal
joints. Its indications were already most distressing to the eyes of
the physician who is able to see what the future has in store.</p>

<p>"It is, no doubt, possible to cure hip-disease, by the means and
processes employed by science. Natural sulphurous waters can remove
it; but in no case is it possible for them to operate with the
rapidity of lightning.</p>

<p>"Instantaneousness of action is so much beyond the healing power
by means of which such waters operate, that it may be asserted
that there is a fact in the supernatural order in all the cases of
immediate cure in which a material lesion has been involved. It
hardly needs to be stated that young Tambourné came to the grotto
carried by his mother, and that a few moments afterwards he climbed
a steep slope, walked and ran the rest of the day, without feeling
the least pain, and with as much ease as before the coming on of the
disease, etc."
</p></div>

We give in this note the report of the physicians entrusted
with the examination of this case by the episcopal commission. It is
remarkable for its circumspection. It does not dare to pronounce in
favor of a miracle; but such a reserve in so striking a case gives to
the reports in which miraculous power is recognized an authority yet
more incontestable and conclusive.</p>

<p>"Mlle. Massot-Bordenave, of Arras, aged fifty-three, was afflicted
in the month of May, 1858, with a malady which deprived her feet and
hands of part of their power and mobility. Her fingers were much
bent.... Her bread had to be cut for her. She went on foot to the
grotto, bathed her hands and feet, and went away cured.</p>

<p>"It cannot be denied that all the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prima facie</i> indications in this
case are in favor of the intervention of some supernatural cause;
but examining it with attention, we shall see that this view is
opposed by several well-founded objections. Thus, the beginning
of the trouble was hardly four months before; its character was
not alarming, being a weakness of convalescence, a diminution of
energy in the extensor and flexor muscles of the fingers and toes.
Let the nervous power flow into these muscles, under the influence
of a strong moral stimulus, and they would resume their functions
immediately. Now, may we not admit in this case that the imagination
may have become exalted by the religious sentiment, and by the hope
of becoming the recipient of a favor from heaven?"

Mr. Froude's memory is not always good. In his <cite>History of
England</cite>, vol. ix., p. 307, he tells us: "The guidance of the great
movement was snatched from the control of reason to be made over to
Calvinism; and Calvinism, could it have had the world under its feet,
would have been as merciless as the Inquisition itself. The Huguenots
and the Puritans, the Bible in one hand, the sword in the other,
were ready to make war with steel and fire against all which Europe
for ten centuries had held sacred. Fury encountered fury, fanaticism
fanaticism; <i>and wherever Calvin's spirit penetrated, the Christian
world was divided into two armies, who abhorred each other with a
bitterness exceeding the utmost malignity of mere human nature</i>."

"All the circumstances connected with this fact," says the
report of the physicians, "stamp it with a supernatural character.
It is impossible to escape from this conviction, if one considers,
on one hand, the chronic nature of the complaint which began in
1834; the force of its engendering cause, namely, the cholera; the
permanence of some of its symptoms in a most important organ of life,
the stomach; the fruitlessness of remedies applied by a competent
physician, M. Subervielle, the gradual prostration of strength,
followed inevitably by dyspepsia, and the enervation resulting from
continual pain; and, on the other hand, if one will couple with
these circumstances the effect produced by natural water, only once
applied, and the instantaneous character of the result."

taught, for, according to the Egyptian belief, the daily exercise of
the body gives young men not health, but a transient strength which
is prejudicial. As to music, it is considered not only useless, but
injurious, as rendering the mind of man effeminate."

satisfactorily explains how a slight inexactness in the histories
of Herodotus and Diodorus respecting hereditary transmission in the
class of priests and warriors, "sufficed to found on this inheritance
of pursuits and the separation of classes in Egypt, a theory that
ended by becoming completely erroneous." M. Egger, in speaking of
hereditary professions, says: "It is known that every degree of the
social scale in ancient Egypt rested on this foundation. It was for
a long time believed, according to Herodotus and Diodorus, that
the Egyptian castes were absolutely exclusive; but an interesting
memoir by J. J. Ampère (1848) proves the contrary, and scientific
discoveries daily confirm the truth of his observations." (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bulletin

Diodorus. With the exception of certain fabulous relations,
easily recognized by their mythological character, we consider
as perfectly credible the interesting details Diodorus has left
concerning the manners, laws, and institutions of ancient Egypt. He
had visited that country himself, and did not depend on the testimony
of others. "We give," says he, "the facts we have carefully examined,
which are preserved in the records of the Egyptian priesthood." After
stating that he visited that country under Ptolemy, son of Lagus,
during the 180th Olympiad, he adds: "During our travels in Egypt we
had intercourse with many priests, and conversed with a great number
of Ethiopian envoys. After carefully collecting all the information
we could find on the subject, and examining the accounts of
historians, we have only admitted into our narration facts generally
received." Lib. iii.

It could also be explained as the effect of a reaction which
often accompanies a change of dynasty. M. F. Lenormant regards this
judgment of kings as a mere fable. "The king when dead," says he,
"was as much of a god as when living." Doubtless, but the Cæsars were
also during their lives raised to the rank of divinities, which did
not prevent the Romans from killing several. We see no difficulty in
admitting the explicit testimony of Diodorus, corroborated by the
opinion of Champollion the Younger as well as his brother.
